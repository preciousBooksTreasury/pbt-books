      <p> Father and the Son as from one principle, and by one single spi ration.</p>
      <p> " And we Greeks in like manner assert and profess  that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father,  but we also believe and affirm that it is the property of the Son  that the procession should also le from Him,  and that the spiration be from both, viz. ly the Father through the Son according to essence.  And now in this unanimous profession we unite in a mutual union and join hands."</p>
      <p> This formula, drawn up in such circumstances, neither pleased all the Greeks nor all the Latins. The emperor subscribed, and the majority reluctantly followed, though some of the Greeks withdrew in disgust. And on returning to Constantinople the Greeks were ill received, more especially as the assistance promised by the Latins against the Turks was never sent. The whole proved a failure, and nothing was actually effected by all the negotiations of the council. Shortly afterwards Constantinople was taken by the Turks (A.D.  1453), the Greeks describing this as a divine judg ment upon them for the Florentine Council. On the other hand, Bellarmine says that they were delivered to the Turks because of this error.</p>
      <p> The Greek Church, notwithstanding the reluctant conces sion which was made by those who represented it at the Florentine Council, continued, after the fall of Constantinople, to assert, with not less vehemence than before, the position that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father only. No probability exists that any change will be made by the Greek Church, or that any proposal of this sort will ever be calmly considered. The correspondence into which the Tubingen divines entered subseojiently to the Reformation with the Greek patriarch, is of importance only as bringing out this fact. The sad fate of the Patriarch  CYRILLUS LUCARIS,  who had cordially accepted the distinctive doctrines of the Protes tant Church, proves the same thing. The formula which</p>
      
      <p> would have been accepted by him, that the Holy Spirit pro-ceedeth from the Father through the Son  (8t vlov],  was at once branded with the stigma of heresy by the Council of Con stantinople in 1642. Any attempt like that recently made at the Bonn Conference by Dr. Dollinger and some Anglican divines, in the line of the same formula, is only time and effort thrown away in vain negotiation.</p>
      <p> We hold strongly the view of the Western Church, which was asserted and maintained by all the Churches of the Reformation; and it might be important, did space permit, to examine the various grounds by which the Greek Church seeks to confirm her opinion, and the replies which the Greek theologians have produced to the arguments of the Western theologians. 1  They mainly appeal to the fact that the Ecu menical Council of Ephesus prohibited  (A.D.  431) as unlawful any further addition to the Nicpeno-Constantinopolitan Creed. They give no heed to the allegation of the Western Church, that the addition was only with a view to give a more precise explanation, and not to establish a new dogma. The con stantly reiterated Greek reply is, Who gave the Latin Church the authority to alter the accepted Creed of universal Christendom ?</p>
      <p> The keen feeling entertained in the Greek Church since the days of Photius still continues. We find that, so late as the Encyclical issued in 1863 at Constantinople, the doctrine involved in the  filioque  is denounced as heresy. There is no doubt that the Greeks as a body abide in this opinion, and speak and write upon it as a point of capital importance, and as essential to their system of theology.</p>
      <p> As to the importance of the doctrine from the Biblical point</p>
      <p> 1  The arguments of the Greeks for their side of the question are given with great erudition and ingenuity by the Archbishop of Novogorod, Procopovicz, in his  Tractatus de Processione Spiritus Sancti,  1772. Ernesti's erudite review of the book is replete with interest.</p>
      <p> On the Latin side of the question, the most interesting historical work is Walch's  Historia de Processione,  1751 ; Pfaffius' tractate on the same topic ; and Sweet's  History of the Doctrine to the Death of Charlemagne,  1876.</p>
      <p> T</p>
      
      <p> of view, this cannot be questioned. It will not accomplish anything to say, with Grotius, from the Indifferentist point of view, that the dispute is  a  mere logomachy. Its importance is  such that it can neither be dropped nor ignored, though Protestant theologians, such  as  Pfaffius, Walchius, and others, who have fully traced the historic course of the controversy, admit that the dogma belongs to the  less  fundamental articles, and that it should not have disturbed the peace of the Greek and Latin Churches. At the  same  time, these writers assert that he  who denies that the Holy Spirit  is  the Spirit of the Son, denies a truth, though the error may not exclude him from the hope of salvation. It is a delicate question: Was the error of the Greek Church of such a nature as to destroy the foundations  of the  faith ?</p>
      <p> Without entering into a sphere which, in truth, does not belong to man, we prefer to advert to the disastrous conse quences of its ecclesiastical denial. Every  one  who has fully traced the course of this controversy historically, and perused the solid and  massive  literature on the subject from such men as  ANSELM, ZANCHIUS,  and others, or read  LE QUIEN,  or the collection of  treatises  compiled by  LEO ALLATIUS,  or  still  more recently the publications of  PUSEY  and others, called forth by the recent Bonn  Conference,  must feel how deeply the Greek Church has placed herself in the wrong by the attitude which she  has taken up. She has acted under a one-sided and passionate feeling,  which has operated to her detriment and loss as  an  ecclesiastical  body. The unction and spirituality of the Church have been sadly affected to her disadvantage.</p>
      <p> While calm inquirers must concede that unwise steps were taken by the Western Church, and that her course of action was marked all too evidently by precipitance and mistakes, we  must  declare  with equal emphasis that the Latin Church brought out and  gave due  weight  to  a momentous truth which lies at the foundation  of the whole mission of the Comforter: How could the Son send the Spirit if the Spirit were not His ?</p>
      
      <p> We might concede that the separation of the Eastern from the Western Church can scarcely be vindicated, if the separa tion hinged on this question alone. But there is another inquiry : Has not the denial of the  filioque,  which withdrew the Greek Church from the ground occupied in Athanasius' time by the whole Church in the East and West, operated to the deep injury of vital religion in the East ? Has it not tended to subvert, in the general sentiment of the Greek mind, the deep ground on which the Lord Jesus, as Mediator, acts as the Dispenser of the Spirit, and as the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and with fire ? Has it not operated in an unsalutary way, in raising a barrier between the living Head of the Church and His people, considered as the habitation of God in the Spirit, and on the whole spiritual life of the Greek Church ? Our conviction is, that it has done so. So calami tous, indeed, have been the practical results of denying the essential relation of the Spirit as the Spirit of the Son, that we cannot fail to perceive them. The Spirit, economically considered, is largely dispensed from the Son. And the Greek Church has become much of a fossil, untouched by any of the reformations or revivals that renovated the Western Church.</p>
      <p> THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> Having sketched the course of opinion as to the Holy Spirit considered as  A PERSON OF THE GODHEAD,  we come in due course to consider the history of  THE SPIRIT'S WORK as it was discussed and canvassed in Church history in connection with the doctrine of grace. There are various marked epochs to which we shall more particularly refer, such as the testimony given forth in the time of the Pelagian Con troversy, and at the Keformation, and also in the Puritan periodâ€”of all which it may be affirmed that the clear and emphatic doctrine then declared on the Spirit's work was accompanied with a memorable revival of the spiritual life</p>
      
      <p> of the Church. As it is by no means the aim of this survey to compile a  catena patrum,  or to discuss minutely the point raised by Arminian writers, such as Whitby and Bishop Tomline, how far the Christian writers, prior to Augustin, can be regarded as giving an explicit testimony to efficacious grace, but rather to notice the great turning-points in the history of opinion, we shall only touch the prominent questions as they arose.</p>
      <p> There is a marked difference between the writers of the Greek and Latin Churches on the whole subject of the Spirit's work or on efficacious grace. From a vary early period a different view prevailed on this mysterious subject. In the Eastern and Western Church the relation of human freedom to the agency of the Spirit was, in some measure, differently viewed. The chief emphasis was laid in the Eastern Church on the freedom of the will or free agency  (TO  avre^ovcnov) ; and they spoke of a self-determining power in man even in his fallen state. On the other hand, the chief emphasis was laid in the "Western Church on the extent of corruption and the power of sin. This difference between the Oriental and Western Church was at a very early period strongly marked ; and we cannot fail to notice the germs of that peculiar historical development which gave such a different aspect to them both. The Eastern Church, neglecting to elaborate an anthropology which gave due prominence to sin, and carried away with an airy notion of metaphysical liberty unduly derived from the speculations of the Greek philosophy, wasted its strength in vindicating for man what can never be asserted in regard to him without a misconception of the ruin occasioned by the fall. The pillars of orthodoxy in the Oriental Church maintained a sort of synergism of the human will along with the agency of the divine Spirit. They ascribed to man, in his present fallen state, a choice between good and evil, and a co-operation on man's part in the application of redemption. But in elevat ing human power they diminished natural corruption. The Western Church was led into a far other path, and penetrated</p>
      
      <p> far more deeply into the doctrine of man's corrupt and fallen condition. The Greek Fathers are defective, though it must be conceded in justice to them that the vehement urgency with which they set forth free-will, was primarily due to their dread of the determinist or fatalistic theories of the Gnostics and Manichees, with whom they were surrounded. Even where the Greek Fathers set forth man's corruption and the agency of the Spirit, as is done more or less by Cyrill of Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and his brother Gregory Nyssen, they also maintain, in terms much too strong for a Biblical theologian, the power of the free-will. Thus Chrysos-tom puts the matter: " God draws, but He draws the willing one "  (e\fcei pev  @eo?, e'X/ea  Be Bov\6fj,evov^.  That defective statement was only too characteristic of the entire body of Greek theology. They never attempted to solve the question, or to remove the seeming antinomy between divine grace and free-will.</p>
      <p> The discussions in the Western Church referred more to the ruin and the remedy; and they both indicated the exist ence of a deeper spiritual life as well as increased it. The discussions in the Western Church attest that there prevailed far more profound views as to the continued operation of the Spirit on the heart. In effecting this result Augustin was, in the course of Providence, specially trained and prepared. He rendered a great service at a critical time to the whole Church. For some time subsequent to his conversion, he was not more advanced than the writers of the Greek Church, and even less matured on the subject of grace than Ambrose. His first treatise on free-will  (A.D.  388-395), which has come down to us, was meant to refute the Manichrean doctrine to which he was once attached; and it is certainly very defective. He intended it to counteract the dogma that man only acts under constraint, and from a necessity which renders it impossible for him to keep from vice arid sin. He imperfectly explains himself in reference to the operation of divine grace, but by</p>
      
      <p></p>
      <p> 294   THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> no means in antagonism to grace, as Pelagius did. About the time, however, when he received the episcopate, a decisive change took place in Augustin's opinions  (A.D.  396). The Scripture text which was made the means of leading his mind to the decisive change, which he ever afterwards asserted, was: " Who maketh thee to differ ? what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" (1 Cor. iv. 7). The conclusion to which he came was, that " in conversion God out of the unwilling makes willing ones, and dwells in those made willing;" and at a later day, when reviewing and correcting the sentiments to which he had given circulation by his pen, so far as they needed correction, we find him saying: " I have erred in having maintained that the grace of God consists only in God's revealing of His will in the declaration of truth; but that  to give assent to the preached gospel is our own work,  and that this lies in our power." And again : " I have erred in asserting  that it lies wiiliin our power to believe the gospd and to will,  but that it is the work of God to give those who believe and those who will the power of operating." Now, all was ascribed by him to the grace and Spirit of God, and nothing to man's natural power; and with marked precision the doctrine which he held was brought out in the prayer which called forth in Pelagius' mind the keenest antagonism and the greatest repugnance: " Lord, give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt" (da quod jubes et jube quod vis).</p>
      <p> Augustin was thus mentally and spiritually prepared when the Pelagian error broke out. He took its measure from the first, and at once directed all the energy of a great mind to counteract every position which was laid down in vindication of the Pelagian dogma, which found only too prepared a soil both in the West and in the East, and which it was now imperatively necessary for the welfare of vital Christianity resolutely to refute and overthrow. The error which Pelagius</p>
      
      <p> maintained was that free-will is able by its own natural powers, without the aid of the Holy Spirit,  to convert itself to God, to believe the gospel, and to be obedient to the law of God with the whole heart, and thus, with its own voluntary obedience, to merit the remission of sins and eternal life.</p>
      <p> The great powers of Augustin were called forth by the Pelagian controversy. His real aim was to prove and to assert the inward operations of the Holy Spirit on the heart in conversion and in every religious act; and the controversy, bespeaking as it does the remarkable illumination of Augustin's mind by the Holy Spirit, was accompanied and followed by results which have pervaded Western Christianity more or less to this day. Of Augustin himself, in whom we see these opinions vitally represented, we may say that subsequently to the reception of those views in which his mind found its resting-place, his whole life was a hymn of praise to the Spirit's saving grace, and a prayer for new communications of the Spirit of Life. In all that bears on man's relation to the Trinity, this remarkable man may be regarded as the meeting-place where the streams of the past united, and were sent forth anew to fertilize the future. Doctrinal truth on Eoman soil reached its culminating point in him; and whatever afterwards attained doctrinal importance, was in some way derived from the works of Augustin.</p>
      <p> Pelagius, like all natural men, however cultured, only mis took the things of the Spirit of God. His first principle was free-will. And as to original sin, it was not in his system. He asserted that Adam's fall injured his posterity only by the ill example; that grace facilitated that which could be done without it; that nothing has moral significance which does not proceed from an act of free-will; and that it was absurd to hold that an innate perversity preceded every single act. His conception of the human will was that it was always in a state of perfect equilibrium or indifference between good and evil, and that it returns as with a bound from any</p>
      
      <p> sinful action to the same equipoise. He deemed it self-con tradictory to speak of  an evil bias or a tendency to sin, which is already sin.  And in affirming, as he did, that the will turns with equal ease to good or evil,  he made sin consist in actions merely, not in the nature.  Such views of sin obscured all due perception of the great truth that the Holy Spirit must communicate a new life and anticipate the acts of the will, and heal it of its disease and of the deep inherent ground of evil which is in it since the fall of man. In a word, there is nothing in Pelagius' utterances that give the impression that he w r as a regenerate man drawn by a holy longing or aspiration toward God. The central thought of Scripture, that man was made in the divine image, and the temple of the Spirit, was reduced to a flat external ethical code that prescribes single actions. The discussion began on Pelagius' side with well-meant moral earnestness. But he had no con ception of the Holy Spirit's operations on the human heart.</p>
      <p> And when we inquire how an earnest moral nature like his, zealous against corruptions and worldly compromise, could be possessed with the pride, self-sufficiency, and elation which he betrays, the explanation is, that he was profoundly ignorant of man's natural condition, and of the indispensable necessity of the Spirit's regenerating grace. He had never comprehended Christ's words: " First make the tree good." He expected the tree to yield good fruit as it was. He had inadequate and  superficial views of sin,  having never penetrated into the true state of the heart.</p>
      <p> It must be mentioned, as some explanation,â€”though it is no palliation,â€”that the Greek Church from which he had drawn his general culture and all his theological opinions in his earlier career, was very superficial in all that sphere of doctrine and thought. So far as the Church had expressed her views in the Creed, Pelagius had embraced all the ecclesi astical doctrines on the Trinity and the Person of Christ and the Deity of the Holy Spirit. He stood where Basil and</p>
      
      <p> Athanasius and the two Gregories had stood. The meaning which he attached to grace was the natural ability for good, the gift of the  posse.  He held  tlmt the will and performance were all the mans own,  as if he had never read Paul's words (Phil. ii. 13); and that by the right use of human freedom man merited eternal life. Only when refuted by Augustin's arguments did he allow that grace took in or was exercised about the remission of sin. He allowed no  renewing influence on the will,  nothing but an external aid. Hence, in writing to Innocent of Eome, Augustin says: " Let him be sent for to Eome, and asked expressly what he means by the term GRACE  ; or let him explain his meaning by letter: and if he be found to affirm the ecclesiastical and apostolic truth, let him be fully absolved, and let us rejoice in him. For whether he calls grace free-will or remission of sins, or the precept of the law, he affirms none of those things which tend to conquer lusts and temptations  ly the supply of the Holy Spirit which He who ascended to heaven has shed on us abundantly." These last words show in what sense Augustin used the term  grace,  in contrast with the opposite opinion of Pelagius. Nothing serves more to show the defective views of grace that prevailed in the Eastern Church, than the fact that Pelagius was acquitted in  A.D.  415 at the two Synods of Jerusalem and Diospolis. The great Church-teachers of the East, while admitting man's natural sinfulness and the Spirit's agency, had continued for generations, as Augustin did in his early theological development, to assign the ultimate decision to the power of free-will. They never attempted to explain the two sides.</p>
      <p> Augustin's system had become the direct antithesis of this. Pelagius laid all stress on man's free-will. Augustin laid all emphasis on divine grace, which he understood as the effica cious and ever-continued operation of the Holy Spirit shedding abroad the love of God in the heart. Not that he denied free-will, for he maintained that  IT WAS ALWAYS FREE, BUT NOT</p>
      
      <p> ALWAYS  GOOD. His words in the third book  Hypognosticon show how free-will was admitted in ordinary things: " We acknowledge," says he, " that in all men there is a free-will; for they all, indeed, have natural innate understanding and reason; not that they are able to act in things pertaining to God as to love and fear God from the heart, but only in external works of this life have they freedom to choose good or evil. By good I mean that which nature is able to per form, as to labour in the field or not, to eat, to drink, to visit a friend or not," etc.</p>
      <p> The point which Augustin discussed was  ORIGINAL SIN AND FREE-WILL,  or the free-will after the fall of man. He proved that in and by the first man the nature of all was radically corrupted (in detenus mutata), and that we were all that one man (ille unus homo omnes fuerunt); that man was left to the freedom of his will, and by an act of abused freedom pre cipitated the race into the bondage of sin, from which no one can be freed but by the grace of God. He held that by an ill use of freedom man destroyed both himself and his free will. But Augustin is always careful to draw a distinction between the nature or substance of man which is good and the vitiating taint which has defiled it  (Encli.  vi. chap. 10). With the fall from God freedom was lost. He did not assert that the will was lost or the power to will, but that the true liberty of willing good  is lost, and in its place has come the peccandi neccssitas,  or inevitable course of sinning. Hence man can be called out of this state only by the grace of God's Spirit, which consists, according to him, not in the mere instruction of the understanding by truth, nor in the mere remission of sins, but in the renewing operations of the Holy Spirit, and in a new life of love. He describes it as creative, and as transforming the entire man  (Sp. et Lit.  iii.). He distinguishes this from everything proceeding from mere nature, and as the opposite of original sin, which, according to him, consists in evil desire (concupiscentia). Of this evil</p>
      
      <p> desire, grace is the antithesis, consisting in holy love to God. One of Augustin's deeply spiritual remarks is, that grace anti cipates the will (gratia praevenit voluntatem), and that we do not speak of God  as having given grace,  but in the present tense,  AS GIVING GRACE â€”that is, ever giving it. Even the longing for grace is God's work (volentem pnevenit ut velit, volentem subsequitur ne frustra velit).</p>
      <p> And when we inquire how grace, or the Spirit, stands related to freedom, we find Augustin's answer expressed in words which have constantly been re-echoed in different forms by Anselm, Bernard, Luther, and Calvinâ€”viz. that free-will is not made void, but established by grace (gratia sanat voluntatem,  Sp. et Lit.  xxx.). But he allowed that still there were remains of sin in the Christian. He says, in his refutation of Julian: " The law which is in our members is put away by regeneration, and yet remains in the flesh, which is mortal. It is put away,â€”for the guilt is entirely remitted by the sacrament through which believers are born again ; and yet it remains,â€”for it produces evil desires against which the believer strives."</p>
      <p> On the great question between the true doctrine of Chris tianity and the deistical religion of Pelagins, nothing can be more explicit than Augustin's testimony. Thus he says : " Neither doth a man begin to be converted or changed from evil to good by the beginnings of faith, unless the free and undeserved mercy of God work it in him. Let the grace of God, therefore, be so accounted of, that  from, the, beginnings of his conversion to the end of his perfection,  he that glorieth should glory in the Lord. Because, as  none can begin  a good work without the Lord, so none can perfect it without the Lord." And again : " It is certain that we will when we will, but He causes us to will who works in us to will" (De Grat. et Lib. Arb.  chap. ii.). To the same effect all the writers speak who imbibed Augustin's sentiments. Tims Maxentius says: " "We believe that the natural free-will is</p>
      
      <p> able to do no more than to discern and desire carnal or worldly things, which may perhaps seem glorious with men, but not with God; but those things that belong to eternal life, it can neither think, nor will, nor desire, nor perform, but only by tJie infusion and inward working of the Holy Ghost, who is also the Spirit of Christ." Fulgentius is not less explicit: " We have not received the Spirit of God because we believe, but that we may believe."</p>
      <p> Augustin's unanswerable polemic had so fully discredited Pelagianism in the field of argument, that it could no longer be made plausible to the Christian mind. It collapsed. But a new system soon presented itself, teaching that  man with his own natural powers is able to take the first step toward his conversion,  and that this obtains or merits the Spirit's assist ance. Cassian, a Scythian by birth, and a scholar of Chry-sostom, holding the rank of abbot in a Marseilles monastery, was the founder of this middle way, which came to be called SEMI-PELAGIANISM,  because it occupied intermediate ground between Pelagianism and Angustinianism, and took in ele ments from both. He acknowledged that Adam's sin ex tended to his posterity, and that human nature was corrupted by original sin. But, on the other hand, he held a system of universal grace for all men alike, making the final decision in the case of every individual dependent on the exercise of free-will. The Massilians, as they were called from Cassian's monastery, opposed and censured Augustin for permitting himself to be carried to the opposite extreme from Pelagius, and declared that he attributed too much to divine grace. Their opinions, as we learn from the letter of Prosper to Augustin, and also from the letter of Hilary, were as follows: they held that the first movement of the will in the assent of faith must be ascribed to the natural powers of the human mind. This was their primary error. Their maxim was: "it is mine to be willing  to believe, and it is the part of God's grace to assist." They asserted the sufficiency of Christ's</p>
      
      <p> grace for all, and that every one, according to his own will, obeyed or rejected the invitation, while God equally wished and equally aided all men to be saved. Prosper, in his theo logical poem,  de in gratis,  a term which he applies to these men, brings this out with much force. Cassian held that man's moral power for good is only weakened and enfeebled, but not dead, and that he has still such a sense of his disease that he can desire a cure (voluntas medicum quaerens). The entire system thus formed is a half-way house containing ele ments of error and elements of truth, and not at all differing</p>
      <p> 7  O</p>
      <p> from the Arminianism which, after the resuscitation of the doctrines of grace by the Eeformers, diffused itself in the very same way through the different Churches. Semi-Pela-gianism represented conversion as proceeding partly from man's free-will and partly from divine grace. It puts them in juxta position, and the adherents of the system were some of them more inclined to the one side, or to Pelagianism, while others inclined more to the Augustinian view. It satisfied neither.</p>
      <p> Augustin, who had triumphantly refuted Pelagianism, re ceived intelligence of what was taking place at Marseilles from his faithful Gallic scholars, Prosper and Hilary, and proceeded without loss of time to direct attention to the new phase of error. He was soon, however, to be removed from the scene of conflict to his everlasting rest. But he had the opportunity in his treatises on " Predestination," and on " The Gift of Perseverance," to prove that this half-and-half system was untenable, and in the last degree mischievous. He showed that it must lead men back to Pelagianism, if the orthodox faith was not accepted from the heart. Cassian, with a view to secure a place for the merit of works, had affirmed  that man begins the work of salvation,  and then receives as a reward further grace and aid in the path on which he has entered. It was easy to expose this unscrip-tural position, which led back the mind to the Pelagian depreciation of divine grace. Augustin appeals to the text</p>
      
      <p> which had given rest to his own mind (1 Cor. iv. V), and also to Paul's statements elsewhere (Rom. xi. 35 ; 2 Cor. iii. 5). He shows them that their position implied that they would merit grace,  by attributing to man the first commence ment. He showed, moreover, the folly of a dogma which ascribed to man the most difficult thingâ€”the commencement of a new spiritual life, and left to God's Spirit the easier task of merely conferring an aid or assistance afterwards.</p>
      <p> The principal error of the Semi-Pelagian system consisted in the fact that  grace was said to be given according to men's merits â€”that is, according to the good use or right improve ment of the natural power of free-will. But grace was often used by them to intimate nothing more than the law and the prophets. After a century of discussion the inner contradic tion of Semi-Pelagianism became apparent, and at the Synod of Orange  (A.D.  529) it was repudiated in a series of positions or doctrinal statements, which may be said not only to have given this heresy a decisive check, but to have exhibited the truth with a precision, accuracy, and fulness than which we have scarcely anything more condensed and valuable on this topic in the whole compass of theological literature. Though it was but a provincial Synod,  it came to Jiave all the validity of an Ecumenical Council.  It puts together the results of the whole previous discussions on Pelagianism and Semi-Pela-gianism, and has the further advantage of being specially directed to the divine operation in the matter of regenera tion. I shall subjoin the first seven  CANONS  of this memor able Synod, as containing the soundest and most scriptural utterances on this momentous topic:â€”</p>
      <p> " 1. If any man affirm that the whole man in soul and body has not been corrupted by Adam's transgression, but that the body only is subject to corruption, while the freedom of the soul remains unhurt, that man, seduced by Pelagius' error, contradicts the Scripture, which says: ' The soul that sinneth, it shall die.'</p>
      
      <p> " 2. If any man affirm that Adam's transgression only injured himself, but not his posterity, or that only corporeal death, the punishment of sin, but not sin itself, which is the death of the soul, passed by one man to the entire human family, he ascribes injustice to God, contradicting the apostle (Rom. v. 12).</p>
      <p> "3. If any man say that the grace of God is given at man's petition, but not that grace produces the supplication, he contradicts the prophet Isaiah, who says, and the apostle who says the same: ' I am sought of them who asked not after me: I am found of them who sought me not' (Isa. Ixv. 1).</p>
      <p> " 4. If any man affirm that God waits for our will that we may be purged from sin, and does not confess  that it is due to the infusion and operation of the Holy Ghost  upon us that we desire to be cleansed, he resists the Holy Ghost Himself, who says that the will is prepared by God; and the apostle's testi mony, that it is God who worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</p>
      <p> "5. If any one say that the beginning or increase of faith, and the very movement of mind toward faith by which we believe in Him that justifies the ungodly, and come to the regeneration of baptism, is in us not by the gift of grace,â€” that is,  ly the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,  correcting our will from unbelief to faith, from ungodliness to piety,â€”but by nature, he is proved an enemy to the doctrine of the apostles, as Paul says: ' He that hath begun a good work in you will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ;' and again: ' To you it is given in Christ not only to believe, but also to suffer for His sake' (Phil. i. 6, 29). They who affirm that the faith by which we believe in God is natural, describe all who are estranged from the Church as in a manner believers.</p>
      <p> " 6. If any man affirm that mercy is imparted to us when, without the grace of God, we believe, will, desire, endeavour, watch and labour, pray, seek and knock, and does not confess</p>
      
      <p> that it is of the inspiration and infusion of the Spirit of God that we can believe, will, or do any of all these things as we ought,â€”who merely affirms that the aid of grace is added to the humility and obedience of man, and does not confess that our obedience and humility is a gift of His grace,â€”he contra dicts the apostle, who says: ' What hast thou that thou hast not received ?' and: ' By the grace of God I am what I am.'</p>
      <p> " 7. If any man affirm that he can by the strength of nature think anything good pertaining to the salvation of eternal life, as he ought, or choose or consent to the saving or evangelical preaching,  without the illumination and inspi ration of the Holy Spirit,  who gives to all the sweet relish in consenting to and believing the truth, he is deceived by a heretical spirit, not understanding the word of God in the gospel: 'Without me ye can do nothing;' and that saying of the apostle: ' Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves' (2 Cor. iii. 5)."</p>
      <p> A historical succession of testimonies to the same effect might be supplied from Maxentius, Fulgentius, Albinus, Gregory the Great, and others, which would be found to be equally clear and interesting. But as the object of this sketch is only to notice the salient points of history, I shall refrain from entering into these details, and content myself with quoting a few words of the treatise " on the calling of the Gentiles," of which Leo has been supposed by many to be the author, though the writer in reality is unknown. After saying that it would be ruinous to be deprived of the Holy Spirit, the writer adds: " He" [the Spirit] indeed, in the essence of the Deity, is everywhere and all-comprehen sive, but is conceived in a certain manner to recede from those whom He ceases to govern. And  the cessation of His aid is to be regarded as His absence,  which that man madly thinks useful to himself who rejoices in his good actions, and thinks that he rather than God hath wrought them. The "race of God must therefore be owned in the fullest</p>
      
      <p> and most unqualified sense, the first office of which is that His help be felt: " We have not received," says the apostle, " the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God." Whence, if any man think that he has any good things of which God is not the author, but himself,  he has not the Spirit of God, but of the world,  and swells with that secular wisdom of which it is written: " I will destroy the wisdom of the wise."</p>
      <p> A long intervening period followed, during which eccle siastical opinion, with many fluctuations of a downward tendency, was still publicly controlled by the Canons of the Synod of Orange. That much was done in defence of the doctrines of grace by the writers â€¢ whom I have already mentioned as opposed to Semi-Pelagianism, and tending effectually to counteract the efforts of Cassian, Faustus, Vincentius Lorinensis, and the like, and to discredit the Semi-Pelagian views, cannot be questioned. But it is too evident that pure Augustinianism was by no means accepted in every quarter. We see this in the fate of Godeschalc, and in other incidents of a like nature.</p>
      <p> We come next to Bernard, who strenuously asserted Augustin's views, and \vho in virtue of doing so became one of the most powerful characters that shed an ennobling influence on the mediaeval Church. Bernard's treatise ox GRACE AND FREE-WILL  is singularly fresh and accurate, and his age, as Neander has well pointed out, was a new spring time of spiritual life after a long winter. At the beginning of the twelfth century a new creative epoch entered, and a new outpouring of the Holy Ghost, when religion, though still mingled with foreign elements, decidedly revived among the nations. Bernard was the representative of that mystic or pectoral theology which runs through the mediaeval period wherever it shows spiritual elements. The stream of religious thought may be said to have divided in two from his time, the one more scholastic, the other more mystic. The defini-</p>
      <p> u</p>
      
      <p> tions and distinctions supplied by Bernard are often of the happiest. Thus he says: " Simply to will comes from man's nature; to will wickedly comes from corrupt nature; to will well, from supernatural grace." Another passage from his treatise on grace and free-will is as follows: " You say,  What, then, is it that free-will does ? I answer briefly, It is made â€¢ichole  (salvatur). Take away free-will, and there will be nothing to be healed. Take away grace, and there will be no healing influence (non erit unde salvetur). This work cannot be effected without the twoâ€”the one the cause by which it is accomplished, the other the subject on which, or in which, it is accomplished. God is the author of salvation â€¢' free-will is only capable of receiving it (tantum capax)."</p>
      <p> The transition - stage between Bernard and the epoch of the Reformation was the period of mediaeval mysticism. This mystic theology, influenced as it was by vivid views of the Holy Spirit, may be said to have moved on a twofold hingeâ€” on the sense of sin, blindness, inability, and defilement on the one hand; and on the great deliverance from all parts of moral and spiritual ruin, which is hourly to be found from Christ's Spirit, on the other. Introverting its regards, this school of theology occupied itself with the personal Redeemer, and with the restoration of light, life, and holiness by the Holy Spirit. The centre round which tin's whole theology moved was fellowship of life with the Redeemer through the Holy Ghost; and it was destined to scatter the seed, and prepare the way for the clearer views of the Reformation epoch. It may be said that the mystic element, though insufficient of itself to give rise to a general reformation, stands connected with almost every true revival or great religious movement that has ever taken place. In some cases, it goes before as an indispensable preliminary. In others, it comes in as a tribu tary stream, or as a necessary complement when a movement threatens to decay. The labours of the older mysticsâ€” Eckart, Tauler, a Kempis, Wessel, and the author of the</p>
      
      <p> Theologia Germanica â€”stood in a definite relation to the full development of Christian doctrine at the Eeformation. The felt distance from God, the deep solitude of their hearts, their desires for the present enjoyment of God as their proper elementâ€”these and similar feelings awakened by the Holy Spirit were uttered by these writers in mystic language, and from a mystic point of view; but they served to some con siderable extent to rescue a large class from the terrible infliction of ecclesiastical form or a mere dead orthodoxy. But the mystic element which limits its regards to  CHRIST IN us, and which fails to give prominence to Christ's merits  FOR us, never of itself produced a widespread renovation of spiritual life. It was ignorant of the liberty derived from imputed righteousnessâ€”that is, was ignorant of the true ground and indispensable condition of the communication of the Spirit, and of all filial communion with God. And it bears, when it stands alone, the elements of decay and dete rioration in itself. But the great witnesses of free grace and of Christ's merits and atonement, whether we think of one period or another,â€”such as Luther, Whitefield, Venn, and others,â€”were all moulded in their first stage by these views.</p>
      <p> THE PERIOD OF THE REFORMATION.</p>
      <p> The period of  THE EEFORMATION,  to which we now come, gave a testimony to the Holy Spirit more full and explicit than had ever been uttered since the apostolic age. 1 Considered in its origin, the Eeformation was itself a great work of the Spirit of God, and the men who bore a leading part in it were fully conscious of this fact. The Semi-Pelagianism and the Pelagianism in its worst form, which had insinuated itself into the theology of mediaeval times,</p>
      <p> 1  See Luthardt,  die Lehre vom Freien Willen,  Leipz. 1863; Dieckhoffs Luther's Lehre von der Gnade Theol. Zeltsch.  1860 ; Frank,  die Thcoloyie der F. Concordice;  Kostlin's  Luther's Theoloyte,  1863.</p>
      
      <p> were denounced in the most unsparing terms. The Augus-tinian views were proclaimed with full emphasis and with resuscitated vigour. But these doctrines, from the altered circumstances, received a new application and a new direction in several respects. The term  GRACE,  for instance, which in Augustin's acceptation intimated the inward exercise of love awakened by the operations of the Holy Spirit (Rom. v. 5), and which in the scholastic theology had come to denote a quality of the soul, or the inward endowments, and infused habits of faith, love, and hope, was now taken in the more scriptural and wider sense for the free, the efficacious  FAVOUR which is in the divine mind. Luther extended the meaning according to the terms of Scripture ; and Melanchthon ex pressed a regret that theologians had not rather used the term FAVOUR.  The Reformers having to use the term grace or free favour in connection with justification through Christ's righteousness, began largely to use the phrase: " the work of the Holy Spirit," instead of the term " grace."</p>
      <p> The Reformers connected faith as the receptive organ or hand by which men receive the imputed righteousness which justifies us in the closest possible way with the operation of the Holy Spirit as its author or producing cause. While they asserted the first point, that justification before God proceeds only from faith, they asserted not less strongly the second point, that faith in the heart proceeds only from God's Spirit.  And on all occasions they declared that if there be allowed in man any natural power or natural capacity for believing without the operation of the Holy Spirit, this inevitably overthrows at the second stage the very doctrine of grace which had been laid as the foundation of all. To show this, we need only advert to the way in which Luther expressed himself a very few years after the Reformation began. The Reformer had frequently declared that " in divine and spiritual things we have no free-will, but only in name." He said: " That any one should be represented as just and fearing God  who has not</p>
      
      <p> the Spirit,  would be the same as if Belial were called Christ." And when Erasmus was prevailed on to attempt a refutation of Luther, he assailed him on a point which some accounted not a central oneâ€”the doctrine of free-will, or the natural power of man. That was not Luther's opinion. "I must own," said Luther, " that you alone in this contest have seized your antagonist by the throat. I thank you for this with all my heart; for I am better pleased to engage on that subject than on all those secondary questions of the Pope, purgatory, and indulgences, with which the enemies of the gospel have teazed me till now." Luther's treatise in reply to Erasmus, bearing the title  de servo arbitrio,  undoubtedly one of the most powerful treatises ever written on the subject of which it treats, overthrows the open Pelagianism of Erasmus, who knew little of theology, and the Semi-Pelagianism of men less extreme in their opinions than Erasmus; and it proves to demonstration that the representation of free-will which he impugns, overthrows Christ's work  FOR  us and the Spirit's work  IN  us. Almost the only thing that one regrets about this noble production is not its vehemence, which was the natural utterance of the writer,â€”nor the strong statements about man being under the power of Satan,â€”nor the representation of the will as resembling the motionless inaction or immobility of a stock or stone, for these, though lamented by some, will not appear extravagant exaggerations to one enlightened as Luther was,â€”but the title of the book. Had the title been de libero arbitrio et servo,  indicating the natural indefeasible freedom of the human being, arid yet the ground of  evil in the will itself,  both sides of the momentous question would have been suitably recognised. For there are times when the Church is compelledâ€”as, for instance, in antagonism to the stoical philosophy, to the Gnostic, Manichoean, Pantheistic, and Deterrninist theoriesâ€”to lay emphasis on the freedom of the will, as well as on its bondage. These are the two sides, neither of which can be unduly pressed without the other as its</p>
      
      <p> necessary complement. Hence in Augustin's time the twofold question bringing the t\vo sides of truth to light, and running in direct antagonism to two prevailing errors, was always put as follows : " Without free-will, how shall God judge the world ? "Without grace, how shall God save the world ?" These are the two sides of truth, neither of which can ever be long left in abeyance ; and the Church, through the whole tenor of her history, has ever been compelled to exhibit both, sometimes in the same age enforcing the one against Fatalism, and the other against an arrogant Semi-Pelagianism. It was against the latter that the Reformers had more especially to testify.</p>
      <p> After the allusion to Luther's treatise " on the bondage of the will," it is not necessary to put together at any length a collection of Luther's sayings on this topic. A few sentences â€¢will suffice as a specimen. Thus he says: " We have  need of the Spirit of Christ,  without whom all our works are only worthy of condemnation" (damnabilia). And again: " I reject and condemn as erroneous every doctrine which extols our free-will, and fights against the assistance and grace of our Saviour Jesus Christ; because without Christ death and sin rule over us, and the devil is the god and prince of the unconverted world." The noble words of the Reformer toward the close of his treatise  de servo arlitrio  are as follows : " I confess for myself, that even if it were possible /  would not have free-will committed to me,  or anything whatever left in my hand whereby I might endeavour after salvation; not merely because I could not, amid so many adversaries and dangers, and, moreover, opposing devils, withstand and retain itâ€”since one devil is more powerful than all men, and no one would be saved; but because, even though there were no hazards, no adversaries, no devils, I should be constrained perpetually to labour in uncertainty, and to beat the air." Calvin is in full harmony with Luther, and constantly appeals to Augustin's views; and it is not necessary to do more than refer to his  Institutes.</p>
      
      <p> We shall now refer succinctly to the doctrinal views of the Protestant Churches, Lutheran and Reformed. Never since the days of the apostles had anything been defined or preached in reference to the operations of the Holy Spirit more full, accurate, and ample than was set forth in all the Pro testant Churches under the blaze of light which shone all around. The Lutheran theologian Hunnius thus expressed himself: " It is most firmly believed in our Churches that in divine and spiritual things we have no free-will, but only in name ;" and adds, " Not a particle of what Erasmus contends for now remains to man, and where any such ability for what is good is to be met with,  it is to Toe, ascribed entirely to the Holy Spirit" (de Lib. Art.}.</p>
      <p> Without going into the vast mass of theological writing which was produced at the period of the Reformation on the Spirit's operations, it will be easier, as well as more com pendious, to refer to the symbolic books or confessions, and to the catechisms which the various Churches have given forth as public documents, and which were designed to express the Church's faith, and to serve as the rule of teaching for the young. It appears that on the gracious operations of the Spirit, Zwingli, Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, Martyr, Olivian, Ursinus, and others that might be named, were in perfect harmony with the great writers of the Lutheran Church. In a word, the sun of grace shone in the heavens, and the operations of the Spirit of grace in that bright period of the Church's purity and zeal were recognised with one consent on every side. As we must study brevity, let it suffice to say that the harmony of the Protestant Confessions exhibits the Church - consciousness more fully than can be found in the individual authorship of the Churches. Not only so: confessional documents em bodying the convictions of collective bodies have a signifi cance that cannot attach to individual writers, however eminent. A few extracts here will suffice.</p>
      
      <p> THE AUGSBURG CONFESSION,  the Lutheran symbol, says (Article xviii.): " Concerning free-will it is taught that to some extent man has freedom of will to lead a just and honourable life, to choose between things which reason com prehends ; but without grace, assistance, and the operation of the Holy Spirit, he is unable to become pleasing to God, or to fear God in heart, or to believe in Him, or to cast out of his heart the innate evil propensity ; but  these things arc effected through the, Holy Spirit,  which is given through the word of God."</p>
      <p> THE CGNCORDIJE FORMUL.E,  another Lutheran symbol, says on free-will in the epitome: " It is rightly said, however, on the contrary, that  in conversion, God, through the draining of the, Holy Spirit, makes willing men out of the obstinate, and un willing ;  and that  after such conversion the regenerated will  of man does not remain inactive in the daily exercise of repent ance, but  co-operates in all the works of the Holy Spirit which He performs through us."</p>
      <p> "  Also that Doctor Luther has written that the will of man in his conversion remains purely passiveâ€”that is, that it does nothing at all, is to be understood  rcspcctu divinec graticc in acccndcndis novis rnotibus â€”that is, when  THE SPIRIT  OF GOD  through the heard word, or through the use of the holy sacraments,  lays hold on the will of man  and effects the new birth and conversion. For, when  the Holy Spirit  has effected and accomplished this,  and through His divine power and operation alone  has changed and renewed the will of man, then the new will of man is an instrument and organ of God the Holy Spirit, so that it not only accepts the grace, but also co-operates in subsequent works of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> " Consequently, that before the conversion of man there are but two efficient causes found, namely,  THE HOLY SPIRIT, and  THE WORD OF GOD  as the instrument of the Holy Spirit, through which He effects conversion, and which man is to hear; he cannot, however, give credence to it and accept it</p>
      
      <p> through his own powers, but exclusively through the grace and operation of God the Holy Spirit."</p>
      <p> We pass to  THE EEFORMED CHURCH,  and shall begin with THE HELVETIC CONFESSION,  the most widely accepted of the Reformed Confessions. This Confession distinguishes very happily, as the CoNCORDLE  FORMULA  also does, and as the WESTMINSTER CONFESSION  did afterwards, between man  FREE and upright before the fall, and man fallen, with  no free-will to do good after the fall.  It is then added : " In regeneration the understanding is  enlightened ly the Holy Spirit  to under stand both the mysteries and the will of God, and  the will itself is not only changed ly the Spirit,  but also furnished with powers both to will and to do good spontaneously (Rom. viii. 5, 6)."</p>
      <p> In  THE SCOTTISH CONFESSION  (Article xii.) we read: " We are so dead, so blind, so perverse, that neither can we feel when we are pricked, see the light when it shines, nor assent to the will of God when it is revealed,  except the Spirit of the Lord Jesus quicken that which is dead,  remove the darkness from our minds, and bow our stubborn wills to the obedience of the blessed gospel."</p>
      <p> In  THE FRENCH CONFESSION  the words are: " We believe that  ~by the secret grace of the Holy Spirit  we are made par takers of the light of faith, which is the gracious gift of God, and peculiar to those alone to whom God sees meet to impart it."</p>
      <p> In  THE CONFESSION OF BASIL  we read: " Our nature is so vitiated, and has such a propensity to sin, that  unless it is renewed ly the Holy Spirit,  no man can do or will what is good of himself."</p>
      <p> In all the Catechisms of the Protestant Church, in Calvin's Catechism, in the Heidelberg Catechism, as well as Luther's, the testimony to the doctrine of the Spirit is definite and ample.</p>
      <p> We   come  next   to a   period   of declension.     After   the</p>
      
      <p> ecclesiastical confession to the doctrine of the Spirit in the clear emphatic manner already mentioned, there followed a period of decline and conflict, and this may be traced in all similar epochs in history. Two phases of opinion, having much in common with each other, broke out shortly after the Reformationâ€”the synergistic error in the Lutheran Church, and Arminianism in the Reformed Church. They ran counter to the true doctrine of the Spirit and the homage which is due to the Holy Spirit. They insinuated themselves into both Churches by conceding to the free-will or natural power of man more than the Reformers had acknowledged. They were opinions which led to disastrous consequences in both the Churches, and broke the force of the Reformation.</p>
      <p> The synergism which broke out through the influence of Melanchthon in the Lutheran Church had everything in common with the synergistic views of the Greek Church as represented by all her great writersâ€”Basil, the Gregories, Chrysostom, and others. Arminianism, again, in the Reformed Church, was simply a revival of Serni-Pelagianism.</p>
      <p> To begin with Synergism. The rise of this controversy, which came to be agitated shortly after Luther's death, was due to the fact that Melanchthon changed his opinion on the subject of free-will and the natural power of man. He had held, with Luther, man's natural inability, and in the first edition of his Common-places went farther in the way of denying all liberty than can be vindicated. He began to waver and vacillate after Erasmus published his polemical treatises against Luther, and by an enlarged study of the Greek Fathers, to whom he was already approximating on the subject of free-will. The change discovered itself in germ in the second edition of his  Loci Communes  (A.D.  1535), when he began to speak of three causes in conversionâ€”the word of God, the Holy Spirit, and the human will (non sane otiosa). He next spoke of the human will  assenting  to the word of God. Then, two years after Luther's death, he describes free-</p>
      
      <p> will as the faculty in man of applying himself to divine grace (1548)â€”that is, the ability of applying himself to divine grace in some way. He began to view the human will not so much as the thing to be changed, but as a factor or con curring cause in conversion, though he only once uses the term " co-operation."</p>
      <p> When this lamentable controversy began in 1555, the followers of  Melanchthon  took up the position that man is not merely passive in conversion, but a co-operating cause. Strigel of Jena threw himself with all his energy into the controversy, and openly declared himself in a synergistic sense. Not to mention others, Flacius, the admirer of Luther, and one of the richest as well as most erudite minds that adorned that age, became a vehement assailant of the synergistic opinions. The controversy, as is often the case, seemed some times to turn on a razor's edge, and yet truth was on one side and error on the other. Strigel, though he continued to de clare that a man could not convert himself without the Holy Spirit, advanced, without doubt, to Semi-Pelagian views when he maintained the human self-determination in the matter of conversion. Flacius, again, starts with the assertion of man's total incapacity for good, and that the divine operation of the Holy Spirit alone gives rise to true conversion. But he committed himself to positions on original sin which were so extreme that they outraged the theological mind both of the Lutheran and Keformed Church. He went so far as to affirm that  sin had become the very substance of man â€”an extravagance which repelled every mind, and involved the fearful conse quence that on such a theory man could not be a subject of redemption.</p>
      <p> The two parties in this controversy largely destroyed each other's arguments, and needed the intervention of a third party to mediate between them and readjust the balance of truth. And this was the very issue that the course of events brought about. Strigel contended that the Spirit's action</p>
      
      <p> corresponds to the peculiar nature of the will, but not so as to destroy the will. lie held that the Spirit's action on man as a free agent was different from the way in which power is exercised on mere inanimate and unconscious objects, as a stock or stone, and that co-action could not be applied to the will (voluntas non potest cogi). No one will hesitate to say that so far he was right. But the questionable part of his argument begins to appear when he insists on a natural aptitude or power in the will of man for good. He would not allow that the natural man was but passive in the act of conversion. He held that man is not so much dead as sick ; and he contended that the power for good is not so much lost as enfeebled, bound, or fettered by sin, so that it can do nothing without the Holy Ghost; but that when freed it co operates to conversion, though in a languid way. He held that the human will cannot without the Spirit begin its con version, but that it is not a resisting or merely passive element. The affinity of this view, or rather its perfect identity with Semi-Pelagianism, cannot be doubtful. He seems to have known nothing in his own experience of a sudden conversion by divine grace; and he speaks as if it could not be without the concurrence of a divine and human cause.</p>
      <p> Flacius, on his side of the argument, demands whence arises the will to good, the very inclination to conversion, and the prayer for it ? Does this come from God alone, or partly from the synergism of man ? He adds, " I demand whether you say that the will co-operates before the gift of faith or after the reception of faith ?"</p>
      <p> The Formula Concordke, prepared by Brentius, Andrea, and others, came in to put this matter on its right ground, and to correct extremes, when the Lutheran Church was in volved in the most critical danger. It repudiated, on the one side, the error that from the human will could come the first beginnings of conversion or anything truly good till grace first apprehends it and replenishes it with new powers; and on</p>
      
      <p> the other side the revolting dogma of Flacius, that original sin had become the essence of man. Its admirably-balanced statements bring out that  conversion has its efficient cause only in the operation of the Holy Ghost, and that man neither effects it nor co-operates in it.  It is stated that the Holy Spirit acts on the will of man, the subject of the change,â€”that the operation is ON the will and  IN  the will by means of the word. It repudiates the active synergism of Strigel and the continuous resistance of Flacius, who contended that before and after conversion the human will does nothing but resist. It sets forth that after conversion, but only after conversion, the mind with new powers begins actively to co-operate.</p>
      <p> THE UNITARIAN MOVEMENT,  begun by Socinius and carried on by the Polish Brethren  (Fratres Poloni],  developed a bold attack on the Holy Spirit, both in regard to His personality and His work. As, however, it was only another phase of Naturalism or Deism, as well as directly anti-Trinitarian, it could not secure a footing within the Church, and was at once expelled.</p>
      <p> But the  ARMINIAN MOVEMENT,  identical in all respects with Semi-Pelagianism, insinuated itself into the Reformed Churches, and became a very formidable power, which spread in all directions, and can scarcely even yet be said to have spent its force. The founder of it was Arminius, born in 1560, a man of distinguished gifts, who, by the aid of bene volent friends, had been helped forward in his studies till he was sent to prosecute his theological curriculum under Beza in 1582. Everything in his history subsequent to thisâ€”his visit to Italy, his acquaintance with Bellarmine, the suspicious awakened by his utterances after being promoted to the pas torate in Amsterdam  (A.D.  1588), and the doubts entertained as to his opinions when called to be Junius' successor in the chair of Theology at Leyden, though he declared that he held with Augustin, and repudiated the Pelagian tenetsâ€”creates a doubt whether the doctrines of grace were ever fully accepted</p>
      
      <p> by him. About a year after entering upon his theological duties at Leyden, opinions were propounded by him at variance with the doctrine of the Reformed Church (1604). Then began the controversy which convulsed the Dutch Church.</p>
      <p> "Without entering into all Arminius' opinions, let me briefly notice those which referred to the Holy Spirit. He maintained that the Spirit's operation was in every case resistible, and  that there was no invincible efficacy put forth on any  to whom the gospel is preached. The assent of the will was said to decide the matter. It was held that every one could obey or resist; that the cause of conversion was not the Holy Spirit so much as the human will concurring or co-operating ; and that this was the immediate cause of con version. Let me briefly notice the points which came up in these discussions.</p>
      <p> As to the subjects of conversion, it was a question whether the Holy Spirit exercised the same gracious operation on every hearer to whom the gospel is first proclaimed. This was affirmed by the Arminians. Not only so : they condemned it as an unwarrantable  limitation of the grace of God to hold that the Huly Spirit effectually u'ork-s faith in any  by removing the resistance of the mind, and by imparting the power to believe-In a word, while nominally allowing the action of the Spirit, it came to this: that it was an inefficacious and resistible influence, little moreâ€”if, indeed, it was anything moreâ€” than external suasion.</p>
      <p> They placed themselves on the same footing with the Semi-Pelagians as to everything bearing on the universality of the Spirit's grace, as to the equality which must be allowed to all men, and as to the sufficiency of grace for all alike. They took the decision of the matter  out of God's free-will,  which they challenged, and  put it into man's free-will,  which they maintained. The question was formally raised: Were all converted that the Spirit intended to convert by the gospel ?</p>
      
      <p> and at the Hague Conference, the Arminians, without scruple or reserve, laid down the position that the Holy Spirit, when He operates on man with the intention of converting him, can be resisted  (Coll. Hag.  p. 227). Sufficient grace was strongly asserted ; by which phrase they intimated that assistance was given only in such a way and measure that at his own dis cretion a man could take the decisive step, and that the will can help itself to the act of faith. But  they denied that the Spirit conferred the gift of faith.  That the Holy Spirit im parts the renewing of the will, or introduces a new quality into the will, rendering it certain that faith shall ensue, they denied. They allowed  only assistance,  but denied that the will is inclined by the Spirit of God. They insisted that the Holy Spirit never operates on the will of men except in such a way as could be resisted. And they openly denied that faith  could be called  the gift of God,  as wrought by the Spirit of God.</p>
      <p> These Arminian tenets run counter to all the invincible energy which makes faith the gift of the Spirit of God. They throw man back on himself, and make all dependent on the human will in the application of redemption, forgetting that man has  AS LITTLE POWER  as  MERIT.  On the contrary, the Confessions all testified according to Scripture that the willâ€” in other words, that the carnal mindâ€”is enmity against God, and that the Spirit's operations are effectual. These are not so languid as to stop short of taking away the stony heart.</p>
      <p> After many years' discussion on these points, in which the true life of the Church consists, the Synod of Dort was assembled [13th Nov. 1618 to 9th May 1619] to give an ecclesiastical decision on them. Representatives were in vited from all the Reformed Churches, and these deputies eagerly came to that great Council, except where the Govern ments, from jealousy, refused permission to attend, which was the case with France. All the topics were discussed with fairness, erudition, and zeal for truth. This great Synod,</p>
      
      <p> equal in importance to any of the Ecumenical Councils, is the glory of the Reformed Church. Since the first  FOUR GENERAL COUNCILS,  none have ever assembled with a more momentous charge or commission. It gave forth in its decrees a full and all - sided outline of the doctrines of special grace; and nobly was its work discharged. The decrees of the Synod were not only made the fundamental articles of the Dutch Church, but continue, as part of the literature of these questions, to have a significance for all time. And it may be questioned whether anything more valuable as an ecclesiastical testimony for the doctrines of sovereign, special, efficacious grace was ever prepared on this important theme since the days of the apostles. Its great point was to show that  THE SPIRIT PRODUCES ALL, AND MAN ACTS ALL.</p>
      <p> Nowhere has the renewing work of the Holy Spirit been more correctly and fully exhibited than in the Canons of  THE SYNOD OF DORT,  from which I shall quote only the following articles in the division containing the third and fourth Heads of Doctrine:â€”</p>
      <p> " Article VIII.â€”As many as are called by the gospel are uufeignedly  (scrio)  called: for God hath most earnestly and truly declared in His word what will be acceptable to Himâ€” namely, that all who are called should comply with the invitation. He, moreover, seriously promises eternal life and rest to as many as shall come to Him, and believe on Him.</p>
      <p> " Article IX.â€”It is not the fault of the gospel, nor of Christ offered therein, nor of God, who calls men by the gospel, and confers upon them various gifts, that those who are called by the ministry of the word refuse to come and be converted. The fault lies in themselves: some of whom when called, regardless of their danger  (sccuri),  reject the word of life; others, though they receive it  (admittunf),  suffer it not to make a lasting impression on their heart  (immittunt), therefore their joy, arising only from a temporary faith, soon vanishes, and they fall away; while others choke the seed of</p>
      
      <p> the word by perplexing cares and the pleasures of this world, and produce no fruit. This our Saviour teaches in the parable of the sower, Matt. xiii.</p>
      <p> " Article X.â€”But that others who are called by the gospel obey the call and are converted, is not to be ascribed to the proper exercise of free-will, whereby one distinguishes himself above others equally furnished with grace sufficient for faith and conversion, as the proud heresy of Pelagius maintains; but it must be wholly to God, who, as He hath chosen His own from eternity in Christ, so He confers upon them faith and repentance, rescues them from the power of darkness, and translates them into the kingdom of His own Son, that they may show forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His marvellous light; and may glory, not in themselves, but in the Lord, according to the testimony of the apostles in various places.</p>
      <p> " Article XLâ€”But when God accomplishes His good plea sure, or works in them true conversion, He not only causes the gospel to be externally preached to them, and powerfully illuminates their minds by His Holy Spirit that they may rightly understand and discern the things of the Spirit of God ; but by the efficacy of the same regenerating Spirit He pervades the inmost recesses of the man; He opens the closed and softens the hardened heart, and circumcises that which was uncircumcised; infuses new qualities into the will which, though heretofore dead, He quickens; from being evil, dis obedient, and refractory, He renders it good, obedient, and pliable; actuates and strengthens it, that, like a good tree, it may bring forth the fruits of good actions.</p>
      <p> " Article XII.â€”And this is the regeneration so highly celebrated in Scripture and denominated a new creation, a resurrection from the dead, a making alive, which God works in us without our aid. But this is nowise effected merely by the external preaching of the gospel, by moral suasion, or such a mode of operation that after God has performed His</p>
      <p> x</p>
      
      <p> part, it still remains in the power of man to be regenerated or not, to be converted or to continue unconverted; but it is evidently  A SUPERNATURAL WORK,  most powerful and at the same time most delightful, astonishing, mysterious, and ineffable; not inferior in efficacy to creation or the resur rection from the dead, as the Scripture, inspired by the author of this work, declares; so that all in whose hearts God works in this marvellous manner are, certainly, infallibly, and effectually regenerated, and do actually believe. Whereupon the will thus renewed is not only actuated and influenced by God, but in consequence of this influence becomes itself active. Wherefore, also, man is himself rightly said to believe and repent, by virtue of that grace received.</p>
      <p> â€¢ Article XIII.â€” THE MANNER OF THIS OPERATION  cannot be fully comprehended by believers in this life. Notwithstand ing which, they rest satisfied with knowing and experiencing that by this grace of God they are enabled to believe with the heart, and to love their Saviour.</p>
      <p> " Article XIV.â€”Faith is therefore to be considered as the gift of God, not on account of its being offered by God to man, to be accepted or rejected at his pleasure, but because it is in reality conferred, breathed, and infused into him; not even because God bestows the power or ability to believe, and then expects that man should by the exercise of his own free - will consent to the terms of salvation, and actually believe in Christ; but because He who works in man both to will and to do, and indeed all things in all,  PRODUCES BOTH</p>
      <p> THE WILL TO BELIEVE AND THE ACT OF BELIEVING also  (ct Vellc credere et ipsum credere)."</p>
      <p> Before leaving these erratic theories, let me briefly advert to Amyraldism, sometimes called hypothetic Universalism, which was in the last degree disastrous to French Pro testantism before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. I refer to it more especially because the phraseology which it introduced is still current in America, and is found in this</p>
      
      <p> country in quarters where we are surprised to find it. By those who were competent to take the measure of Aniy-raldism,â€”such as Eivetus, Maresius, and Spanheim,â€”it was regarded as a subtle form of Arminianism, though its author and his followers declared their harmony with the Articles of the Synod of Dort. After a long discussion of this middle way by one synod after another, in 1637 and 1645, Amy-raldus, by his protestations to the effect that he assented and consented to the Articles of Dort, succeeded in dis arming further opposition, and in obtaining an acquittal from the charge of heterodoxy in 1649. But it was the death - blow of French Protestantism. The majority of the theologians and pastors soon adopted his opinions. The French Protestant Church virtually ceased to be a witness for the doctrines of grace. A scholar of Amyraldus, Pajon, went farther than his master in minimizing the extent of natural corruption and the power of the Spirit in conversion. For the gracious operations of the Spirit, he, in fact, sub stituted  the moral influence of the word,  or moral suasion. After this, it was rather the Jansenists than the Protestants in France that gave any testimony to the doctrines of special grace.</p>
      <p> A few years later a terrible storm of persecution broke out, and scattered the French Protestants over the globe. It is not for us to call this a divine retribution, or a visitation in wrath. But few will deny that a deep declension had begun, or hesitate to affirm that the salt was beginning to lose its savour. Of those refugees who were scattered in all direc tions, no fewer than  TWO HUNDRED PASTORS  repaired to Holland, and were received with deep sympathy, and yet with clue caution. They were not to be received as pastors into the Walloon Church, unless they subscribed an article bind ing them to accept the Articles of Dort, and never to refer in public or in private to those Amyraldist and Pajonian doctrines which Spanheim, Jurieu, Saurin, and others re-</p>
      
      <p> garded ns an Arminian leaven \vliich had destroyed the French Protestant Church. These pastors consented to subscribe that article, and the Church was thus freed from the evil leaven by which it was menaced.</p>
      <p> As to the distinction Amyraldus drew between  NATURAL AND MORAL ABILITY,  still repeated both here and in America, and to which men so distinguished as Edwards, Bellamy, and Fuller gave a too ready ear, let me quote the following pointed and valuable remarks of Leidekker. " The learned Amyraldus," says Leidekker, " did no service to the cause of the Reformation by his distinction between  A PHYSICAL AND MORAL POWER OF BELIEVING IN CHRIST.  He supposed the sinner to have the former, but not the latter. He held that Christ died for all men according to a decree of God, by which salvation was secured to sinners on condition of faith; which general decree, according to him, was to be considered as going 1 Before the particular decree about giving faith to the elect. When it was mentioned to him that his notion of the general decree now mentioned was absurd, as it suspended the end of Christ's death on an impossible condition, he denied that the condition was impossible. '  For,'  said he, '  though I do not, with the Armenians, deny the indolence of fallen man, or his inability to believe (I allow him to be morally impotent}, yd I hold that man has still a  physical  or natural power of believing, as he jwsscsses the natural faculties of the understand ing and the v'ilV.</p>
      <p> "  Herein Amyraldus has given a sad example of the abuse of great parts. Shall we suppose that when Christ under took for sinners in the covenant of grace, He considered them any otherwise than as most miserable, lost, dead in sin, utterly impotent (Rom. v. 7, viii. 3); or that the wisdom of God gave Christ to die for this end, that sinners might attain salvation by a natural power of believingâ€”a power which Amyraldus confesses could never be exerted ? Further,</p>
      
      <p> is not faith a most holy and moral act, and, as it takes place in the sinner, purely supernatural act ? And shall we allow that a principle which is not moral, but merely physical, can be productive of such a moral and supernatural act ? Ought not an act and its principle to correspond with one another ? Let the same thing be said of love which Amyraldus has said of faith, and the Pelagians will triumph, who used to speak so much about a natural faculty of loving God above all things. Indeed, upon this scheme there will be no keeping out of the Pelagian opinion about the powers of  pure nature,  and about  physical or natural faculties in man of doing what is morally good.  For, in confuting that opinion, our divines still maintained that the image of God was requisite in the first man, in order to his exerting such morally good acts as those of loving and seeking true blessedness in the enjoyment of Him. But Amyraldus overthrows this doctrine, while he is led, by the distinction he makes between natural and moral power, to hold that the conception of man's rational nature necessarily includes in it a power of exerting acts morally good, such as those of desiring and endeavouring to obtain the restoration of communion with the infinitely holy and blessed God. The tendency of this scheme became more manifest when Pajoniusâ€”a disciple of Amyraldusâ€”began to deny the necessity of the Spirit's work  in the internal illumina tion of sinners, in order to their saving conversion. For, said Pajonius, nothing more is necessary to that end than that the understanding which has in itself a sufficiency of clear ideas (according to the language of the Cartesian philosophy then in vogue) should only be struck by the light of external revela tion, as the eye is struck by the rays of light coming from a luminous object."  ]</p>

      <p> 326   THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> succession of advancing and receding tides. We may accord ingly regard those three erratic tendencies last mentioned as</p>
      <p> o */         o</p>
      <p> the ebb-tide, after the flow of the Reformation period. Ere long, however, there appeared again clear indications of an advancing tide of spiritual influences, accompanied, as was to be anticipated, with a new testimony to the personality and operations of the Holy Spirit. To these we shall briefly advert.</p>
      <p> I shall notice first in order  THE PURITAN PERIOD,  which, to a large extent, may be described as taking form doctrinally in antagonism to the Arminian teaching and to the Romish practices introduced and encouraged in the English Church by the influence of Archbishop Laud. The testimony to the doctrines of grace, on the part of the Puritans, was accom panied with a signal effusion of the Holy Spirit. For the manner in which they brought out the doctrine of the Spirit's operations as contrasted with the Arminian teaching, which either did not recognise His agency, or confined it to the incipient impulse given at the time of baptism, they deserve the profound gratitude of subsequent ages. Whether we con verse on this point with  HOWE,  whose platonic mind, under the clear doctrine which he held and taught on the subject of the Spirit, soared to the contemplation of the beatific vision ; or with  OWEN,  whose study of the doctrine of the Spirit prompted him to unfold the spiritual mind and the glory of Christ; or with T.  GOODWIN,  whose researches into the Spirit's operations filled him with an enraptured love of knowledge, and a singular appreciation of the least particle of that word which embodies the Spirit's revelation,â€”we find nothing in their spirituality false or unhealthy. Their doctrine of the Spirit was used to lead men to Christ, not to withdraw men's minds from Him.</p>
      <p> These great divines, following in the same path with their predecessors Perkins, Preston, Bolton, and others, made it their task to prove that the Spirit's work is so essential in every system of theology and of ecclesiastical life, that without</p>
      
      <p> it all falls under the law of a perilous extemalism; that the regeneration of the nature is not less important than the justification of the person; and that the Spirit's work is not to be represented as merely coeval and identical with the rite of baptism. The latter point, taking the Spirit's operations away from the mere observances of Ritualism, was one service among many which Puritan theology rendered to evangelical truth.</p>
      <p> In this period the Christian consciousness and the Church consciousness in reference to the Spirit's operations were most definite and clear. It was a period also of great local awaken ings, when villages and towns were simultaneously brought under deep religious impressions, and which were always attended with a full belief of the Spirit's personality and work. Marked revivals took place in Scotland under the earnest preaching of Welsh, Bruce, Livingstone, Dickson, Rutherford,  and Blair, sometimes simultaneously, at other times more gradually. Similar effects in England accom panied the preaching of Rogers, Blakerby, Baxter, and others of that galaxy of remarkable men who lived and laboured to advance the cause of true religion. And the result was- the introduction of a new phase of theology in delineating the order of salvationâ€” a theology of regeneration cultivated and expanded as a topic l&gt;y itself.  The ample consideration of this theme by all the Puritans, such as  CHARNOCK, OWEN, HOWE, convey a clear proof that a new point of view had been attained. What the previous theologians had developed was by no means repudiated or undervalued, but only supple mented. The great theologians both of the Lutheran and Reformed Church developed the order of salvation as far as the Spirit operates, in order to justification. Now we hear more of regeneration, illumination, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p> The first generation developed in due proportion Christ  FOR  us and Christ  IN  us.   And this was the school which of all others</p>
      
      <p> gave the fullest and most emphatic description of the Spirit's work. Of the Puritan theology it was the prominent peculiarity to bring out  the distinction between nature and grace,  and to enforce the new birth irrespective of the theory which identifies it with baptism. To one fact all history gives a harmonious testimony. In the ratio in which the ritualistic element ascends, the spiritual element descends ; the elevation of the one being the depression of the other. And on the full persuasion of this the Puritans acted through all their history.</p>
      <p> But they had difficulties of another kind to encounter from the extreme opinions, nay, wild extravagances, to which sects and parties pushed the very doctrine of the Spirit for which they testified. It seemed as if an enemy had done this to discredit and discountenance the great doctrine to which they gave prominence. There seemed for a time a wild war of errors contending for the mastery. There was not only the naturalism of the Arminian system, but a congeries of other errors. The Quakers abandoned the sacraments altogether, and well-nigh lost sight of the objective Christ in an all-absorbing subjectivity.</p>
      <p> To the various classes of these enthusiasts, and to their names, it is not necessary more particularly to refer. Their great error was  to substitute the Spirit for the word,  the mischievous results of which all epochs attest. They set forth that though it was not absolutely useless to peruse the Scriptures, the mere knowledge of the latter was wholly unavailing, and could not promote the soul's salvation; that the man must learn from the Lord Himself, and be immediately instructed by the Spirit. The arrogance and presumption of such a claim was at once apparent. Though these enthusiasts had little if any learning, and a small and very inadequate acquaintance with any of the Christian doctrines by instruction from others or personal study, they claimed to be better informed than the greatest theologians who had spent their life in the humble and prayerful study of Christian truth</p>
      
      <p> with all the available aids of learning. It was alleged, how ever, that these last were but letter-learned men, untaught by the Holy Spirit. They proclaimed that the divine light, kindled in men by an immediate operation of God's Spirit, taught them what was needed for salvation ; that more or less of Bible knowledge was of small moment, and that man had, by sin, entirely forfeited anything like a salutary use of reason. They claimed  spiritual illumination apart from the Scriptures;  and they both taught and acted on the principle that they were to act as the Spirit moved them. There were Antinomian  enthusiasts professing to be mechanically acted on by the Spirit. Eutherford, who has fully described them in his " Spiritual Antichrist," was a contemporary and a true witness of what he read and saw.</p>
      <p> It was to defend truth thus imperilled, and to correct ex travagant opinions which repelled many arid drove them into antagonism to the whole subject, that Owen prepared his masterly work on the Holy Spirit. It has long been regarded, and justly, as the most important work on the Spirit in any literature. Without undertaking an analysis of this great work, let me simply quote what he says on the direct action of the Spirit on the human mind. He says: " God works immediately by His Spirit in and on the wills of His saintsâ€”that is, He puts forth a real physical* power that is not contained in these exhortations, though He doth it by and with them." And again, in reference to God's applications to the soul, they are, he says, " both really and physically efficient and moral also; the one consisting in the efficacy of His Spirit, the other lying in the exhortations of the word."</p>
      <p> The Puritan movement, like other forms of spiritual life, sprung from a historical necessity, and continued to exert its energies on the foundation of the Reformation theology. And in their eager desire to glorify their Lord, and to display the full doctrine of the Holy Spirit, these men were scarcely</p>
      <p> 1  It is better to say, "analogous to what is physical" (analoga physicse).</p>
      
      <p> conscious of that original development that they were step Ly step producing.</p>
      <p> Were we to review critically the Puritan school of theology, which is not the present object, we should be disposed to say that it scarcely preserved through all its history, especially in the third generation, the equipoise of truth for which it was at first distinguished. It must be admitted, that while it never failed to give a full testimony to the person and opera tions of the Holy Spirit, it sometimes forgot that the great aim and scope of the Spirit, as the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus, is to glorify Christ; that it occasionally gave greater emphasis to the work of the Spirit within than to the work of Christ without; that it frequently gave more prominence to faith as a grace of the Spirit than to faith as the receptive action  (actio  receptiva)  or uniting bond to Christ as the Lord our righteousness. The most salutary development is where the one does not eclipse the other.</p>
      <p> The Puritanic age may be said to have reached its culmi nating point, in a theological point of view, in producing those writings to which it gave origin on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and which depict the Christian as a new creature in Christ Jesusâ€”a distinct existence, but never separated from the living Head. The writings of Sibbs, Gurnall, Howe, and Goodwin contain a happy delineation of the Spirit's work on the individual as well as on the Church at large, though in proportion they say less than was to have been expected on the personality and mission of the Comforter. The English Nonconformists, the successors of the Puritans, continued for a century and a half to be the great bulwarks and defenders of the doctrine of the Spirit, and it will be an evil day for England and for themselves if, under the spell of an undue partiality for German thought, they should ever cease to regard this doctrine of the Spirit, and the spiritual religion to which right views of the Spirit can alone direct men's minds, as their badge of distinction and their glory. The</p>
      
      <p> work of  HUKRION,  though a posthumous publication and never completed, may be described as a work of great value so far as it goes. The same thing may be said of the work of Dr. Guyse on the Godhead of the Spirit. They furnish two of the best specimens which our tongue possesses of the way in which the elements of truth which the ancient Church developed may be recast and blended or interwoven with the more evangelical views of Protestant doctrine. The peculiar cast of Hurrion's work, replete with references to the Greek Fathers, warrants us in saying that those writers are greatly mistaken who are disposed to affirm, as Tholuck did, 1  that on the doctrine of the Spirit the contributions of the early centuries are either barren of results or of little avail to the Church of our time.</p>
      <p> The great writers of the English Church subsequently to the Restoration and the Eevolution, such as Taylor, Barrow, Tillotson, Sherlock, South, have done less for this department of theology than for any other. The personality and deity of the Spirit have nowhere found more able and strenuous as well as erudite defenders. But on the Spirit's work they were not themselves, except Pearson and Leighton. They were in part repelled by the extravagances into which the Commonwealth sects fell. But another cause is to be found in the Arminian theology, and in the theory of baptismal regeneration to which they were wedded, and through which they, for the most part, considered the subject.</p>
      <p> How eminent divines, in the course of another generation, treated the doctrine of the Spirit in the Church of England, appears from the work of the well-known Bishop Warburton, entitled  The Doctrine of Grace, or the Office, and Operations of the Holy Spirit.  The able writer, in fact, does not treat of grace at all in any acceptation of the term. He has not in his thoughts the operations of the Holy Spirit, which are com monly called the grace by which men are converted or called</p>
      <p> 1   Anzeiger,  1848, p. 571.</p>
      
      <p> to faith and holiness. With him there is no work of the Spirit in that sense, though he says that he will point out the middle way between unbelief and enthusiasmâ€”between such as assert that no divine operation is necessary to improve man's understanding and heart, and such as boast of the personal experience of the supernatural operations of the Spirit. One expects to find that this outline will have its application to individuals in the present day, and is surprised to find that his words refer only to the extraordinary opera tions of the Spirit in the age of the apostles, and to the fact that these operations ceased with the apostles. No believer in Revelation will dispute his statements so far as he brings out in that connection the fact of the extraordinary operations of the Spirit. The book, however, would have corresponded with its title had he used the term  GRACE  as descriptive of the Spirit's operations on every true Christian. But no one in any school of theology has been in the habit of using the term  GRACE  with the special acceptation to which he limits it. In a word, according to "Warburton, the Spirit's office and operations were limited to the extraordinary gifts and super natural guidance which those enjoyed who were made the chosen vessels of inspiration. He lays down as his funda mental position, that Christ's redemption could not otherwise be communicated to men; that God sent His Spirit to enlighten their understandings and sanctify their hearts; and that the wisdom of God appeared in the method which He condescended to employ at Pentecost in the communication of the Spirit of truth. The whole discussion is occupied with the great work of the Spirit in the inspiration of the apostles. And anything further is set down to a presumptuous and enthusiastic pretension on the part of men who cannot justify their claim, and who are only deceivers or deceived. Hence the unwarrantable violence of his denunciations of Wesley. Any claim to have the Spirit, or to be guided by the Spirit, was repudiated by Warburton as a claim to inspiration.</p>
      
      <p> Before we take up the next great controversy on the doctrine of the Spirit, it is proper to notice two currents of evangelical truth and spiritual life, the result of a new out pouring of the Holy Spirit. These were the important move ment in Germany under Spener and his followers, and the great awakening which took place in this country and America in connection with Whitefield, Wesley, and Edwards. A brief allusion to these important epochs must suffice, as our object in this sketch is rather to trace the history of the doctrine of the Spirit, than to describe the reformations or revivals which His presence and operations have produced in the Churches.</p>
      <p> Spener, in Germany, imbibing the spirit of Arnd, though a Lutheran and faithful to his Church, yet on friendly terms with many of the Reformed ministers, and appreciating true piety wherever he found it, began a movement in many re spects analogous to the Puritan movement, though with com-plexional peculiarities which adapted it to his own land. His aim was the revival of spiritual life in the Lutheran Church, stiffened and ossified by forms; and an extraordinary blessing from on high, or a fresh outpouring of the Spirit for at least two generations, crowned the movement. In Spener's teach ing, in his lectures on Arnd's true Christianity, in his sermons on regeneration, and, indeed, in all his writings as well as in the  Collegia pietatis  which he formed, his great aim was, while ardently testifying for all the doctrines of the Eeformation, to fan the spiritual life by a constant reference to the Holy Spirit. The previous theology represented by Melanchthon, Chemnitz, Gerhard, and others, had spoken of the Spirit's work in the order of salvation. Spener's constant reference to the Holy Spirit's operations introduced into theology a new set of terms. The operations of the Spirit came to be reduced under different heads, or classified in a new way. And the theologians, who had spoken in a vague, general way on the work of the Spirit in the order of salvation, were under the</p>
      
      <p> necessity of explaining themselves in reference to the Holy Spirit as a topic which now required to be treated indepen dently, and in reference to Biblical terms such as calling, conversion, repentance, illumination, regeneration, renewing, holiness, which could no longer be fused together as having no distinct or separate significance, and as all meaning one and the same thing. The union to Christ, effected by the Spirit and the personal inhabitation of the Spirit, had to be treated in a different way.</p>
      <p> The movement begun by Spener subsided in the third generation. An opposite current set in, and the spiritual decline was indicated by the question which carne to be dis cussed, \vhether any supernatural influence was at work in conversion, or whether all was effected by the moral power of the word. Schubert of Helmstadt resuscitated Pajonism, which called forth the keen opposition of Bertling in 1753. A more formidable work appeared from the pen of  JUNCKHEIM in 1775, on the supernatural in the operations of grace, which, from the reception it met with, and especially from the commendation bestowed on it by such a man as Ernesti, may be said to have given rise to a set of opinions from which Germany has never recovered. He asserted that the operation of God in men's regeneration and conversion was not to be designated supernatural, or, if that style of language was still retained, only in so far as the Scriptures were of supernatural origin. For the rest, there was nothing that was not wholly natural. The moral power of the word effected all. This was an erratic tendency which, though it called forth less alarm than Pelagianism, or Synergism, or Arminianism, was as perilous as any of them, and proved, perhaps, more calamitous. It was a theory that recognised the Scriptures, but left the Spirit nothing further to do. The propounder of this theory did not perceive that without an inward supernatural work of grace, admitted and believed, men will not long believe in an external supernatural revelation. More than that: if the Spirit</p>
      
      <p> does nothing on the individual, His personality will not long be believed in any proper sense of the term. And both results necessarily followed, in due course, in the religious history of Germany.</p>
      <p> Junckheim's position was, that if the operations of grace in man's soul were supernatural, conversion, faith, and holiness would be purely  MIRACULOUS WORKS,  and the operations of God would be irresistible. He accordingly adjusted his views to avoid these consequences, and held that the preacher must inculcate on his hearers that there are  no immediate operations of the Spirit. He argued, with no small ingenuity and force, that the operations of the Spirit and their effects are not miraculous works, though some divines have called them so; and all that is supernatural in these effects, said he, has one mark or criterion which no enthusiast can turn to account. It consists in this, that they are mediate, and produced by the divine word in a manner conformable to our moral nature; whereas the enthusiast claims immediate revelations based on feeling. He held that the operations of grace do not alter man's nature, and that they take a natural course; that there are no mysteries connected with them, and no influences of a supernatural power which put the human machine in motion. And this he attempts to harmonize with the Lutheran position that the man is passive in conversion.</p>
      <p> In a word, the writer, apparently ignorant of the inward experience of these gracious operations of which he ventured to treat, explains away the Spirit's operations or denies them. He concludes that these effects are not to be sought in a mode of operation on the heart, but in the means, that is, in the word of God, of which the effect is far greater than anything effected by reason or philosophy. But plainly he reduces the word of God, acting merely in a moral way, to a philosophy.</p>
      <p> Junckheim had nothing in common with those who affirm that the Holy Spirit immediately operates on the mind as well as the word. And he took up antagonistical ground to the</p>
      
      <p> Spirit's immediate operations, because he perceived that this would imply that these operations are irresistible. And he persuaded himself that this could not be proved from Scripture.</p>
      <p> Having established, to his own satisfaction, that the Spirit's mode of operation is not supernatural, he next inquires, How does man resist grace ?    This is done, says he, when he sup presses  good thoughts and feelings, and neglects to make a right use of them.    But he further asks, Is not man, by a right use of them, a co-operating factor in conversion ?     And he answers no: as little as a patient heals himself by following the physician's prescription.     The physician and the medicine healed him.     And   when  he  comes   to  speak   of  religious feelings, he regards all these feelings as something supernatural, in as far as they have their ground in the word of God, but not in respect of their origin; for they do not, according to him, flow from any immediate operation of the Holy Spirit, but from a comparison of their heart and life with that which the Holy Spirit, in His word, ascribes to the children of God. With regard to the difference of nature and grace, to the exaggerated statement of which Junckheim and others traced, as they thought, many evil consequences, one is not a little startled with his conclusion.    He says that this has always been an apple of discord, and therefore he wishes the term GRACE to be entirely omitted in dogmatic lectures, and not to remain in sermons where the hearers are still less in a position to form definite conceptions.    No marvel that he wished the term abandoned, because he had refined away or philosophized away the thing which it expressed.     He does not understand by it the supernatural operations of the Holy Spirit, by which fallen men are enlightened, converted, and sanctified.    But the title of his own book, " On the Supernatural in the Operations of Grace," is, from his own explanations, a very inept and unmeaning, if not a deceptive, title.</p>
      <p> After having explained away the true import of Scripture,</p>
      
      <p> we are not surprised to find that he attempts to make the symbolic books of the Lutheran Church speak in harmony with his views. Because these symbolic books affirm that the Spirit operates in us only by the word, he argues that this intimates that the operation is not immediate, not irresistible, but moral only, and according to our moral nature. According to Junckheim, prevenient grace amounts to this, that a man cannot prevent the good ideas, thoughts, and sentiments made by the word of God on the hearer or reader, just as it is impossible for us to open our eyes and not see.</p>
      <p> The refutation of all this speculation is easy enough on Biblical ground. It is also contrary to the Church-conscious ness of the entire Christian world from the beginning. If there was no more power or influence than this put forth, the conclusion must be that man converts himself, and that the Spirit has ceased to act since the age of inspiration. No reason could exist which demanded the immediate presence of the Holy Ghost as a divine Person. Still less could we imagine any meaning or significance attaching to the exercise of prayer for the Holy Spirit. If we accepted the doctrine laid down by Junckheim, and commended by so many in Germany toward the close of last century, that there is nothing to impress or influence the human mind but the moral power exercised by the Scriptures, the inevitable consequence must be to injure faith and to destroy all theology. The mystery of divine power illuminating, renewing, sanctifying the human mind, is merged in a moral influence or logico-moral power which the mere force of motives calls forth from the mind itself. The spiritual union of the word and Spiritâ€”or of the word considered as " the sword of the Spirit"â€”ceases, and only a moral power remains. The ruin of theology must also ensue. It is too obvious to need any proof that, on this principle, all the great articles of Christianity connected with the application of redemptionâ€”calling, conversion, illumination, renewing, re generation, and sanctification of the Spiritâ€”must either be</p>
      <p> Y</p>
      
      <p> rejected or recast. The Church, believing in the Holy Ghost, into whom every Christian is baptized, as well as into the Father and the Son, has always maintained that there is an omnipotent power of the Spirit exercised on every individual believer, as well as a mere logico-moral influence exercised by the word.</p>
      <p> This theory of Junckheim was the fatal blow from which, to this hour, German Protestantism has never recovered. It lias in it almost every unsalutary element that distinguished Pajonism in the Reformed French Church. And to me it has always seemed that it produced the same calamitous issues in the German Churches which Pajonism produced in the French Protestant Church previous to the revocation of the Edict of Xantes. It combined Pelagianism, Armiuianism, Amyraldism, and a sort of Naturalism all in one.</p>
      <p> It w r as well refuted by admirable men, but the current, of which it was but the indication, was too strong and too wide for any refutation to produce much effect. The excellent Lutheran theologian, Storr, refuted the work on Biblical grounds in two valuable Latin discussions on the efficacy of the Holy Spirit. 1  He had a comparatively easy task. His exegesis of the Scripture passages bearing on the subject under discussion was profound and conclusive, and no one can peruse them without feeling that he has scattered to the w r inds the special pleading of Junckheim in favour of a theory which is so far from being based on Scripture that it can only be regarded as a foregone conclusion. Tittmann did the same in his  Opuscule?  Wernsdorf, in his Academic Disputations, most successfully asserted the true principles of the Lutheran Church on the Spirit's work. And Eeinhard, in his  System of Christian Morals?  maintained the efficacious operations of the Spirit in the happiest manner and style. But it was too late.</p>

      <p> The theological revolution was effected: the receding tide since Spener's day continued. Michaelis, Doderleiu, and, above all, Ernesti, 1  the great name in German exegesis, and the masterly writer on hermeneutics, by his laudatory notice, gave Junckheim's work a passport to acceptance in the universities of Germany and among the pastors. German Protestantism had only one step to take further, viz. Rationalism.</p>
      <p> The next great fact connected with the doctrine of the Spirit, is  THE AWAKENING IN GREAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA  in the middle of last century, and the theological development resulting from it. It was undoubtedly the greatest stream of divine life since the days of the Eeformation, and imparted mainly to the English-speaking Churches. It was an outpouring of the Spirit so powerful in its character and so fruitful of con sequences, that we are warranted to say it has by no means spent its force, and it deserves a passing remark, though we are mainly occupied in tracing the history of the doctrine. The first movement goes back to Boston and the Marrow men, the revivers of true doctrine. Edwards and the Tennents in America, Whitefield and Wesley in England, Eobe, M'Culloch, Maclaurin, and Gillies in the Established Church of Scotland, Walker of Truro, Henry Venn, Berridge, Romaine, Newton, and Robinson in the Church of England, with others outside these Churches who zealously preached the same doctrines of grace, may be named as instruments with whom this great movement was identified, and who were raised up to act a part in it. In the second stage we find Rowland Hill, the Haldanes, Simeon, and others at work in different ways. The progress of Christianity, and of this great movement in parti cular, cannot be viewed as the effect of natural development without any intervention from above. None of the theories which shut out the action of the Church's life-communicating Head can explain this great tide of spiritual influence which 1   Neueste T/teologische B'Miothek,  1776.</p>
      
      <p> put a new aspect on theology and Church life. The theory of natural development, the theory of sacramental grace, not to mention the Romish notion of a vicegerent, all fail to explain such a fresh and powerful current of spiritual life; for they proceed on the principle that Christianity has no present corresponding to its past in apostolic times. They ignore the fact that the Holy Spirit acts with omnipotent and omnipresent energy as the Comforter, Helper, or Advocate whom the Lord promised at His departure, and who frequently descends with an efficacy analogous to the Pentecostal out pouring from above to quicken and inflame, to reanimate and restore, in a word, to make all things new. The facts con nected with the founding of the Church at Pentecost explode the theory of development so current in various forms in all ritualistic and sacramental Churches. These awakenings also attest the presence of the Spirit and the interposition of the Church's Head. They come in seasonably to give a practical refutation of the theology of development, though they are beyond our investigation. They are not in our power: nor will they come forth when we attempt to conjure them ; and we can only say, " It is the Lord " (John xxi. 7). While it is Christ's Spirit who ushers in these creative epochs in Church history, and while they indicate His hand who guides His Church onward to her future, they are altogether free and sovereign. We can neither tell the economy of them, nor explain why they pause. We come in only as gleaners on the field of fact, but can neither tell the laws nor estimate the momentum of that mighty and chainless force which breaks forth from the kingdom of God and sweeps over a community. Such a power at that time issued forth which could neither have been divined by human wisdom nor brought about by human power, and spread over America, England, and Scot land. At the time to which we have referred, there was a resuscitation of a Church-consciousness on the subject of the Holy Spirit such as had not been known from the days of the</p>
      
      <p> Keformation. It was in a large degree a restoration also of Puritan theology, though Wesleyanism attached itself to a type of theology which was more allied to Lutheranism than to the articles of the Church of England from which it sprung. But of that revival moment which gladdened the English-speaking Churches of last century, we may say that it was above all things Biblical; that it was not a mere revival of ancient forms, measures, and engagements; that it was not, like Jansenism, a mere resuscitation of Augustiniauism, valu able as that was, but a return to the Bible, which gave it an elevation, energy, and success which it could not otherwise have had.</p>
      <p> The effect of this memorable outpouring of the Holy Spirit was very perceptible on all the Churches. The Calvinistic Methodists, the Wesleyan Methodists, and the Welsh Metho dists were the direct and immediate fruit of it. Not less marked was the effect on the doctrine as well as the ecclesias tical and missionary life of the Church of England, though not diffused through the entire mass. The  two Homilies  on the coming down of the Holy Ghost acquired a new signifi cance. The prayers, replete as they are with allusions to the Spirit's work and mission, were offered with new fervour. One author treated the subject of the Spirit after another, free from the misty notions of sacramental grace and the blighting Arminian views which may be traced in all the previous period. The exposition of the subject by Henry Venn in his Complete Duty of Man,  by Robinson of Leicester in his  Chris tian System, 1   by Eomaine in his remarkable discourse on the Holy Spirit, leave nothing to be desired. For amplitude of statement and unembarrassed freeness of doctrinal view, they show how great a change had taken place. Courses of lectures on the Spirit were prepared and delivered. Prayers were offered for the Holy Spirit. Haldane Stuart of Liverpool sent out a yearly invitation to pray for the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 1  See Robinson's  Christian System,  vol. ii.</p>
      
      <p> Of this revival the great theologian was President Edwards, whose influence, as a thinker and leader of revival, has ever since been powerfully felt. No man can dispute his claim to a place among the acknowledged magnates of theology, whether we consider his profound exposition of the high doctrines of sovereign grace, or his view of the Religious Affections, in which he states his doctrine of the Spirit, or his almost unparalleled logical power. Had the theological reading of Edwards and his acquaintance with the productions of previous theological schools been in any proportion to his spiritual experience and mental powers, he would have taken his place along with Augustin, Anselm, Calvin, and Owen as one of the greatest formers of thought for all time. But from lack of acquaintance with the theological thought and style of the previous ages of the Church, he does not always lay down his premises or first principles with sufficient breadth and caution. Thus he powerfully describes the supernatural light immediately imparted to the soul by the Spirit of God as giving a sense of divine things in their reality and superlative excellency. But it is too one-sided for a high Calvinist, as Edwards undoubtedly was. His distinction between  NATURAL and  MORAL ABILITY,  in which he has been largely followed by American and English writers, was a capital mistake. Had Edwards fully known the place which that mischievous theory occupied in the Amyraldist system, it would probably never have been propounded in the manner in which it is set forth by him in his essay on the freedom of the will and elsewhere. For all the practical ends for which he appeals to it, it is safe enough ; when it is used speculatively, it is dangerous. It was adopted in America by Bellamy, Dwight, Woods, and by the revivalists as a body. It was accepted here by Dr. Erskine, by Fuller, Ryland, Hinton, Dr. Pye Smith in England. Pro ceeding in that line of tilings, these writers thought they had gained a vantage-ground. They argued that the previous mode of representing the matter by the followers of Augustin</p>
      
      <p> and Calvin, left the idea of a real incapacity or natural inability; that it was chargeable with an improper application of Scripture figures (Eph. ii. 1; Ezek. xxxvii.); that they gave a needless point of attack to Pelagians; and 'that men might reasonably say that they were not responsible for not per forming what was really not in his power. To obviate this, the assertors of the above-named distinction said, The proper language to be used was simply that men  vjould not,  not that they  could not,  repent and believe the gospel. They wished to exhibit that the entire turning-point was with the will, and they threw the responsibility on the man to make him feel that he would not come and be saved.</p>
      <p> These expositions of inability, resolving the whole matter into an act of will, served no good purpose or end. They were not in harmony with Scripture nor with the doctrines of the Reformation, either in the Lutheran or Reformed Church. They were an attempt in words at least to do something, or at least seem to do something, to obviate the common objec tion of the Semi-Pelagians:  ''  A man cannot be under an obligation beyond his ability; he cannot be bound to do what is not within his own power and resources." The answer to that objection, as given by Marckius and by all the divines of the post-Reformation period, was, that while God did not require of man in innocence anything for which he had not ability, yet God did not lose His right to demand obedience though man has forfeited his power or ability. This answer was held to be sufficient; and it is recognised by all who have right views either of the  IMPETRATION  or  APPLICATION OF REDEMPTION.  The writers to whom Edwards incautiously gave this new impulse supposed that a better answer could be given by drawing a distinction between natural and moral ability. They set forth that men, even as they now are, have a  natural power to believe in Christ and to repent, but that they are denuded of all  moral  power to do either. There is nothing more deceptive than the use of such nomenclature, which</p>
      
      <p> really amounts to nothing. It hides the true state of the question under cloudy terms. To show how unmeaning that distinction is, let me notice the following points:â€”(1) The inability, according to the express words of Scripture, must be traced to the understanding as well as to the will (1 Cor. ii. 14). To the natural man the things of the Spirit of God are foolishness, because he cannot know them, and because he misrepresents them. But to prove that no efforts of the natural man will avail to make a change, and that only the supernatural light imparted by the Spirit can suffice, the apostle says, " because they are spiritually discerned." (2) The inability, viewed, according to the Pauline statements, as enmity against God, as a non-subjection to the divine law, and as an incapacity for being so subject (Eom. viii. 7), may be called both  natural  and  moral.  That is, it is the loss of the image of God, or of the original righteousness which at first belonged to Him and was natural to Him. As man's entire nature is subject to this corruption to such a degree that he cannot think a good thought or perform a single good act without a change of nature, this inability may be called natural and culpable. The act of the will is not the only hindrance. There is the corruption of the nature and the want of supernatural grace. If it lay all in a want of will or inclination, the frequently repeated  cannot  of Scriptureâ€” e.y. cannot come, cannot please God, cannot bear fruit, and the likeâ€”would have no other significance than the disinclination of a man to do what he has within him full ability or power to do, if we were only induced to will it. There can be no greater misrepresentation or deception. (3) A common para logism is: " If a man cannot in a true manner repent and believe, then he cannot do the opposite, disbelieve and refuse salvation." But all unbelief and impenitence have their root in natural depravity, and grow from it. The inability to repent and believe presupposes a bias or tendency to the opposite sin, and makes it natural and easy to practise it;</p>
      
      <p> and they are left the more to shut their eyes and ears under a peculiar induration permitted to descend on them.</p>
      <p> All this serves to show how mistaken Edwards was in making that distinction, which is still drawn by many of his followers, between natural and moral ability. What was really aimed at was the conjunction of two things, neither of which must be permitted to eclipse the other, viz. free agency and inability, personal responsibility and the necessary helps or aids of God's Spirit. And the true object is gained, not by magnifying natural ability and shutting men up to will,  but by exhibiting the two sides of the incomprehensible mystery. They are both true; and all that theology effects, is to conserve the mystery.</p>
      <p> Again, we have to trace, as in previous epochs,  THE RE CEDING TIDE OF THE SPIRIT.  Before the great leaders of that revival had passed away, erratic views on the opera tions of the Spirit had begun to display themselves, the usual concomitants of declension. The first of these was Sandemaniauism, which we notice because its distinctive tenetâ€”the intellectual assent of faithâ€”was accepted by a large section of ministers in Scotland, and even by sijch a man as Dr. Erskine, and still holds its place. About twenty-five years after the formation of the Glasites in 1729, a dividing question was started by Sandeman on the subject of saving faith, which, according to him, was nothing but the faith of common lifeâ€” ASSENT TO TESTIMONY.  The letters on Theron and Aspasio, which he published in 1757, embodied a new system of doctrine. He allowed no work of the Spirit in the effectual application of redemption. He says excellent things on the irnpetration or purchase of redemption; but he repudiates all inward grace as counterfeit. Under the guise of magnifying the former, he vilifies the latter, and all who preached it, with the greatest contempt and scorn. He calls any allusion to it self-righteousness and pride. One can easily see, what he himself allows, that his mind had once been</p>
      
      <p> troubled with convictions and contrition, and that he had solved the matter in the wrong way. According to Sandernan, faith was a mere passiveness in coming under impressions, a passive belief of the truth without doing anything but appre hending the knowledge of what he often calls the bare truth, or Christ's bare work, without any act, exercise, or exertion of the mind whatsoever. And to leave no possible misconception as to what he meant, he says, " The Spirit of God acts AS the soul, sense, or meaning of the words wherein the gospel is delivered" (p. 360). After stating that much has been said and written in defence of supernatural grace, or the agency of the divine Spirit influencing the hearts of men, in opposition to those reasoners who doubt of or deny any such influence, and that many things have been said on this head, serving to give us false notions of the divine grace and Spirit, Sande-man subjoins, " The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of truth, as also the Spirit of grace. He speaks and breathes only the grace and truth that came by Jesus Christ. When a man then comes to know the gospel, or to receive the Spirit, he thinks of no other grace but what appeared in Christ's tasting death for them ; no other truth but what was manifest in Christ, the end of the law for righteousness. This differs not a little from what the popular doctrine leads us to think of, namely,  tJic truth of grace in the heart.  When our systems describe faith to us as a saving grace bestowed on us, by which we make use of Christ for salvation, are we not led to think of some grace necessary to our salvation beside what appeared when Christ by the grace of God tasted death for the sins of men ?"</p>
      <p> It is clear that the writer identified the influence of the truth and the influence of the Spirit, and that he intended to supersede every other grace than the objective grace displayed in the atonement. Still more unambiguously he says, " All the divine power which operates upon the minds of men, either to frive the first relief to their consciences or to influ-</p>
      
      <p> ence them in every part of their obedience to the gospel,  is persuasive power,  or the forcible conviction of truth." If all is persuasive power, and if the Holy Spirit acts  AS  the soul, sense, or meaning of the words, that is antagonistic to all that the apostle affirms when he says that the natural man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God, " because they are spiritually discerned." The Spirit gives all that discernment and conveys all that meaning. Fuller, the eminent Baptist minister, and Eev. D. Wilson, London, wrote admirably against Sandemanianism. Fuller's letters on this subject would have been more conclusive had he followed Sandeman step by step instead of turning aside to less able men.</p>
      <p> It remains to sketch the doctrine of the Holy Spirit during this nineteenth century. The revival of the British and Ameri can Churches may be regarded as the most obvious and signal work of the Spirit during last century, though many a similar outpouring of the Spirit has taken place since.  THE GREAT outstanding  WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT  in the present century is  THE SUCCESS IN MISSIONS.  But as our object is to trace the phases of doctrinal opinion more than Church life, I shall not turn aside from this.</p>
      <p> In all the theological thinking on the operations of the Spirit in this country and America, the powerful influence of President Edwards may easily be detected. Its most import ant element appears in the various writers who, like Dwight, Byland, and others, imbibed the views contained in the treatise on the Eeligious Affections. The more speculative point on the so-called natural ability, often carried to an un warrantable and dangerous extreme, was found in all the American revivalists till Dr. Hodge and the Princeton divines withstood it, and did much to counteract l   its spread.</p>
      <p> Here I may add that it was a wholly gratuitous collision into which Edwards' opinions were brought with the opinions of Marshall, Hervey, Boston, and the Marrow men, by a spirit</p>
      <p> 1  See the Princeton essays  On Human Inability.</p>
      
      <p> of controversy on the part of Bellamy. He represented some of the expressions of these eminent men in a wrong light, as if they did not hold the necessity of regeneration as antecedent to the first act of faith. It was a misrepresentation of these great men's opinions, who maintained in terms the most unambiguous, that  regeneration is not effected by the word without the Spirit, nor conversely by the Spirit without the word,  and that the Spirit of light and revelation in the knowledge of Christ is the source of all spiritual affections. But the aim of Marshall, and of the others named along with him, was to set forth the supernatural work of  regeneration as the first act of faith;'  in other words, to prove that a regenerate person is never for a moment in possession of regeneration without the exercise of saving faith on its object; that regeneration proceeds in order, but that the regenerate person is never destitute of saving faith on Christ. He held that the Spirit of God does  not work faith till ice act it.  He maintained, as strongly as Edwards did, that  the Spirit produces all and that ice act all,  but that there is no inoperative possession of faith as a grace of the Spirit without its active exercise on Christ as its proper object. And the design of so putting the matter was a practical one. He would have men begin the exercise of faith in compliance with the word of invitation, without waiting for the knowledge that the Spirit had already effected in them the saving change. A few further remarks ,will suffice for what remains to be said on the doctrine of the Spirit in connection with modern American theology. If we except the peculiar views of Finney and the revivalist school, whose tendency was to magnify human ability, and to keep the Holy Spirit and His operations out of view in all their preaching, there was little in the mode of presentation adopted either in the old or new school to which, when rightly explained, any Biblical divine could take just exception. There might be different modes of explaining the nature of regeneration. Some had their taste-theory.  D wight, for instance, following in the line</p>
      
      <p> of Edwards, made the change of heart consist in a relish for spiritual objects imparted by the Holy Spirit. Others ex plained the fact by a change of the ruling purpose or chief end. But these were only modes of exposition where the same truth was held.</p>
      <p> The main point of discussion between those who at bottom built on the same foundation was, whether the Holy Spirit acts on the mind  MEDIATELY  or  IMMEDIATELY.  But by both the agency of the Spirit was spoken of as preceding the action of the human mind in conversion, and as the cause of the change. The human mind was considered as only concurring with the divine Spirit in turning the man from the error of his ways. The old school laid emphasis on the fact that man is passive in regeneration and active in conversion. It was held that in what is properly the act of God the man cannot be said to be active, because he is but the party changed, or the object on whom the change is produced. As to the new school, it was sometimes alleged against it that the agency of the Holy Spirit was represented wholly as that of moral suasion. But they vehemently repelled this as an injustice.</p>
      <p> This whole question, whether the Spirit of God acts only by the intervention of the word, is often rendered ambiguous by the mode in which it is stated. The question of the  im mediate  or  mediate  operation by the Spirit is not whether God's word is used or not. Both intend to assert that the change is effected by the word, as the instrument in the hand of God or as the sword of the Spirit. The true mode of stating the question is whether the word produces the result by mere moral suasion, or by the Spirit's direct action in regenerating the mind.</p>
      <p> The full, well-balanced doctrine of the Spirit has long been maintained in England by the successors of the Puritans. They have handled it with an amplitude of view, a freshness of delineation, and a spiritual tone which leave nothing to desire. This is the eminent service rendered to Christianity by the English Nonconformists. Not to go back to the Baptists</p>
      
      <p> of former times, those eminent men who adorned their ranks at the beginning of this century, most of whom imbibed the views of Edwards in the best sense, set forth in a happy combination the operations of the Spirit with a full and free proclamation of the gospel. The circular letter of the eloquent Robert Hall gives an admirable exposition of the work of the Spirit and of the Church's duty; and the same thing is true of Fuller's circular letter; both prepared in order to diffuse right views on this momentous therne. The admirable work by Harrington Evans, entitled  The Spirit of Holiness,  is the work of one who outlived the blighting influence of Sabellianism, under which he fell for some time; and who, subsequently to his restoration, continued for many years to give a more emphatic testimony to the personality and work of the Spirit than any other man perhaps has done since the time of Owen. 1 The English Congregationalists during this century have produced several works of much value on the doctrine of the Spirit. The exposition of this topic by Williams in his  Equity and Sovereignty,  by Payne in his Lectures, by Wardlaw in several publications, and by Stowell in his admirable lectures on  The Work of the S^nrit,  forms a literature with which, for its deeply spiritual and experimental doctrine, every Biblical</p>
      <p> 1  Mr. Evans, having read some of those writings of Dr. Isaac Watts which have an all too obvious Sabcllian tendency, carne to deny the distinction of persons in the Trinity. He published his Sabellianism in a work entitled Dialogue* on Important Subjects,  in 1819. His history, in connection with this change of doctrinal opinion, is full of significance and warning. He had been an acceptable minister in the Church of England, and much blessed in his work. The spell of his new opinions so blinded his mind, that he did not for a time perceive all that was involved in it. As he did not deny the work of the Spirit upon the heart, he did not for a time suspect that the Holy Spirit was dishon oured. When he came to see that he denied the Deity of the Son and the real glory of the Holy Ghost in the economy of redemption, he wrote a refutation of his own work in  Letters to a Friend,  by J. H. Evans, 1826. He collected all the copies of his dialogues, and consigned them with every mark of contrition to the flames. The whole account given in the Memoir by his son is replete with interest. But the memorable fact is (p. 50) that his own soul suffered, and that there was a most manifest withering in his ministry. After his return to sound Trinitarian views, scarcely ever was there in London a more blessed ministry than his.</p>
      
      <p> divine must fully sympathize. This is their badge of distinction. The one exception to these important contributions is the work of Dr. Jenkyn on  The Influences of the Holy Spirit.  But as Dr. Payne has fully exposed and refuted that attempt to identify the Spirit and the word, and as it does not differ from the views of Pajoii and Junckheim, already explained, it is not necessary to occupy space in further refutation of that line of thought.</p>
      <p> The work of Stowell, bating some minor points to which we have already taken exception in this volume, is a broad and comprehensive description of some parts of the ministra tion of the Spirit. It is limited to the spiritual life. And its object, according to a plan formed during a pastoral ministry of thirty years, was to "show that neither Church traditions, philosophical theories, nor mystical imaginations, are in accord ance with what the Spirit of God has taught concerning His own work, but that Christian spiritualism is the harmony of divine revelation with the consciousness of man." Mr. Stowell begins with man rather than with the divine economy in the mission of the Holy Ghost, or with His personality and Deity. Nor could any objection against this method be sustained, if, in the subsequent parts of the volume, sufficient prominence had been given to the agent and His mission as well as to His work, which, however, we desiderate. After describing the wrong choice which is uniformly made, and which, as he happily shows, must be ascribed not so much to any other cause, as to an inward and spontaneous predisposition, he arrives at the conclusion that with man nothing becomes an actual motive, however clearly its truth may be perceived, however seriously its reason and right and authority may be responded to, until his spirit is changed; adding that either it must remain undone, or God must do it (p. 49).</p>
      <p> The valuable work of Dr. James Buchanan of a practical and devotional character, Hare's  Mission of the Comforter, Winslow's work on  The Spirit,  deserved the important place</p>
      
      <p> which they have occupied in public estimation. An anony mous work, entitled  The Comforter,  deserves also favourable notice.</p>
      <p> We have already referred to Dr. Wardlaw's services in con nection with the work of the Spirit. As Dr. Payne and Mr. Stowell refer to the correspondence carried on by Dr. Ward-law on the one side, and by the Congregationalist Churches, from whom he separated, on the other, it may serve, perhaps, better than any other historical facts that could be adduced, to refer to that discussion, because the important spiritual truth which he asserted in that controversy exhibited the true opinions of the Congregationalist body. In order to remain in Church fellowship with some of the neighbouring Churches, he demanded evidence that they believed in a  SPECIAL INFLU ENCE OF THE SPIRIT,  and not in a mere general influence given equally to those who believe the gospel and to those who reject it. He cut off all evasion from those who were ready to admit the influence of the Spirit in words and to deny it in fact. In taking this step, which we can only commend as a faithful act of discipline, Dr. Wardlaw declared that an agreement on the work of the Spirit in conversion was, by the body of which he was a minister, always held as equally essential with an agreement of sentiment regarding the work of Christ. And he adds that the doctrine of the special influ ence of the Spirit has been regarded as characteristic of that body in Scotland ever since its commencement (p. 83). The professed convert attributed his change of heart and the faith thence resulting to nothing in himself, but to the grace of the Spirit making him to differ from other men (p. 99).</p>
      <p> The great question discussed in that correspondence was whether they who are converted to God experience any  direct inward influence or operation of the Holy Spirit on their minds distinct from, but accompanying the word.  This is emphati cally affirmed by Wardlaw, and evaded but really denied by the other party, who regarded the influence of the truth and</p>
      
      <p> the influence of the Spirit as one and the same. What Dr. Wardlaw meant by the special influence of the Spirit was His operation  within  the mind and heart, accompanying the truth and rendering it efficacious; whereas they held no influence but that of the word, or external means (p. 124).</p>
      <p> As the parties attached to this modern Pajonism questioned or denied any direct internal working of the Spirit in con version, and said that the Spirit works only by His truth, His people, and Providence, the whole of their positions were fully exposed and sometimes refuted by a happy  reductio ad absurdum,  or by propounding a series of untenable supposi tions which, according to their premises, must needs be held. Thus Dr. Wardlaw arguesâ€”(1) The subject of conversion must be less opposed to God than others, if the opposite view has any validity. He must have a better disposition, and have whereof to glory contrary to Scripture (1 Cor. iv. 7); or (2) the word, or means, or instruments, must have more power at conversion than on any former occasion; and who does not see the absurdity of a fact or motive having more force one day than another, when, according to the supposition, it is all external ? But when we affirm the Biblical position, that the indisposition of the heart is removed by the new heart being given (Ezek. xxxvi. 26), no further difficulty remains. Dr. Wardlaw in the most cogent style of argument proves, in opposition to his opponents, that the gospel to which the heart is opposed can never change the heart  till that gospel is admitted,  and that it can never be received without the interference of a higher power (p. 140).</p>
      <p> The following words will suffice to show the manner in which he conjoins the two thingsâ€”the word and Spirit:â€”" To show the necessity of a direct divine agency of the Spirit in the soul of man,  accompanying the word as the instrumental means,  in order to account for its conversion would require a volume." " If the influence of the Spirit is merely the influence of the word, of evidence, and of circumstances</p>
      <p> z</p>
      
      <p> operating on the human mind independently of any efficacious, inward, illuminating, spiritualizing energy, then there is nothing supernatural in the caseâ€”nothing beyond or different from the ordinary phenomena of the mind as affected by informa tion with its attendant proofs, or whatever else may contribute to excite attention and command assent. You do no more than put the Spirit in the place of Providence, or of the human agent through whose instrumentality Providence works. The means are left to their own operation, there being no other influence accompanying or superadded" (p. 60). After adverting to the inadequate conceptions entertained as to the heart's alienation from God, and the historical fact that the denial of inward special efficacious grace to the conversion of sinners and the denial of the atonement have uniformly gone together, the correspondence goes over all the points in debate. It is one of the most valuable discussions polemically which has recently appeared on the Spirit's work, and brings up and exposes the present phase of Pajonism and Semi-Pelagianism. Dr. Wardlaw exposes the avowal that when a sinner believes he receives the Spirit! How comes the sinner to believe ? he exclaims; whence this spiritual perception ?</p>
      <p> Before passing from the Congregationalist writers, to whom we owe some of the best parts of our theological literature on the doctrine of the Spirit, it may not be out of place to refer to a tendency among them to explode the distinction usually made between the common and special operations of the Spirit. They seem drawn to this by considerations which, whether accepted or not, are entitled to respect. They wish apparently to prove, against Arminian opponents, that it is only in His testimony that the Spirit can be said to be resisted; that in His work, properly so called, the Spirit is irresistible, and that He who hath  begun a good work  will perform it till the day of Jesus Christ. Of course, if that distinction can be fully estab lished, the advantages connected with that mode of putting divine truth are obvious. However, I am merely stating</p>
      
      <p> here historically that this tendency is cropping out among their most eminent writers. Wardlaw plainly inclines to it in the above-named correspondence and in his system. Dr. Pye Smith thus asserts it in his  First Lines of Christian Theology (Schol. iii.): "On what is called by many  common grace  and its essential difference from that which is  saving ;  this is riot Scriptural phraseology, it is needless, and tending to embar rassment'' (p. 568). Dr. Payne in like manner says, "I do not believe that the influence of the Spirit of God, in the specific and proper sense of the term,  i.e.  an influence  distinct  from the moral or persuasive influence of divine truth, is ever exerted except upon those who were prepared unto glory."</p>
      <p> Only two additional phenomena in this country demand a passing notice, because they claim, in a peculiar sense, to owe their origin to the Holy Spiritâ€” IRVINGISM  and  PLYMOUTH BRETHRENISM.  They are so vastly inferior to their pretensions, however, that they rather awaken a feeling of regret and pity.</p>
      <p> As to  IRVINGISM,  with its ostentatious parade of supernatu ral gifts and of extraordinary offices, which have had no real existence since the apostolic age, it is after all smothered under ritualistic forms. Were there nothing more to prove its hollowness, this would suffice. Such a supply of the Spirit as this sect claims could not co-exist with its pomp of prepared liturgical and office-forms. It was largely a revival of Montanism ; and the way in which it committed itself to a revival of twelve apostles for the sealing of the apocalyptic twelve thousand immediately before the second advent (Rev. vii. 4), will prove its death-blow, which cannot long be delayed or warded off in the nature of things.</p>
      <p> As to  BRETHRENISM,  it will have a longer existence probably than the other phenomenon. It has produced a literature on the Holy Spirit of a very mixed character. Mr. Darby, Mr. Kelly, ard Mr. Harris have all written on the Holy Spirit. While many excellent things have been said by all these</p>
      
      <p> writers on the distinction which must always be carefully drawn between Christ's work  FOR  us and the Spirit's work  IN us, on the inhabitation of the Spirit in the hearts of Christians, and on the communion between Christ and His people by the Holy Ghost the Paraclete, there are three points where their doctrinal views on the Spirit are mischievous in the last degree. (1) They have very much resuscitated the Cocceian notions as to the alleged low platform of the Old Testament saints. They represent them all as burdened and fettered by the Spirit of bondage, till one hardly sees where spirituality remains. They thus come to divide the Church which was one from the days of Abel into two. (2) They make a presumptuous claim to be in their assemblies under the presidency of the Holy Ghost, as they phrase it; and, accord ingly, they venture to carry out the decrees and resolutions come to under this imagination with a confidence little less than apostolic. (3) They take exception to what most other Churches, not swamped by Ritualism, have always re garded as one of the most important and blessed dutiesâ€” to prayer for the Holy Ghost.  The Church of God of all ages, according to the most explicit Scripture examples,â€”the Greek Church, the Roman Church, all the Protestant Churches, in the exercise of a deep Christian instinct,â€”have invocated the Holy Ghost, and expected larger and larger supplies and com munications ; and they grieve for and confess their sin in not having more implored His help and presence. This sect, by an obvious misinterpretation of Scripture, objects to the practice of praying for the Spirit, because forsooth He was given at Pentecost.</p>
      <p> In winding up this historical survey, we have only to add an outline of the modern views on the doctrine of the Spirit which prevail in  GERMANY, HOLLAND,  and  SWITZERLAND. Germany seems to have abandoned this whole field, as if it were no longer worthy of cultivation. There is not a single work in the whole compass of German literature on the office</p>
      
      <p> and work of the Holy Spirit, if we except the unfinished work of Kahnis, 1  of any value or importance. And when we inquire into the reason, it is traceable partly to the dominant Sabel-lianism, partly to the utterly misplaced importance attached to the sacraments, and which has produced results scarcely less calamitous, notwithstanding the evangelical preaching which prevails in Germany, than the same error has caused in the Church of Eome. The Lutheran Church system is such that it does not require the Spirit's work for the application of redemption. What other Churches ascribe to the Holy Spirit, the Lutheran Church ascribes to the sacraments and Church ordinances; and these opinions are so diffused through the community, and so dominate the minds of clergy and laity alike, that there remains in reality in the ecclesiastical or theological mind no place for the operations of the Spirit on the individual. Regeneration is identified with baptism. Prayer for the Spirit is deemed superfluous, because the sacra ments are always equally replenished with blessings. A new supply or outpouring of the Spirit is, according to them, an English or American extravagance.</p>
