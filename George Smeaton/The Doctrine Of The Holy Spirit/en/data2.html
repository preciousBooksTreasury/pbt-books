      <p> The Biblical revelation, if capable of proof at all, can be established only as a historically guaranteed fact. All other modes of proof which have been made use of have already been found unserviceable. Thus the arguments drawn from the necessity of inspiration are of no weight, because the a priori  style of reasoning is carried into a sphere to which it cannot fitly be applied. Arguments of this sort, which can be set aside as nothing more than assumptions, are of little value. As nothing but divine testimony can assure us of a divine fact, we must, after being satisfied with the validity of the creden-</p>
      
      <p> tials, interrogate revelation itself. The authority of the Old Testament, confirmed by a vast array of miracles and by the evidence of accomplished prophecy, was accepted not only by the Old Testament Church, but by our Lord and His apostles, and passed over into the Christian Church with divine sanction before the ISTew Testament literature, properly so called, was prepared for the Church's use.</p>
      <p> As to the New Testament books, to which we shall now more specially refer, we may affirm that it is only on the authority and credibility of a divine teacher—the Messiah Himself—that the proof of the theopneustic character of the Xew Testament Scriptures rests. The Lord Jesus said it, and His guarantee or promise secured its historic certainty. He promised to the apostles, that for the delivery of the communi cations made to them by His oral teaching or subsequent revelations, they should be supernaturally guided by the Holy Ghost the Comforter. We conclude, accordingly, that they were so guided. The cogency of this deduction needs no con firmation. The theopneustic character of the apostles' instruc tion, whether historical or doctrinal, whether oral or written, belongs to a class of extraordinary or miraculous operations of the Holy Spirit. They belong to the invisible miracle, and Luthardt well observes: " He who says revelation says miracle, and miracles cannot be explained."</p>
      <p> From this it follows that we need make no attempt to prove the inspiration of apostles to a theological disputant who sees in Jesus only an ordinary human teacher, or one, like the old prophets, only under the general influence of the Holy Spirit. With such an opponent it is vain to debate on this subject; and this is the case with a considerable number of those who are opposed to supernatural or plenary inspira tion. They recognise in Jesus only a man of like passions with ourselves, on whom the Deity wrought, and in whom the Deity dwelt, in a peculiar way, by providences and influences of an exceptional character, but not the only-</p>
      
      <p> begotten Sun. But, on the contrary, he who acknowledges the Lord Jesus as Messiah, and as the Only-begotten of the Father, cannot for a moment entertain a doubt as to the truth of any of His promises or declarations. Hence the only point of which it is possible to make a question is— Whether the promise of the Spirit's inspiration was actually made, and whether He promised it in the sense which we have put upon His words.</p>
      <p> It is conceded that the proof of the promise as to the mission of the Comforter for imparting this theopneustic gift must be drawn from the recorded sayings of Christ in a few passages which we can analyse and examine (viz. Matt. x. 19 and Luke xii. 14; John xiv. 16, xv. 26, xvi. 7, 14). These passages — spoken by our Lord in immediate view of the commission which the apostles were to discharge, first within the cities of Israel, and next on a far more extended scale— contain express assurances that they should receive the Holy Ghost, and be qualified by the Holy Ghost in the exercise of a specially conferred gift, to discharge the duties of their mission in propagating or spreading the gospel among the nations; that they should receive from the Spirit of God a mouth and wisdom for the purpose of directing them when summoned before governors and kings l   now and  WHAT  they should speak on every occasion; that the Spirit should recall the words of Christ as they were originally spoken to their remembrance; that the Spirit should further instruct them on points which could not for the present be comprehended; and that the Comforter, as a peculiar teacher, should descend upon them, and equip them in such a way that they would be endued with power from on high.</p>
      <p> An objection has been made, indeed, to the employment of those passages as a proof of the theopneustic character of their writings, on the allegation that  the men  might have the Spirit, but that the tenor of the promise does not in so</p>
      <p> yy.fnri vu; ti  TI  &gt;aXr,ffr,r&lt;  (Matt.  X.  19).</p>
      
      <p> many words extend to  their writings,  which might be prepared like any other literary productions. The objection has been frequently repeated by one theological school after another. The passages, it is said, do not contain a word to prove that in the composition of their writings the apostles were favoured with any higher guidance of the Spirit. It is contended that the Lord merely names occasions when they might be sum moned unprepared, or under embarrassing circumstances, to give an oral statement of their beliefs and Messianic convic tions ; and hence it is alleged that this animating promise of the immediate operation of His Spirit and of His special guidance in arduous times might not extend to their written statements. Nay, it is argued by way of challenge : How can it be warrantable to hold that the promise extended to a wholly different case, of which at the time when the words were uttered the apostles could have no anticipation ?</p>
      <p> The objection now stated might have some appearance of plausibility if that was the only passage, and if there were no other passages descriptive of the extraordinary gift of inspira tion conferred on the apostles, except where the promise was in some sort limited. But that is not the case with the passages preserved to us by John, where Christ speaks with a certain indefinite generality. He promised that after His departure to the Father, they should enjoy the peculiar teaching and guidance of the Comforter, who should per manently abide with them, at once to teach them all things and lead them into all truth. We do not need "to prove again, that by the Holy Ghost the Comforter \ve are to under stand a divine instructor, helper, or patron who should not only qiialify them for their commission, but impart a full insight into Christ's religion. He was to come as a divine Person to impart a permanent theopneustic gift, which was to be exercised in every department of apostolic activity. They were to be under the constant influence and higher guidance of the Spirit for all official duty. "We are fully warranted to</p>
      
      <p> conclude that if Christ promised the immediate guidance of the Comforter as often as they were called, in their capacity of apostles, to give instruction in the facts and doctrines of His religion, He unquestionably comprehended within the scope of that promise the case of giving religious instruction through the medium of written documents addressed to the various Churches of the apostolic age and to the Church of all succeeding times. And  the apostles, in prefixing their name and office, to their various Epistles,  intimated this fact to them and to us. As the theopneustic gift was permanent, while they continued to discharge their functions, we must suppose them to have been as much under divine guidance in the com position of their writings as in their oral instruction. The validity of this inference cannot be denied or disputed.</p>
      <p> The opponents of Biblical revelation, accordingly, have recourse to another mode of assault. Some expressly deny that in the passages to which we appeal anything is promised even remotely approaching to the theopneustic gift. This is the favourite modern theory. It is maintained that nothing more is meant than the ordinary influence of grace, and that our Lord and His apostles never thought of a special higher power, or of  IMMEDIATE  divine inspiration imparted by the Comforter the Holy Ghost. The recent exegesis holds that Christ promised no more than the common supply of divine grace and the ordinary concurrence of divine Providence; and that it is unwarrantable to explain the words of any extra ordinary immediate assistance in the way of plenary inspira tion, or in the exercise of a theopneustic gift. In reply to this, it may suffice to say that we have only to reflect on the circumstances and condition of the apostles at the time when the Lord uttered the words, to be convinced that, according to the usage and scope of language, it is unwarrantable to refer those memorable promises as to the Holy Spirit's operations on their minds either to ordinary grace, or to the enlargement of their minds in the natural leadings of Providence. The</p>
      
      <p> Lord Jesus was preparing the disciples in these later promises for the approaching separation, when they should be left without the visible guidance and immediate direction they had heretofore enjoyed. They had up to that moment turned to Him in every difficulty, distrusting their own wisdom, and willing to be led. And as they would be troubled and paralyzed at His death, He promised another guide, the Comforter, who should be to them what He had been, and who was permanently to abide with them.</p>
      <p> In the proposition laid down, it was affirmed that prophets and apostles were supplied by the Spirit with gifts which must be distinguished from ordinary grace. The modern doctrine maintains the opposite of this; and the advocates of the mediating theology agree in the denial of it. Dr. Rothe, who is usually represented as the author of a conclusive discussion on the subject, labours to make out that the inspiration of the Biblical writers is identical with the spiritual illumination imparted to every Christian. He limits the aid of the Spirit to the work of enlightening their minds to apprehend the objective revelation, but does not place it in the immediate production of a divine message, or of religious knowledge for officially guiding and directing others. But inspiration, whether found in the Old Testament prophets or the New Testament apostles, must be distinguished from common spiritual illumination, if we are not minded, in the indulgence of mere prepossessions and theories, to confound what Scripture has plainly separated. The modern identifica tion of the two must be denied if we take into account either the distinction of natural and ordinary, and supernatural and extraordinary gifts, or the purpose for which the latter were expressly given. The object of the Spirit in conferring the purely personal illumination was to enable men involved in corruption and darkness to appropriate the offered grace of the gospel. The object of the Holy Spirit in conferring inspiration, on the other hand, was  OFFICIAL,  to qualify</p>
      
      <p> prophets and apostles to deliver a divine communication unmingled with foreign elements. It is only necessary to appeal, in proof of this, to the terms of the commission with which they were invested.</p>
      <p> As to the Old Testament prophets, their commission, as well as their official messages, are sufficiently apparent from the preface commonly prefixed to their communications.: " Thus saith the Lord." And we cannot examine their lofty, and frequently awful, announcements without perceiving that they had received their intimations as to the future in so many words. Often they did not themselves comprehend them, and had to inquire and search what the Spirit, which was in them, did signify  (1  Pet. i. 11). And they were held bound, under the penalty of death, to fulfil to the letter what the Spirit enjoined, as appears from the sad end of the unnamed prophet, who had been sent to cry against the altar in Bethel (1 Kings xiii. 21 ff.).</p>
      <p> In their oral communications to the people, to kings and princes, they seem to have had a copious flow of discourse, or a brief and condensed message according to the peculiarity of the times and occasions.</p>
      <p> When we inquire whether divine action was suspended or withdrawn from the apostles in the execution of their office, we find—(1) that the promises given to them went far beyond the idea of their being left to the exercise of their own wisdom; (2) that miracles and supernatural gifts in all their rich variety abode with them to the end of their career. And these miraculous gifts were signs and pledges of the unseen miracle of plenary inspiration upon their minds. The following considerations will suffice to prove that the theo-pneustic gift is not to be reduced to the level of ordinary grace:—</p>
      <p> 1. The theory which merges the distinction between ordi nary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, loses sight of the divine sovereignty which the entire Scripture presupposes as</p>
      
      <p> to God's speaking by chosen organs to His Church (Heb. i. 1). All believers, it is true, receive in the same way the renewing of the Holy Ghost and the salvation of the gospel. But it was not so with the communication of the supernatural gifts. Let me illustrate this by an example. When Peter said to the impotent man : " In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk," we trace the clearest evidence of a divine communication (Acts iii. 6); or when he said: "/Eneas, Jesus Christ inaketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed" (ix. 34), we see such an intimation conveyed by the Spirit to the apostle's mind, that he was left in no doubt as to the issue. He fully believed and expected that the words, which were divinely inspired and prophetic, would no sooner be uttered than they would be accompanied with the miraculous result which followed. There we see the invisible inspiration and the visible sign, the latter the pledge of the former. We can trace the existence of a divine communication or invisible miracle on Peter's mind, as well as the visible miracle in the immediate cure,—a miracle of knowledge and a miracle of power conjoined, a prophecy and an accomplishment united. Without adducing other instances of the same thing scattered over the whole page of revelation, let it suffice to say that in all such miracles the theopneustic gift was announced and attested by the supernatural fact. The cessation of those miraculous gifts at the close of the apostolic age—when they had served the important function to which we have referred in the infancy of the Church—was a noteworthy and signifi cant fact. But, during the whole period of their continuance, they were a sign and pledge, as well as an explanation, of the presence and reality of the theopneustic gift. The theory which identifies the composition of Scripture with the exercise of ordinary grace, is burdened with insuperable difficulties. The design of referring all to a general law, is to make the matter more acceptable to the understanding. It is not by general rationalistic reasonings, however, that historic facts are</p>
      
      <p> to be determined; and this point must be decided as a matter of fact.</p>
      <p> The conclusion to which we come, therefore, is, that the gift of inspiration  differs in kind,  and not merely in measure, from the operation of ordinary grace. We have ample evidence to prove that the apostles, as the organs of Christ's revelation to the Church, were the subjects of a supernatural intervention absolutely unique, and essentially distinct in kind, from the general experience of Christian disciples. The gift of plenary inspiration was limited to individuals selected by divine sovereignty, and temporary in duration. It ter minated with the closing of the canon, that is, when the revelation was completed. The other is common to all true Christians.</p>
      <p> 2.   It must  be further  remarked, that  the  theory which makes   inspiration   identical   with   ordinary   grace,   fails   to account for  THE AUTHORITY  which Scripture uniformly claims and asserts for itself as the word of God, and  which the Church, Jewish and Christian, has always with one consent ascribed to it.     If the prophets of the Old Testament, or the apostles in the Xew Testament,  had nothing of direct and divine communication essentially distinguishing their words and writings from those of ordinary disciples, it is not possible to   give   any   explanation   of   the   divine   authority   always ascribed   to  their  announcements as   distinct  from those of ordinary men.     The declaration on the part of the prophets when   they   said:   " Thus   saith  the   Lord,"  or on the part of  apostles   when  they  introduced  their  Epistles with  the words:   " Paul,  an  apostle,"   " Peter,   an   apostle   of  Jesus Christ," not only implies that they derived their commission from above, but intimates:   " He that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given to us His Holy Spirit" (1 Thess. iv. 8).</p>
      <p> 3.   And what would necessarily follow if, according to the current    German   theory,    inspiration    were    identical   with</p>
      
      <p> ordinary illumination ? A simple  reductio ad absurdum will here suffice. If the difference between the two was merely in degree, and not in kind, the theopneustic gift must be regarded as universal and coincident with true discipleship. But every one perceives that this is not the case. More than that, revelation on such a supposition would have no finality, but be an ever increasing quantity, with new developments without limit. Xor do we see how, on the theory which we impugn, extravagant or enthusiastic develop ments could be either reduced to a standard or stopped. If Scripture were not viewed as a completed revelation, with an absolute finality, we should be compelled to canvass in every age the claims of such growths as Montanism, or Irvingism, or modern Romanism, whose ecclesiastical organs, as is proved by the Vatican decrees, lay claim to a self-developing advance in doctrine, which asserts itself as equivalent to a sort of inspiration. By the finality of apostolic doctrine, we can nip all this in the bud. We conclude, therefore, that it is a vain attempt to identify illumination common to all believers, with inspiration peculiar to prophets and apostles. The latter are said to speak with the same authority as Christ Himself (Luke x. 16), which they could do only on the ground of official commission, not on the ground of personal illumination.</p>
      <p> I said, moreover, in the proposition laid down, that super natural revelation was given  in Tinman forms of speech.  This is one significant proof of the divine condescension of the Holy Spirit, that instead of speaking in an elevated style of diction, and in the communication only of ideas above the capacity or range of the bulk of mankind, or merely for cul tured and philosophic minds, He speaks from one mind to another in easy, clear, and perspicuous language, level to the apprehension of all tribes and nations. This is the glory of the Spirit's work of revelation, however profound the things themselves mav be to which the revelation refers. It is not</p>
      
      <p> necessary to define the  MODE OF INSPIRATION,  but only to assert the divine fact. We take the historic fact; but we decline every attempt to explain the inscrutable mode. That the theopneustic gift was imparted, is evident from the explicit statement that all Scripture is God-inspired (2 Tim. iii. 16), and that holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2 1'et. i. 21). But no finite mind can venture, without presumption, to say how the human faculties con curred and acted with the Spirit's activity in the expression of a divine oracle. So various, in fact, was the mode of His divine communications, that it is impossible to frame a theory which either takes in all the facts or exhibits the manifold variety of ways in which the Almighty Spirit, who alone has the key to the human heart and to all its powers, was pleased to communicate His will. We repudiate all attempts to explain the mode in which revelation was conveyed to the human mind, or by inspired men to the mind of others. We conserve the miracle and the mystery. All such theories as the suggestion, elevation, and guidance or superintendence, propounded by Doddridge and others, only darken counsel by words without knowledge. With Dr. Chalmers we fully agree when he says: " The important question with us is not the process of the manufacture, but the qualities of the resulting commodity. The former we hold not to be a rele vant, and we are not sure that it is a legitimate inquiry."  l Our system is to have no system. We maintain the fact and leave the mode untouched, because beyond our ken. The French writers, such as Gaussen, M. d'Aubigne, Monod, Jalaquier, and liemond, write with more reserve and caution than any other class of theologians in modern times. Thus Gaussen, in the same spirit with Chalmers, said, when taken to task for his admirable book: " My theory," said he, " is to have no theory." While repudiating the notion that the human element absorbed the divine, and the theory that 1  See his admirable chapter on Inspiration in his  Evidences.</p>
      
      <p> every word was given by direct dictation, we hold that the only safe and judicious ground to occupy is to maintain the fact, and to regard the mode as inexplicable. The Scripture, with that reticence which is one of its marked peculiarities, gives no disclosure of the mode which the Holy Ghost adopted. And on this whole subject, enveloped as it is in mystery, we may affirm with confidence that the facts are so various as to be incapable of classification by any investi gator; that the message came in the Old Testament in audible words, in dreams, in visions, in ecstasies or raptures, and in the New Testament by the Spirit's recalling the things spoken by Christ to memory, and by showing the apostles many things which they could not bear while Christ was with them. But our ignorance of the method not only dis qualifies us from forming a consistent theory, but actually supplies a source of security and satisfaction.</p>
      <p> The Scripture is the word of God, inspired throughout by the Spirit of God in every part, and given in human forms of expression. We must by no means maintain, that the sacred writers were nothing but machines—nay, must be upon our guard against the attempt to define the undefinable. That a supernatural and miraculous operation prompted holy men to. speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and that the mental peculiarity of the writers \vas not suppressed by the theopneustic gift, as appears from their peculiar style and expression, must be accepted as the two sides of a great truth, which some have attempted to explain by immediate suggestion or dictation. But it is better not to attempt to explain the inexplicable. We define not the nature or mode of the miracle or divine intervention; for miracle it was; and Scripture omits all more particular definition beyond the fact that holy men were wrought upon and moved by the Holy Ghost (2 Pet. i. 21). And we accept its silences as well as its disclosures. When Scripture stops, we stop.</p>
      <p> That there was infallible supernatural guidance, and that</p>
      
      <p> this extends to all the canonical books in the Old and New Testament, is undoubted. But how it acted it would be at once perilous and audacious to define, and a contented nescience is better than a presumptuous knowledge. The analogy between Christ's Person and the Scriptures has often been adduced, and truly serves as an illustration. The two fold nature in the one Person of our Lord is there, and con curring to one result. But it is not possible to say where the one nature begins and the other ends in the production of the great redemption-work. His utterances and actions, divine yet human, were the utterances and actions of the God-man. I repeat, I retain the miracle and the mystery.</p>
      <p> Another point laid down by us was, that  the theopnenstic  &lt; gift and Scripture are co-extensive.  The current theory of the day is the reverse of this. It asserts that a line is to be drawn between Scripture and the word of God; that God's word must be held to mean, not Scripture as we find it, but a certain spiritual kernel or religious substance which is to be extracted by a critical process; that, in a word, the Scripture is but the husk or shell in which the word of God is found, as the quartz is separated from the gold embedded in it.</p>
      <p> Though many theologians of this century make this the foundation of their system, there is absolutely nothing to countenance or support it from Genesis to Pievelation. And to establish the opposite, it is enough to adduce what Jesus said: " Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods ? If He called them gods, to whom  the word of God  came, and the Scripture  cannot be broken," etc. (John x. 34). He repre sents the word of God and the Scripture as identical. But it is asked : Is not the theopneustic gift spoken of by the Apostle Paul in such a way as to give countenance to the idea that some directions such as those relating to conjugal ditties were given without any supernatural guidance, as when he says : " I speak this by permission, and not by commandment" (1 Cor.</p>
      
      <p> vii. 6) ? The true rendering is : "I speak this by indulgence, or allowance, to you, not by commandment"  (icara o-vyyvcofj-rjv, ov Kar evriTayriv).  And in another passage, where he says : " I command, yet not I, but the Lord," the allusion is unmis takably to the Lord's own teaching, in the days of His flesh, revealing the Father's mind. When he says: " To the rest speak I, not the Lord," he communicates a further inspired announcement given to the apostle himself.</p>
      <p> The theory advocated by that school, with a zeal worthy of a better cause, simply explodes the revelation of word, and appeals to the revelation of fact. It disjoins what cannot be disjoined. It declares, with an audacity approaching to bravado, that Christianity can dispense with any doctrine of inspiration. On the contrary, the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures may be called a question of existence for the Protestant Church, which is not supported by that reserve power of tradition and of authority which gives coherence and strength to the Eomish system. It is obvious that the Protestant Church cannot forego the authority of Scripture, or, which amounts to the same thing, permit it to be regarded as the word of man, without inevitable defeat and ruin. The theological conflicts of the time may be said to hinge for the most part on the view which has been accepted on the doctrine of inspiration, or may be traced back to the opinions which have found currency on this point. In fact, we may affirm that no doctrine has assumed more varying aspects in the Protestant Church,—every change of theological opinion finding its echo or making its vibrations felt in the question of inspiration, on which all other truths ultimately depend.</p>
      <p> In conclusion, I will subjoin a brief allusion to some points of moment connected \vith this topic.</p>
      <p> 1. The testimony of the Holy Spirit to the Scriptures. This is an operation of the Spirit in the exercise of His applicatory grace, by and through the Scriptures themselves. Whatever enthusiasts may have" held, no judicious divine ever</p>
      
      <p> asserted that the Spirit gives this internal criterion, or testifies without the word or apart from the word itself. On the contrary, they always, in express terras, declared that we owe this testimony to the efficacy of the Spirit and word con jointly, not separately. They ascribed the effect to the Spirit not without the word, but by the word (not  extra aut citra vcrbum).  The testimony of Scripture about itself, and the efficacious testimony of the Spirit, concur to one result. The enthusiasts who have been wont to call the written word a dead letter, commonly speak of the Spirit as illuminating and regenerating the mind without the word; and Calvinistic divines have often had occasion to complain of a wrong done them by the Lutherans, in representing them as maintaining an immediate testimony of the Spirit. None of their best divines did so. They held that, as the sun is seen by his own light, Scripture is known by its own efficacy and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 2. The reception of the Spirit's supernatural inspiration lays the foundation for  ALL THE AUTHORITY  of revelation. Kevelation is accepted and obeyed not on the ground of its adaptation to my reason or conscience,—though it is in har mony with both,—but on the ground of its supernatural and theopneustic character. Its " Thus saith the Lord" carries with it the demand for prompt unquestioning submission. And though it accredits itself experimentally, it starts from a heavenly attestation which constrains consent. All true faith, in a word, is from authority, and rests primarily on the evidence of miracles and prophecy. It is this faith of authority that has given rise to all the achievements, devo tional ardour, and martyr zeal of the Christian Church.</p>
      <p> The other school, known as that of  CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUS NESS,  advocates the autonomy of the Christian mind and the Church's emancipation from the outward letter of the Scrip ture. It maintains bold and perilous positions. It maintains (1) that the New Testament Is rather the expression of the</p>
      
      <p> Christian consciousness and of the Church's life than authori tative revelation ; (2) that the Church is rather to be governed by the living progressive Spirit of the Church than by the letter of Scripture; (3) that evangelical doctrine receives new forms and phases from the Christian consciousness and the ever-developing influence of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> Schleiermacher, to whom this school owes its origin, broke away from a faith of authority, and assumed the Christian consciousness or pious feeling as the source of knowledge and the matter of his science. He wished to secure for theology an independent territory against philosophy and the higher criticism. And, with a boldness amounting to bravado, the leaders of that school propound the most negative opinions. To affirm that the Christian consciousness is the source of spiritual knowledge is, in fact, a Quaker principle—defective and one-sided. It puts the Spirit within instead of the word without, the only full expression of the Spirit's mind. It furnishes but guesses at truth. The Christian consciousness is not the  NORMA  NOBMANS, but  NORMA NORMATA.</p>
      
      <p> L E C T U E E   IV.</p>
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.</p>
      <p> Spirit's work in the application of redemption to the -•- individual will next engage our attention. And we must carry with us the thought that the whole interposition of the Spirit of God rests on the ground of the Mediator's finished work. Obstacles stood in the way of the Spirit's return to the human heart of such a kind, that they were insur mountable by any finite resources. But they are put out of the way by Christ's vicarious sacrifice and royal priesthood — that is, by merit and efficacy, or purchase and power.</p>
      <p> The efficacious operation of the Spirit presupposes God's sovereign love to individuals, or a personal election. Con sidered from the true point of view, the electing purpose of God implies that its efficacy has a special destination, and that it will reach its proper objects. They who interpret the divine word by the primary axiom that all men must share alike, and who impugn the absolute right of God to bestow salvation as men bestow their alms on whom He will by a purely free donation, forget, in their anxiety to be on a friendly footing with the Spirit of the age, that the advantage which their theory seems to gain by enlarging the extent of God's love is more than counterbalanced at another point — by lack of efficacy. God's love finds out its objects. It is something far other than a mere benevolent but inefficacious desire in the divine mind which wishes, but does not poten tially  will,  the salvation of men.</p>
      <p> The presuppositions  or postulates of the doctrine of the</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      163</p>
      <p> Spirit, so far as man's necessities are concerned, are the following:—Their impotence for good takes for granted —  first,  their want of the Spirit and of all spiritual life; secondly,  a subjection to the kingdom of sin and Satan; and thirdly,  a voluntary aversion to God and rebellion against Him. This suggests a threefold corresponding inquiry :  first, how is the forfeited presence of the Spirit restored to the human heart, and what effects accompany His return ? secondly,  how are the effectually called translated from the family of Satan into the state of adopted sons ? and  thirdly, how is corrupted nature fully changed and made meet here and hereafter for the love and service of God ? The first two points will be considered by us in the present lecture.</p>
      <p> I. The forfeited presence of the Spirit is restored by Christ's mediatorship and obedience to God's law, in precept and penalty. They who fail to apprehend the atonement, or reduce it to an empty pageant or governmental expedient, in effect remove this mission of the Comforter from its de pendence on the finished work of Christ as the basis or meritorious ground of the Spirit's return to the human heart. They connect the atonement not with the require ments of the divine nature and the inflexible law of God, but with a supposed public justice, which amounts only to a rectoral display or a deterring motive, but secures nothing. They forget, in the zealous advocacy of their universalism, that the Lord God is the only august public worthy of regard, and that there is no other to which the Most High will adapt His administration. But the question is not as to the extent of the atonement, which rests with the divine good pleasure, but as to its validity as a procuring cause or price, which many, in their anxiety to represent as meant for all, totally denude of its efficacy. They thus undermine the suretyship, substitution, and imputation on which the gift of the Spirit proceeds. They explode the deep federal oneness</p>
      
      <p> which lies at the foundation of the whole transaction, and secures the inalienable supply of the Spirit to all for whom the atonement was offered.</p>
      <p> The nature of man's ruin, as implying the forfeiture of the Spirit, furnishes the  rationale  of the entire doctrine of the Spirit. Man is no longer a  SPIRITUAL BEING,  and they who speak in that way of his capacities and powers, and of the condition of human nature as it now is, introduce a form of speech which has no true application to the subject. Viewed in his unfallen state, of which the renewed man has some faint conception, and of which the Spirit-filled humanity of Jesus was the true image, man might be described as a spiritual being. But with no propriety of language can the expression  SPIRITUAL  be applied to man in his fallen state. So far as the expression is intended to obviate the objection that the operations of the Spirit violate the integrity of man's moral nature, the language may be capable of some vindica tion, because it brings us back to the true idea of anthro pology, and because original sin was never understood, except by Macius, to have become the substance of the man. But the term " spiritual" has so precise a sense, and is so connected in our language with Biblical usage, that every other acceptation is to be avoided as liable to miscon ception.</p>
      <p> If we delineate men's actual relation to God, they are described as having not the Spirit (Jude 19), and, as the necessary consequence of this, as sensual or natural (1 Cor. ii. 14); in other words, so sunk into animal life that their wisdom is earthly (Jas. iv. 15), and they themselves without God (Eph. ii. 12).</p>
      <p> God gave the Spirit to Adam, the earthly and spiritual elements of His constitution being so fully balanced that he was neither preponderantly animal nor absolutely pneumatic, but a living soul occupied in all his faculties by the indwell ing Spirit. And had he continued stedfast, or taken the true</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      165</p>
      <p> way, which corresponded with the idea of man, he would have passed in a straight course into the pneumatic or spiritual without tasting of death. But by his apostasy the Spirit departed, and he was left in possession of a mere natural or animal being, having not the Spirit (Jude 19). That the soul is deprived of the Spirit and of all divine light, and that he is not disposed to those objects which the law of God enjoins, is too evident to be questioned. Only conscience is left to act in him along with the dim outline of the moral law, of which the lingering remains may still be traced on every human heart. And it may be said of conscience, that its voice is heard more in accusing than in excusing. It is noteworthy that in the entire earthly life of Jesus there is no mention of conscience, for the obvious reason that He had the full image of God, and received the Spirit not by measure.</p>
      <p> Thus detached from his primeval ties by the forfeiture of the Spirit, man follows the natural rather than the spiritual, the human rather than the divine. The religious sentiment gives way in all his course before the prevailing influence of the worldly mind. The wrong choice, which in fact is uniformly adopted, must be traced to a wrong bias; and till the nature is renewed by the restoration of the Spirit, no motive brought to bear on men's minds avails to turn them toward God. Acting from a bias which draws the mind away, they prefer the shadowy to the real, the speculative to the practical, the superficial and sensuous to those profoundly spiritual and humbling discoveries which are called forth by the divine word. On this point it is necessary to adjust the balance with the utmost delicacy to preserve the due equipoise. Full emphasis must be given, in all the discussion of this question, to the original state of that fair structure, of which Howe remarks with novel beauty: " The stately ruins are visible to every eye that bear in their front yet extant this doleful inscription :  HERE GOD ONCE  DWELT." 1</p>
      
      <p> The absence of the Spirit, which man, as originally formed, possessed as the Spirit of illumination in his understanding, and of power in all his faculties, has left the mind in moral and spiritual impotence. If regard be had to the understand ing, the unconverted cannot know the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. ii. 14); to the will, he cannot 1  be subject to the law of God (Rom. viii. 7); to worship, he cannot call Jesus Lord (1 Cor. xii. 3); to practice, he cannot please God (Bom. viii. 8); to fruit, he cannot bear fruit (John xv. 4); to faith, he cannot receive the Spirit of truth (John xiv. 17). His familiarity with sacred truths, which he does not love, only leaves him seared in conscience and twice dead. For this impotence the regenerating power of the Holy Ghost is absolutely indispensable.</p>
      <p> The fact of man's inability, which Scripture everywhere asserts or implies, is to be explained by the withdrawal of the Spirit, which left him in  SPIRITUAL DEATH.  Scripture, therefore, in terms the most express, denies to man the power or ability to think a good thought (2 Cor. iii. 5), or to receive the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. ii. 14); and declares that human nature is wholly turned away from God, and enmity against Him (Bom. viii. 7); and this state of the heart has a determining influence on the will in all reliuious and</p>
      <p> O   O</p>
      <p> moral judgments.</p>
      <p> That decisive fact is not apprehended in the same way in Christian and philosophic thought, even where the latter makes the nearest approximation to the truth. The uniform language of Christianity is that it is the state of the will, in other words, of the heart, that either illuminates or darkens the understanding in its spiritual or moral views, arid that the relation between the two is not like ordinary knowledge, according to which we must first know a thing before we love it; for, on the contrary, the secularized mind must first love divine things with a spiritual relish before it fully knows 1  Xo true exegete will allow that the  *&gt;l  Si/'vara/ is simply equivalent to  ol £i?.u.</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      167</p>
      <p> them. Hence there is an important sense in which we may affirm that it is not the intellectual knowledge which deter mines the conclusions of the will, but, conversely, the tendency of the will or heart which determines the judgment of the understanding. That is, beyond question, the mode of state ment given in the Scriptures, which put spiritual life before true knowledge, the renewal of the heart before the possibility of a spiritual judgment. Coleridge, in his  Literary Remains, beautifully remarks: " I believe and hold it as the funda mental article of Christianity, that I am a fallen creature ; that I am of myself capable of moral evil, but not of myself capable of moral good, and that  an evil ground existed in my will  previously to any given act, or assignable moment of time, in my consciousness; I am born a child of wrath. This fearful mystery I pretend not to understand. I cannot even conceive the possibility of it, but I know that it is so. My conscience, the sole fountain of certainty, commands me to believe it, and would itself be a contradiction, were it not so —and what is real must be possible."</p>
      <p> Into the discussion of the relation of free-will and divine grace we are not required, by the topic which we are treating, to enter in all its bearings. As it is often handled, it is frequently more a metaphysical debate on the laws of mind than a question in exegetical or Biblical theology. On the subject of free-will and the Spirit's agency, the following remarks may suffice : Man's  free agency is postulated  by every one who apprehends the subject with any measure of precision, as a point which may be described as necessary to his personality and responsibility as a rational creature. But along with the admission of spontaneity and freedom, we must not less strongly hold that man in his natural state, under the forfeiture of the Spirit, uniformly chooses the evil in preference to the good. On the one hand, he is free from co-action or constraint, even when the will is carried headlong in a career of sin. On the other hand,  THE WILL ITSELF  is</p>
      
      <p> DISEASED  and vitiated. These are the two sides of the question; and when we put them together, we say with Augustin: " The will is always free, but not always good." The will cannot cease to be free, without ceasing to exist. Man could not be deprived of that freedom without the entire destruction of his mental being, as a rational and responsible creature. The liberty of the will consists in this, that he is not carried headlong by blind fatalistic impulse or by natural necessity or constraint. Whatever he does, he freely does. But the will may be free, and not liberated. He may be a free agent, and yet the servant of sin. The will may be free, and only exercise' its freedom against the will of God. I strongly hold the duty of asserting the freedom of the will and the necessity of divine grace as two sides of an inex plicable mystery in the same way as holds true of many other theological points. My duty is to conserve the mystery which the nationalistic understanding is only too prone to invade—to assert it, not to explain, far less to explode it.</p>
      <p> THE SAYINGS OF JESUS ON THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN REGENERATION.</p>
      <p> 1. "  Verily, verily, I say imio tlice, Except a man l&gt;c lorn ttfjain, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . . . Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and tluit which is born of the Sjjirit is spirit " (John iii. 3—6). Nicodemus came to question the Lord about His mission, and the kingdom of God which he plainly saw was about to be set up. But he was at once met by the practical question bearing on his personal salvation. By tin's it at once appeared that Jesus came not to be catechised and to answer curious questions, but to teach what bore upon the salvation of His hearers. He made answer rather to the state of mind than to the words of Nicodemus. He showed that a change upon the whole man was indispensably necessary, if he should ever</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING-WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      169</p>
      <p> have a right of citizenship in the kingdom of God, which does not here mean the eternal felicity, but the Messianic kingdom in all its amplitude of meaning.</p>
      <p> As to the phrase "born again," it is expounded by one class of interpreters as meaning  a second time,  by another as meaning  from above,  and the decision based on the general parallelism of Scripture falls very commonly in favour of the rendering  a second time.  But it must be admitted that neither the import of the term  (civwQev)  nor the style of expression used by John in speaking of regeneration lends it any countenance. 1  For iny own part, I am more disposed to accept it as a peculiarity of John's style of language borrowed from his Master, and as denoting  FROM ABOVE.  The Lord repeats His statement as to the necessity of regeneration, and adds the twofold principle or cause by which it is produced : lorn of water and of the Spirit.  These terms intimate the meritorious and efficient cause.</p>
      <p> The term  WATER  has been variously interpreted. (1) Some refer it to baptism,—an opinion current in Patristic theology from the earliest times, and asserted in the Greek and Latin Church and in some of the Protestant formularies. But it is</p>
      <p> 1  Most of the versions, the Lutheran, French, English, Dutch, translate  again, and have been mainly influenced by the reply of Nicodemus, who, in asking whether a man could enter his mother's womb again, uses the term rendered a second time (Sturspat)  (ver. 4). On the other hand, the Greek exegetes, Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and of the moderns Storr, Noesselt, Schleusner, Liicke, and others, render the word  from above :  and their arguments are these : (1) The general, though not uniform, New Testament usage (John iii. 13, xix. 11, 23 ; Jas. i. 17, iii. 15 ; Mark xv. 38; Matt, xxvii. 51). (2) Jesus alternates the expression with another which is equivalent to  from above,  when He says that which is  born of the Spirit.  (3) The Evangelist John, when referring to regeneration, always describes it as a birth from God (John i. 13 ; 1 John ii. 29, iii. 9, iv. 7, v. 1, 4, 18). (4) Nicodemus' word, which has done more to sway expositors than anything else, is not construed with being born, but with entering again into his mother's womb. All these reasons incline the balance toward the rendering  from above.  But, on the other hanJ, the general New Testament parallelism seems to incline it in favour of the rendering "a second time " (Tit. iii. 5 ; 1 Pet. i. 3 ; 2 Cor. v. 17). If we decide in favour of the translation  born again, —with most of the Protestant versions,—it can only be upon the ground of the general parallelism of the apostles' language.</p>
      
      <p> untenable, as will be evident to every mind that weighs the matter in the light of common observation. The water to which the Lord refers  CERTAINLY REGENERATES,  and entitles those who receive it to enter the kingdom of God, from which no true member can ever be cast out again,—which cannot be affirmed of baptism in every case. (2) Some take it as a hendiadys,—a view in which most of the lieformed divines concur,—implying that the Spirit acts with a cleans ing efficacy like that of water. (3) Some of the ablest Dutch divines, for example Cocceius, Vitringa, Lainpe, interpret the water here named in the light of Ezekiel's words: " Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean " (chap, xxxvi. 25). "With these last interpreters I fully concur. The  sprinklings, ablutions, lustrations,  common in the Mosaic ritual, primarily referred to the removal of the guilt which rendered the person of the worshipper unclean, and removed him from all approach to God in sanctuary service. The purification of the leper, and of those who were unclean by contact with the dead, was effected by sprinkling them with Avater in which a portion of blood, or of the ashes of the red heifer, according to the law, was mingled (Lev. xiv. 1; Num. xix. 1 ff.). It is not to be forgotten that Nicodemus was an accomplished teacher, and was profoundly conversant with all the Mosaic rites. He knew well that on the occasion of taking Israel into covenant Moses took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people (Heb. ix. 19) ; and that a laver, deriving all its value from the altar, or the victims slain on it, was prepared between the altar and the entrance of the tabernacle, that they who approached the Holy One might be made clean. The water referred to by our Lord in this con nection was but the ceremonial expression for the cleansing of our person by His own obedience or atoning sacrifice, proving the complete removal of guilt and of everything that could exclude us on the Around of law from the kingdom of God.</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      171</p>
      <p> The second term,  SPIRIT,  is the personal Holy Spirit, who gives the inward capacity or fitness for the kingdom of God, who breaks the power of sin, and makes all things new. The water and the Spirit are not to be confounded. They are</p>
      <p> THE TWO CONJOINED ELEMENTS ; ill Other words, the MERI TORIOUS  CAUSE  and the  EFFICIENT CAUSE,  which introduce the sinner into the kingdom of God. The  WATER  and the  SPIRIT are not to be explained as a mere hendiadys, or the use of two words for one. The terms are plainly adapted to the tenor of Ezekiel's prophecy (chap, xxxvi. 25 ff.) (comp. Zech. xiii.), and are both intended to be significant.</p>
      <p> A third time, with a view to make the statement as to the necessity of regeneration more urgent and emphatic, our Lord substantially repeats His declaration: " Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again." And then, to anti cipate all cavil or exception to the mode in which that omnipotent act of God displays itself, He adds: " The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit" (ver. 8). That this analogy is taken from nature, and is much like one of His parables, is not doubtful. They who have attempted, with Origen and Augustin, to dismiss the comparison and take the term translated  wind  for the personal Spirit, have nothing to say in answer to the argument that all these expressions: " bloweth," " the sound thereof," " the hearing of the sound," and the implied analogy in the words " so is every one"  must be accepted as an illustrative description or comparison. The wind, as a natural phenomenon at that moment,—as in the case of many of our Lord's illustrations,—might arrest their attention. The points of comparison are obviously these: (1) The Spirit's agency is sovereign, like the wind blowing where it will; (2) The mode of His activity is inscrutable: it is like the wind, in regard to which we can neither say where it begins to blow nor where it is hushed to rest ;</p>
      
      <p> (3) The efficacy is irresistible anil the effects indubitable; we hear the sound thereof.</p>
      <p> 2.   A passage of similar import is the following: "  It is the Spirit that quickcncth; the flesh proflteth nothing"  (Johuvi. Go). Christ  does   not  say  my flesh,   as  in  the previous  context, where He carries on a discussion with the men of Capernaum; and the change of expression is significant.     Interpreters, not perceiving this, have been carried away with the misleading impression that the design was merely to remove offence in the Jewish mind  caused  by the declaration that Jesus was the   bread   of life.     They think  that  He  still  continues to declare that the true life of redeemed men is meritoriously connected   with   His    atoning    death.      But   Luther,   when pressed by this text in the  sacramentarian controversy, saw the change of expression, and accurately referred the words to the carnal sense of imrenewed men.     It is no longer " my flesh," as  in  all  the previous  context; the  expression " the flesh"  has   no   reference   to  the  flesh  of Christ.     It is the same  antithesis  that  we   find  in  the interview with   Nico-demus: " That which is born of the flesh is flesh."     The five thousand who would have made Him  king were  so  deeply offended by His teaching, that they had in a body forsaken Him; and the reason of their conduct is here traced to the unspirituality and  enmity  of   the  carnal  mind.     Our   Lord declares : it is the Spirit that quickeneth, or imparts the life of   God—a    boon   requiring   omnipotent    power.      To   one acquainted with the antithesis between   flesh and spirit, or with Scripture language generally, it is plain that the allusion is not to the human spirit nor to Christ's divine nature, but to the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 3.   We come now to what may be called, perhaps, the most conclusive  passage on the Spirit's work in connection with conversion in  the whole compass of Scripture.     "  And when He is come He will reprove  (better:  convince) the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:  of sin, because  (better:</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.      1*73</p>
      <p> in regard to the fact that} they believe not on me ; of righteous ness, because  (better :  in regard to the fact that] I go to my Father, and ye see me no more ; of judgment, because  (better: in regard to the fact that) the prince of this world is judged " (John xvi. 8-11). The passage contains a full and exhaus tive description of the Spirit's work in the application of redemption, as well as of the mission of the Comforter by the Son from the Father (John xv. 26). The verb setting forth the Spirit's function  (eXey£e*)  may bear one of two senses— TO REPROVE  or  TO CONVINCE.  The grounds for the decision, in every special instance, are supplied by the context. The signification to reprove, which the term some times bears, implies that a person is reproved for some error which he has previously held. The other meaning, to con vince, implies that a person is convinced of some truth previously unknown or unrealized. The term may either mean to reprove and refute a false opinion, or to convince one by cogent arguments and ample evidence as to truth hitherto unknown. Both senses are closely linked together. The notion of reproving, for which some contend, is wholly to be removed from the use of the term in this passage. Though they can both be made to have a show of probability, it is every way preferable, for various reasons, to accept the meaning  TO CONVINCE.</p>
      <p> To take one conclusive argument. All the objects are not reprehensible, and therefore the idea of reproof is not appli cable to them all. Not only so ; the verb is introduced but once, and not three times, in connection with the three nouns SIN, RIGHTEOUSNESS,  and  JUDGMENT  ; and therefore no possible ground exists for admitting any other than a uniform sense, which is equally applicable to them all.</p>
      <p> Another point is the signification of the particle, which is three times expressed in connection with the several mem bers (viz. on). It cannot be rendered, as in the English version,  because,  but  in respect to the fact that.  It is here an</p>
      
      <p> exegetical or specifying particle, setting forth that specific kind of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, to which allusion shall be made. In all the members it must certainly .be so taken, because the grammatical structure is uniform, and the maintenance of the same signification yields through out an appropriate sense. This conclusion militates decidedly against giving to the verb the signification " to reprove," because tilings are mentioned which, so far from being censurable, are infinitely to be desired in the last two clauses.</p>
      <p> We are told, indeed, by the celebrated Gerhard that some exegetes did give in this way the specific meaning to the particle (ort), and yet contrived to interpret the verb as meaning  to reprove,  by the addition of certain words which it was thought might competently be supplied though they were not expressed. They filled up a supposed ellipsis as follows: He shall reprove the world of sin committed, of righteousness despised, of judgment neglected.</p>
      <p> But when we examine that exposition, which found favour with not a few, many objections present themselves. It is a harsh ellipsis on the most indulgent consideration. Reproof always strikes on what is reprehensible—that is, either upon evil done or upon persons favoured with privileges and chargeable with neglect. But the special neglect must always be expressed. Not only so; on such a construc tion of the words, not one expression, but various supple mentary words, must be supplied to bring out the import. It renders the whole unnatural and obscure to introduce a different verb to every noun, and it is somewhat pre sumptuous ; for who is warranted to supplement the language of our Lord by additions which are not in the text ? Nor are such additions at all in harmony with the plain and obvious tenor of Christ's words. We are not then—under the impression that the verb means " to reprove "—to resort to any supplement so harsh, unnecessary, and unsuitable.</p>
      
      <p> The words are natural and perspicuous as they stand, if we adopt the other rendering— TO CONVINCE.  The meaning is then plain. The proper idea is that of convincing one of any thing not truly or fully known. And the objects, as they stand, are of such a nature that one may be convinced of them all, but not reproved for them all. And if we carry with us the thought that the Spirit is occupied about the sin of unbelief, which is the greatest of sins,—about imputed righteousness, the only valid plea with God, acquired by Christ's obedience unto death,—about the judgment of the prince of this world,—the language is easy and the sentence natural.</p>
      <p> To come to the import of the term "shall convince." When it is said that the Spirit shall convince the world,— that is, men generally without the partition-wall between Jew and Gentile,—it means much more than mere instruction in revealed truth. Eather it implies that the Spirit, in spite of the ignorance and resistance of the carnal mind, will bring men to such a perception of the reality and importance of saving truth that they will no longer resist its evidence. The meaning is, that He shall convince men of something hitherto unknown ; and all the three members of the sentence are linked together as follows: He shall convince men in respect to the fact that they believe not on me ; in other words, He will demonstrate to the mind that unbelief is a sin—yea, the greatest sin ; He shall convince the world of righteousness in respect to the fact that a true and proper righteousness has been wrought out for men by Christ's suffering and death ; He shall convince the world of judgment in respect to the fact that Satan has at the great tribunal lost his cause, and is denuded of the right which he previously possessed. The efficient cause of all these effects is the personal Holy Ghost, the Comforter, and the Spirit of truth.</p>
      <p> Christ's own  words, as here recorded on  the  convincing</p>
      
      <p> work of the Comforter, is the  locus classicus  to which all fitly turn, whenever discussion is raised or inquiry awakened, as to the way in which the Spirit applies redemption : "  and ivlien He is come He will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment " (John xvi. 8). As to the nature of that convincing influence which the Spirit brings to bear upon the mind, several things come under our consideration. He sets forth truth to the mind, and maintains it against every prepossession or contrary opinion. The Holy Spirit, by the word alone, or through the ministry of those who preach it, convinces the un believing world by the prophecies of the Old Testament,— by the testimonies of the New Testament,—by law and by gospel,—so fitly and seasonably, that the unwilling are made willing, and compelled to feel and to admit in their con science the truth of the gospel—an impression which is followed by faith in the heart and confession with the mouth. They are pressed by the force of truth, and yield. More particularly, He convinces the mind in  A THREEFOLD WAY,  viz. that unbelief is the greatest sin ; that the righteous ness procured by Christ is the only righteousness which avails before God; and that all the right or claim which Satan had to the possession of man, once his captive but now redeemed, is so invalidated—because the process has been decided against him—that he cannot tyrannize over any but by their own will.</p>
      <p> Let me briefly notice the several objects in reference to which the Spirit yields His convincing influence.</p>
      <p> 1. The first object is  UNBELIEF,  the sin of contravening and rejecting the proposals of the gospel. The Redeemer, the true interpreter of His own words, subjoined what sin He meant when He added : " In respect to the fact that they believe not on me." This explanation by the Lord Himself refutes the opinion of Piscator and others, that the allusion is to His crucifixion by the Jews, as well as another opinion,</p>
      
      <p> that the expression must be generally understood of every sin committed. These interpreters are all of the class who hold that the verb which we render " convince" must have the meaning of " reprove," and will not admit the exegetical or specifying force of the particle (ort), which we have rendered " in respect to the fact that." But the Lord's meaning is express, pointing to the sin of unbelief, which, abstractly considered, is a violation of a divine command, and, concretely considered, is a refusal to accept the merits of a divine Eedeemer.</p>
      <p> To understand the criminality of unbelief, it may be remarked that it contracts guilt from the law, as the latter pronounces condemnation generally on all disobedience to the expressed will of God. The law may be taken in a twofold way—that is, as having a general and a special use. The first table of the law condemns generally all unbelief toward the word of God, and charges it as sin.</p>
      <p> To be more explicit, let me add that the gospel has its own rule in reference to its own  credenda,  or things to be believed. There an object of faith is presented to our view, with a special rule or mode divinely prescribed for apprehending it; and, according to this rule, the man must act who wishes to be saved. To that rule or mode many of the names applied to faith are found to have respect. Thus it is called God's commandment (1 John iii. 23), the way of righteousness (2 Pet. ii. 21), the law of faith (Bom. iii. 27;, the work of God (John vi. 29), and compliance with it is called obedience to the faith (Eom. i. 5). In all these passages allusion is clearly made to that rule, way, or method by which the blessings of redemption are applied and conferred. But, on the contrary, he who contravenes that rule, and refuses to walk in that way, incurs the guilt of disobedience. Not only so : when unbelief, which is just an act in opposition to the tenor of the gospel, is persistently and resolutely carried out, the law comes forth to fulminate against it.</p>
      <p> M</p>
      
      <p> The sin of unbelief is here described, with all the enormous guilt attaching to it, as a rejection of the proposals of recon ciliation, as the chief and the supreme sin, because a sin against the remedy,—as sinful in itself, and as preventing the remission of all other sins. As unbelief is the sin by eminence, it is upon this that the convincing influence of the Spirit is mainly brought to bear.</p>
      <p> Considered in its consequences, this sin of unbelief has its immediate ground of condemnation in the fact that all other sins, original and actual, with all their guilt, are remissible through faith in Christ. But this sin involves the rejection of the graciously provided remedy; and final unbelief has nothing to interpose between the sinner and righteous con demnation. Hence Luther was wont to affirm that unbelief alone condemns, since it makes the person evil and the works evil</p>
      <p> The sin of unbelief is here described as if it were the only sin, because, according to the happy remark of Augustin, while it continues, all other sins are retained, and when it departs all other sins are remitted. Not only so : it con stantly produces new sins. For, as faith may be considered either as it apprehends Christ or as it works by love, unbelief in like manner may be considered either as refusing Christ's redeeming work, or as it works by sin against the conscience. Unbelief may be called the mother sin, because it not only leaves all guilt remaining, but gives force to reigning sins, and origin to a polluted conscience. But however great and perilous this sin may be, such is the ignorance in which men naturally are involved, that  its criminality is totally unknown till it is brought home by the  CONVINCING INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST  the Comforter. Conscience may convince men of ordinary sins, but never of the sin of unbelief. Of the enormity of this sin no man was ever convinced but by the Holy Ghost Himself.</p>
      <p> 2. The   second   object   of   which   they  are   convinced   is</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   179</p>
      <p> RIGHTEOUSNESS,  which is immediately after the former brought before the mind in order to prevent despair. This expression must not be understood as meaning that He who was crucified on the charge of sedition and blasphemy is proved to be innocent and righteous. That interpretation is supported by ingenious arguments, and specially by this, that God vindicated His innocence by raising Him from the dead ; but it is by no means suited to the context. For, when Christ promises the Comforter to convince them of the sin of unbelief, He must be understood as meaning unbelief as to His Messiahship and saving work, and not merely as to His being a righteous man. The first clause presupposes that He is a Saviour, and so must the second. .To convince the world of righteousness, must mean that the Spirit gives convincing evidence, not merely that His cause is good, and that He is innocent, but that in Him is found the righteousness which the world needs, the imputed righteousness which was graciously provided for us and becomes ours by faith.</p>
      <p> When it is added :  He slwll convince tlu world of righteous ness, in respect to the fact tlmt I go to the Father, and ye see me no more,  we see that the righteousness is equivalent to an obedience which culminated in suffering and death, and not an infused righteousness, as the Romanists allege; nor God's essential righteousness, as was alleged by Osiander, and as is re-echoed by the modern Plymouthists.</p>
      <p> According to the correct interpretation of Luther and the great divines of the Lutheran Church, the meaning is: " By my departure—that is, by my death and sufferings—a valid righteousness has been procured for all true believers ;" for all the actions of Him who is by eminence the Servant of the Lord are at once mediatorial and redeeming. The figure is taken from a returning exile or traveller who has been from home; and in this case from the end of that work of abase ment, or atonement and expiation, for the completion of which He had come forth from the Father (John xvi. 28).</p>
      
      <p> The same style of language had been several times used before, not only to the disciples (John xiii. 33), but on previous occasions to the Jews (John vii. 34, viii. 21). This whole style of language presupposes a commission or office to be discharged, a coming forth from the Father to perform it, and a return with all the demonstrations of acceptance to Him who sent Him. The language implies all Christ's offices, but especially His meritorious work as the Servant of the Lord and the High Priest of our profession (Heb. iii. 1). The additional words: "and ye shall see me no more," are a mere supplement to the previous thought, conveying little more than a filling up of the description by a reference to the mental state of the disciples, who must needs prepare themselves for losing that visible intercourse and that exchange of thought and speech in which they had found their satisfaction. But the appended phrase is a mere adjunct, and no constituent of the righteousness such as the previous clause involves, the allusion being merely to the apostles.</p>
      <p> This language intimates that the righteousness which avails with God consists not, as the Eomanist will have it, in that which is infused, nor in the mere act of faith regarded as our obedience, as the Arminian will have it,—but in His going to the Father by His meritorious and atoning death. It implies that He who was sent on such an errand, and who returned with all the tokens of cordial welcome and great reward, must have brought in the everlasting righteousness and sealed up the vision and prophecy (Dan. ix. 24). But of that righteousness the world must be  CONVINCED,  if it is to be of any value to the sons of men. It must be duly announced or testified by apostles orally and in writing, and by the Holy Ghost the Comforter inwardly (John xv. 26, 27). Hence it is said that the Holy Ghost is sent to convince the world of this everlasting or imputed righteousness—that is, to show men that they who are denuded of any proper righteous-</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   181</p>
      <p> ness should, without delay, avail themselves of that which has magnified the law and made it honourable.</p>
      <p> 3. The third object of which the world is convinced by the Comforter is  JUDGMENT.  This benefit stands very closely related to the former. The righteousness which Christ acquired by His going to the Father, as already ex plained, and which is applied by imputation to all them that believe, puts them in a friendly relation to God, and God in a friendly relation to them, because they are righteous in Christ's righteousness; and this is the reason why our Lord immediately subjoins the mention of judgment. In due order, and based upon the former, conies deliverance from Satan.</p>
      <p> As to the  JUDGMENT  here mentioned, it is not to be inter preted as meaning the authority which Christ, as victor over Satan, and accepted Surety, wields as supreme Lord of heaven and earth. That view, embodying a precious truth, is too general here, and misses the point of the clause, though held by Chrysostom, Cyrill, Piscator, and many recent commenta tors. Obviously, the import of the words does not refer to what is deposited in Christ as a potentate, able to disarm the strong man armed, but to what was inflicted on Satan, when the cause which was before the supreme tribunal for final adjudication was decided against him. The work of the second Adam, satisfying every claim of law and justice, terminated Satan's right, and reversed his authority acquired by conquest. We are led to this conclusion, as in the two previous clauses, by the exegetical or specifying particle (6'rt), which must still have the same meaning, and only declare what had been yet but obscurely expressed. It is but one thing, only more fully declared. It is not statement and reason of the statement, as given in the English Authorized Version. The meaning is as follows : He shall convince the world of judg ment  in respect to the fact that the prince of the world has been judged.  The use of the perfect passive (/ceK/omu) intimates</p>
      
      <p> that it was within a few hours—that it was as good as done, —a mode of speech l&gt;y no means uncommon in our Lord's style (see John xii. 31). The meaning is, that Satan has been judged in the sense that the great cause has gone against him, and that he has no more right to retain the world, which he previously held by right of conquest.</p>
      <p> What is  THIS WORLD,  and who is its prince ? It is not the fabric of the universe, which God created, upholds, and rules ; but the world of men seduced by the tempter, and held by a certain claim of right; his subjects and his sons doing the lusts of their father (Eph. ii. 2 ; John viii. 44). The phraseology is borrowed from a legal proceeding carried on by two contending parties—Satan, on the one side, con tending that he had a right of property in men who had become his subjects; that a rebel cannot be restored to favour, but must be left in his hands; that the highly extolled rectitude of the supreme Judge must carry out the same sentence on men that had been carried out, and was for ever to be carried out, on himself;—the Mediator, on the other side, appealing to the fact that, as He took man's place under the broken law to fulfil its obligations and bear its penalty in their room, justice as well as mercy required that Satan's right of conquest should be reversed, and the world given to Him who was its second Adam and Lord of all. Such was the cause to be finally and irrevocably decided, and, on the ground of Christ's satisfaction and sufficient ransom, the adjudication was rightfully decided against the prince of this world, who was to be cast out of his dominions and compelled to surrender the world—that is, the human family—into other hands. He can no longer keep his goods in peace when the stronger than he appears upon the scene (Luke xi. 21 ; Isa. xlix. 24 ; 1 Cor. xv. 54). Of all this,  THE HOLY GHOST THE COMFORTER COMES TO CON VINCE  THE HEARERS OF THE GOSPEL, to whom the apostles testified (John xv. 26, 27). Men are thus convinced that</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   183</p>
      <p> they may be free indeed (John viii. 36), no more subjects of the tempter, no more bound to obey him, but loyal subjects of Christ, and made willing in a day of His power (Ps. ex. 3).</p>
      <p> As to the issue of this convincing process, exegetes are by no means at one. Many who are correct in expounding the term " convince " assume unwarrantably a twofold result, and assert that it may sometimes end in the obdurate mind and sometimes in saving faith. Even Calvin arrives at the conclusion, that under the term  WORLD  may be comprehended an allusion to hypocrites and reprobates as well as to those who are truly to be converted. Tholuck, after putting-together a variety of opinions, comes to no firm decision. On the other hand, practical writers and preachers, weighing the passage in its bearings upon religious experience, come, for the most part, to the conclusion that the result of this convincing process ends in true conversion. I cannot but regard that as the only true and legitimate interpretation.</p>
      <p> As so much uncertainty prevails, I have gone into a full consideration of this passage, with all the light reflected from the history of interpretation, believing that this was by no means unnecessary. My full persuasion is, that  THE CON VINCING PROCESS OF THE SPIRIT,  thus described by Christ in the last evening of His intercourse with the disciples, is so put as to bring out the successive steps, or the order of salva tion, through which the Spirit leads the awakened mind; and that we can only view it as issuing in a sound conver sion. I hold that it means to convince by clear and cogent arguments. It brings the ruin and the remedy together. It is a thunderbolt against all the views of Legalists.</p>
      <p> We shall next consider Christ's testimony to the blasphemy or sin against the Holy Ghost. "  lV7wsoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not "be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come"  (Matt. xii. 32). On the occasion of healing a demoniac, the Pharisees wished to</p>
      
      <p> invalidate the proof of Christ's divine mission by the allega tion that the miracle was not performed by the finger of God, but by Beelzebul, the prince of the devils. "Without explicitly stating that they had committed, or were commit ting, the sin against the Holy Ghost, He gives them a solemn warning that there is a sin against the Holy Ghost which is unpardonable. He speaks absolutely of an irremissible sin; for all other sin can be remitted on the ground of Christ's satisfaction through faith and repentance. But with the solemnity of an oath by Himself, as the " verily verily" indicates, He declares that this sin has no forgiveness.</p>
      <p> As to the nature of this sin against the Holy Ghost, it is shrouded in a certain mystery, but it is neither calculated nor intended to give perplexity to any Christian mind. It may be difficult to define it; and the most conflicting opinions were entertained among the ancient Fathers, and downwards from the Reformation times. Thus Tertullian, Hilary, and other Fathers maintained that the sin against the Spirit meant blasphemy, not against the human nature of Christ, which is pardonable, but against His divine nature, which is unpardon able. Cyprian explained it of apostasy, or the denial of Christ, and consequently held that the lapsed could scarcely, if at all, be forgiven. Origen expounded the passage of those sins which are committed subsequent to baptism. But these essentially Novatian comments, when fully carried out, come into collision with the Creed, which declares: " I believe in the forgiveness of sins." Athanasius is not consistent with himself. "We may perhaps distribute the vast variety of interpretations scattered over the works of expositors, and over the theological systems of divines, into the three following classes:—</p>
      <p> 1. Those which virtually make it a sin possible only when Christ was among men in the exercise of His personal ministry. Chrysostom and Jerome explain it as if our Lord meant to say: he that speaks against the Son of man, regard-</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   185</p>
      <p> ing Him as nothing more than man, may obtain forgiveness; but he who ascribes these miracles to Satan, while discerning in them the indications of divine power, shall never be for given ; for this is the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost, by whom Christ performed His mighty deeds. Pfaff and Klinkenberg, in last century, strongly asserted that interpretation.</p>
      <p> 2.   Another view propounded by Augustin makes the sin against the Holy Ghost equivalent to final impenitence.    A very large class of writers in all ages have held this view as  the  simplest and  least   complicated.      The   followers   of Melanchthon in the Lutheran Church, many of our Scotch divines,—such as Guthrie in his   Trial of a Saving Interest, Chalmers, and others,—as well as writers in all countries who have followed Augustin, have accepted this comment as the best.</p>
      <p> 3.   Calvin,   dissenting   from   Augustin's   view   because   it seemed not to do justice to the peculiar expression, that this sin shall not be forgiven  either in this world or in that which is to come,  held that it is resistance to the truth conjoined with malice, though the evidence in behalf of the truth of the Christian faith was such as rendered it impossible to plead ignorance.    The thought is supposed to be, that this sin is committed before the close of life, and while the person has still a period to live in this world.    And it  is alleged that the distinguishing mark of this sin is conscious resistance or deliberate opposition to conclusive evidence supplied by the Spirit of God.    The men who commit this sin are thought to be convinced of the truth of the Christian religion, and yet oppose and blaspheme it, not so much from sudden passion and the  force of temptation, as  from wilful  malice.     It is argued  that while God gives pardon to all  manner of sin through the exercise of faith and repentance, the sin against the Holy Ghost is unique and irremissible, because conscious resistance is present to the mind, and because the voluntary</p>
      
      <p> denial of divine truth is combined with hatred and malice. This opinion of Calvin was adopted with a very general consent by the subsequent divines of the Reformed Church. If I were to adduce a  catena  of Reformed divines, they would be found almost uniformly to follow Calvin's opinion, and frequently with an exaggerated statement both of the extent of a gracious work of the Spirit on such minds, and of the almost Satanic character of their conscious resistance. This comes out in such writers as Maresius, Maestricht, Cocceius, Hoornbeck, and others.</p>
      <p> One guiding principle, however, against excess of statement is supplied by the fact that the evidence furnished by the Spirit, and resisted by those who so sin against Him, is  ONLY</p>
      <p> HIS    TESTIMONY,   not    HlS   WORK   ON   THE   HEART;   for  (1)   the</p>
      <p> latter is irresistible; and (2) he that hath begun a good work will perform it. Whatever evidence is brought to bear on the mind, it is but rational conviction derived from testimony, not the efficacious change of heart. And this enables us to draw a line between the Lutheran and Reformed exposition of this topic. The Lutheran exposition holds that only the regenerate are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost. So Gerhard, Balduin, Hiilsemanu, Quenstedt, and all their eminent divines speak. On the contrary, the canons of the Synod of Dort, giving as they do the most admirably correct expression of all the doctrines of special grace, include among the errors which are to be rejected, the opinion that the regenerate may be guilty of this sin.</p>
      <p> It is commonly held that this is the same sin that is referred to by the sacred writers in those other passages of Scripture (Heb. vi. 4-G, x. 29 ; 1 John v. 10). It is true Athanasius, Basil, Jerome do not regard these passages in the Epistle to the Hebrews and in John as referring to the sin against the Holy Ghost. Calvin says: " The apostle agrees with the Master."</p>
      <p> I have given the principal opinions on  this unpardonable</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   187</p>
      <p> sin, and endeavoured to distribute them into three classes. For my own part, I incline to Augustin's opinion; at all events, I am convinced that the notion of  FINAL IMPENITENCE must be taken along with us as a main element in any opinion which may be adopted or maintained on this subject.</p>
      <p> The Spirit inhabits and replenishes all the mental powers, and supplies them with the help which makes them fit for active service. Discussions have long been carried on as to the relation and priority of the understanding and will, and as to the influence which the one may be regarded as exercising on the other. Without complicating our inquiry, as is too frequently done, both on the Calvinistic and Arminian side, with discussions which yield no satisfactory result as to the priority of the understanding and its neces sary influence on the will, we may better describe the change which is effected by regeneration as taking effect ON  ALL THE POWERS  OF  THE  SOUL, and as underlying the exercise of them all. We consider it as displaying its various modes of activity, as so many phenomena in the compass of all the several faculties in all that constitutes the truly Christian life; and we would rather speak of what is natural and intelligible, viz. of the entire soul found in various conditions and moods, than separate the mental powers into so many divisions or compart ments, each acting upon the other, and opening the gateway for the other. If the entire soul is a unity and only found in certain states of mind, as Witsius was wont to represent it in theology, and as Brown was wont to represent it in philosophy, we may more fitly describe the Spirit's operations  as taking effect on the whole soul,  than limit ourselves to one faculty acting on another.</p>
      <p> The restoration of the Spirit takes for granted that He comes in  TO INHABIT THE WHOLE MAN,  according to the idea of anthropology, with which all Scripture is replete, and becomes anew for us the indefectible source of light and life and fruit-fulness, as well as of perseverance and progressive holiness.</p>
      
      <p> The allusions to the inhabitation of the Spirit are manifold and various. As a new impelling power, He occupies the human faculties, and so pervades them that He is said to dwell in us and walk in us (2 Cor. vi. 16) ; and the regenerate man is said to  HAVE  the Spirit of Christ as the consequence of that gracious inhabitation. The Spirit condescends to occupy all the chambers of our hearts, and to dwell in them.</p>
      <p> We may trace the Spirit's work on  THE MENTAL POWERS, and show that there is a divine influence decisive as to the action of them all. A single glance at the Spirit's operation on the understanding, will, and conscience, will suffice to show that, in the case of the regenerate, the Holy Spirit is</p>
      <p> *  O  &lt;/   i.</p>
      <p> the efficient cause of all their spiritual activity.</p>
      <p> With regard to the  UNDERSTANDING,  all spiritual light is derived from the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the know ledge of the Lord Jesus enlightening the eyes of their under standing (Eph. i. 17). When the question is raised, Does the illumination belong solely to prevenient grace ? it is necessary to distinguish. In the first act of illumination, the Spirit acts much in the same way as when He commanded it to shine out of darkness (2 Cor. iv. 6). But when the man has received the power of vision, he uses it for the further increase of his knowledge in the way of co-operating grace. The truths which he believed to the saving of the soul had reference to God, to himself, and to the adaptation of the atonement. By the illumination of the Spirit, he acquires wholly different views of all these points and of God, who is no longer regarded as an indulgent being, nor as a tyrant, but as a gracious Father, all whose perfections are glorified by the atonement. And as to ourselves, He shows us the ruin and the remedy.</p>
      <p> The Spirit's operation is not less conspicuous on the  WILL. The principal effect of the Spirit's activity is seen in a new principle of spiritual life diffused through all the mental powers, and inclining the soul to yield itself to Christ in the</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   189</p>
      <p> exercise of faith and subjection, as now enabled or made fit both to will and to do.</p>
      <p> And as to the  CONSCIENCE,  the sanctification of the Spirit contributes to a good conscience. In other words, the con science purged with the sprinkling of the blood of Christ by the effectual application of the Spirit, is committed to the Spirit, who corrects and teaches it, who purifies and comforts it, from day to day.</p>
      <p> II. The effectually called become  ADOPTED SONS,  and are translated by the power of the Spirit into the family of God, according to the canon, that whatever is imparted in the exercise of Christ's grace implies the opposite in our state by nature, they who were born into God's family were in the opposite family—in the family of Satan—before.</p>
      <p> It is the more necessary to set this in its proper light, because many do not hesitate to say, under the bias of a false system, that God is universal Father, and that all men are His children. They hold  THE FATHERHOOD OF GOD  in virtue of an alleged unbroken relation formed by creation, and that all men, without exception or distinction, belong to the family of God, much in the same way as Pope expresses it in his universal prayer. Children, forsooth, who only disobey and dishonour their Father ! No: all men by nature belong to a family antagonistic to the family of God, and do the lusts of a father described as a liar and murderer from the beginning. That is a position in harmony with the doctrine of Christ and His apostles. Men cannot, at one and the same moment, be of their father the devil, as Cain was (1 John iv. 10—12), and as the Jews were, when our Lord declared to them their family (John viii. 44), and be recognised or called the sons of God. The whole doctrine of our Lord and His apostles sets forth that sinners and all unregenerate men are children of the evil one.</p>
      <p> Though the doctrine of human depravity was not represented by the early Christian writers, especially of the</p>
      
      <p> Greek Church, with all the accuracy with which they were delineated in after times, it must be admitted that these early writers speak of men as subjected to the evil power with a Biblical fulness and accuracy to which modern theology can make no pretensions. They lay emphasis on  THE POWER OF SATAN.  The representations given in the early Christian literature as to the sinful power under which the human race lias fallen, may be described as greatly more full and sugges tive than in the literature of the present day. "With regard to Satan that is emphatically true. AVith the Christian Church in post-apostolic times Satan was a reality, and his kingdom a fact, with which they daily felt themselves encompassed. The Fathers cannot find terms sufficiently strong to delineate the power of Satan, the seductive influence which he wields, and the subjection to his dominion under which men have fallen. In a word, the Patristic literature gives the utmost prominence to the terrible power and tyranny of Satan, though by no means greater than the subject warrants; and this subjection is always traced to sin. There is no disposition with them to shrink from representing men as children of the wicked one.</p>
      <p> In the translation of the individual from the one family to the other, it must be borne in mind that the Spirit is repre sented in Scripture as the great agent. He makes Christ and His people one, for the acceptance of their persons and the renovation of their natures. I refer to this the rather because there are schools of theology which make  the work of the Spirit and the commencement of His operations subsequent to the believing reception of Christ;  and many, under the spell of a theory from which they never escape, make the participation of the Redeemer's work turn in the last resort on the self-application of the individual; and setting out from the universal call of the gospel, they look with suspicion on any express allusion either to human inability or to the effectual applica tion of the Spirit. But the language of Scripture in reference</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   191</p>
      <p> to this application is so express as to leave no room for a moment's hesitation. Thus, if we consider any aspect of the question, the Spirit is said to shed abroad the love of God upon the heart, which must be taken  as the decisive turning-point  in that application (Eom. v. 5). The Holy Spirit is designated " the Spirit of adoption,"—a phrase which, accord ing to the analogy supplied by every similar expression, means that He is the author of the adoption (Eom. viii. 15). The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause in communicating the bless ings of redemption ; for the merits of Christ and the efficacy of the Spirit are placed together in the inseparable connection which follows: " But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor. vi. 11). When the gospel pro duces saving effects, it is said to come not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost (1 Thess. i. 5). The sancti-fication of the Spirit is inserted by Paul and Peter as the intermediate link between election on the part of God and faith on the part of man (2 Thess. ii. 13). The Apostle Peter declares that men are chosen by the separation which the Spirit produces to the belief of the truth and to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ (1 Pet. i. 2). But there is one title of the Spirit which is peculiarly significant and suggestive in this light— THE SPIRIT OF FAITH  ; that is, the author of faith (2 Cor. iv. 13), by whom we call Jesus Lord, and confide in Him. The conclusion to which we come, from these testimonies, is, that in the application of redemption there is but one great agent,—not the force of human will, according to the semi-Pelagian opinion,—not a double factor, according to the Synergistic theory. The sole cause is the Holy Spirit operating through the word—that is, by the pro clamation of law and gospel by which He enlightens the understanding, and inclines the will to receive Christ's finished work.</p>
      <p> The  ADOPTION OF  SONS, into which Christians are ushered</p>
      
      <p> by the Spirit (Rom. viii. 15), differs from the privilege of justification in this respect, that it brings the Christian before God in the new relation of a child to a father. Whether we regard this state of sonship, with many divines, as one of the sides of justification, or as a further privilege into which the believer passes without any interval of time,  THE ADOPTION OF SONS  (vtoOearla)  is, in a doctrinal point of view, of the utmost moment in the organism of divine truth, because it preserves the equipoise, and prevents the juridical idea from being exclusive. As it is set forth by the apostles, we find adoption in  THREE  several delineations : (I) Paul describes the privilege of sons as contrasted with the position of a servant (Gal. iv. 7); (2) John describes adoption in connection with regeneration, and with the underlying truth that we are made sons by grace because Christ is the Son by nature (John i. 13 ; 1 John iii. 1) ; (3) the Synoptists, preserving our Lord's words, describe adoption in connection with the restoration of the divine image (Matt. v. 45). We have only to put together that threefold description of the apostles as the complement of each other, to give an exhaustive outline of the whole doctrine of adoption.</p>
      <p> The justified person, passing into the relation of a son, enters into a relation of love, which we shall delineate in a few particulars. (1) The foundation of sonship is based in the incarnation of the eternal Son, who became the Son of man, and partaker of flesh and blood, that His people might become the sons of God. It is not some merely imvard change produced by the operations of the Spirit that the Father loves;  He, loves them in His Son,  and extends to them the same complacency and favour which rest on Him. This is the great objective ground of their adoption and of their joint participation of that love wherewith He loves the Son, as far as a created being, in virtue of the federal and vital union, can share it. (2) The receptive hand by which Christians are made partakers of sonship and joint participants of the</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   193</p>
      <p> Holy Ghost, according to their measure, is  FAITH,  and the accompanying union which true faith involves. (3) The adoption common to believers, and essentially the same in all, has no varying degrees, but one equal degree wherever it is found, and it is perfect at once. " Now are we the sons of God" (1 John iii. 2). Hence no warrant exists for the opinion that there are distinctions or varying degrees in the love of God to His adopted children so far as this objective privilege is concerned ; for on each of them rests that divine complacency which rests on the only-begotten Son. This adoption carries with it demonstrations of divine love, pledges of paternal care and salutary discipline, as well as foretastes of glory, honour, and immortality, and conformity to the image of Him who is the first-born among many brethren. (4) It is a privilege about which the Christian, replenished by the Holy Spirit, is to be left in no uncertainty and doubt, for the Spirit makes intercession with groanings that cannot be uttered, and bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God (Bom. viii. 16). On this central point of Biblical doctrine many divines expatiate, some in one interest, some in another, in order, if possible, to find a remedy for those controversies and debates that have long been carried on as to the matter of a sinner's acceptance. Thiersch, in the erudite lectures in which he discusses the principles of Catholicism and Protestantism, speaks of this doctrine as furnishing a sort of meeting-point, and proposes an  irenicum on this basis of agreement. He goes so far as to say that the Romish doctrine, antagonistic to the position that all believers are equally accepted on the ground of the Redeemer's merits, is really met by this doctrine of adoption as a common basis of agreement.</p>
      <p> The doctrine of assurance, or the witness of the Spirit, connected with the adoption of sons, demands a few words of exposition (Rom. viii. 16). This witness is spoken of as the well-known accompaniment of adoption. And as the result</p>
      <p> N</p>
      
      <p> of the Holy Spirit's operations, we cannot suppose that the testimony of the Spirit, of which the Apostle Paul speaks, was  AN EXTRAORDINARY INWARD REVELATION,  imparted only to apostles and to a few specially selected individuals of the apostolic age, as Romish divines are in the habit of affirming, but as a common Christian experience. It is not an excep tional gift, but the ordinary criterion and accompaniment of adoption. The notion, however, that he is no true Christian who does not enjoy an ever-shining assurance, as an unclouded sun in the firmament, has as little to say in its defence. The possibility of attaining assurance, and the duty of possessing it (potcst d dcbct\  must be inculcated. But beyond that we are not warranted to go, and may not presume to go.</p>
      <p> The subject of assurance was so identified with faith in the theology of the Reformation as to be well-nigh inseparable and indistinguishable; and the Puritan doctrine may be called an advance to a clearer view. While these divines carefully distinguished it from faith, they contended that, in God's design, and according to the constitution of things, assurance could neither be retained in an unholy walk, nor emerge upon the consciousness apart from the Spirit's testimony and the renovated will. While they directed the eye of faith to the all-sufficiency of the Redeemer in a way not differing from the Reformers, they suspended assurance neither upon joyous emotions of acceptance alone, nor on the immediate revelation of the Spirit alone, irrespective of the graces of the new creation. And in one of the most precious chapters of the Confession, they have set forth their conclusion. In their day they furnished a corrective to an  excess.  An equally great  defect  required to be supplied in the following century, of which Warburton was a representative divine, when it was necessary to exhibit assurance as an incumbent duty, and as a benefit productive of higher holiness and deeper love, as well as of a consecrated life. Venn represents it as one great cause of Wesley's success, that he urged</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   195</p>
      <p> Christians not to rest without joy in God from receiving the atonement.</p>
      <p> I cannot omit to notice, in this connection, the fact that, according to the uniform testimony of history, all success in extending religion, and in promoting its revival, has been always connected with dependence on the Spirit of life, and that the refusal to regard the Spirit as the author of conver sion and the source of spiritual life, puts a Church or an individual beyond the pale of the truly Christian. Such a religion has no claim to be classed among evangelical com munions. A religion not acting in the Spirit as the principle of action, can only be the religion of nature. The essential feature of Christianity, according to our Lord's own delinea tion, is the new birth ; and so indispensable is it, that with out the new nature there can be no evangelical health or progress, nor any interest in Christ and in the blessings of His purchase.</p>
      <p> To go back to the Lutheran type of doctrine,—the eldest daughter of the Eeformation,—we find that this Church was well-nigh stranded when the Synergistic controversy took its rise within her pale. Whoever has bestowed any attention on that discussion, is aware that nothing but the profound views already lodged in the mind of the Christian community on the vast ruin of the fall, and on the indispensable necessity of the efficacious grace of the Holy Spirit, at that time saved the life of the Church. The majority maintained, agreeably to Scripture, that the natural man, apart from what the Holy Spirit does in Him, can do absolutely nothing, and that he needs to be replenished by the Spirit of life. The Church righted again by adopting the position that  the subject of conversion cannot also lie a co-operating factor,  and that the sole cause of conversion and faith is the Holy Spirit working through the word—that is, as giving a full proclamation of law and gospel. Ko Protestant Confession has assigned any agency for the human will as a  THIRD CAUSE  ; for to do so were</p>
      
      <p> to fall into the logical absurdity of confounding the subject of conversion with its cause. To show the dangers of Synergism, we quote a sentence from a German writer : " This article," says he, 1  " did not fail to exercise a leavening influence both in a forward and backward direction,—backward, on the doctrine of original sin; forward, on that of justification." We believe that this is the inevitable consequence, as a few words will show.</p>
      <p> With regard to the first, the doctrine of  ORIGINAL SIN,  it is obvious that a theory which asserts a synergism, and by this means qualifies the sole operation of the Holy Spirit, does not presuppose a human nature which is subjected to such a moral change as is seen in the issue of the fall. The  rationale  of every gospel doctrine, and, in a particular manner, of the Spirit's operations, is furnished by clear discoveries as to the extent of inherent depravity. And to assume a doctrine of original sin less than coextensive with the essential powers of the soul,—though it has left that essence undestroyed, and still capable of extrication from the ruin,—is to neutralize the provisions of the Holy Spirit's work.</p>
      <p> Not only so; the effect of synergistic views on man's JUSTIFICATION  by imputed righteousness is not less disastrous. It is an attempt, as futile as foolish, to accept a surety-righteous ness and repudiate a surety-strength, exercised upon man by the omnipotent efficacy of the Holy Spirit, when not an argu ment can be adduced against the one but may equally be directed against the other. And hence Luther said, with his iisual vehemence: " What need of God, what need of Christ, what need of the Spirit, if free-will can accomplish all ?" The entire success in the last resort is made to hinge on the individual himself.</p>
      <p> With others in this age, and they are a very numerous class, all the application of redemption is resolved into the exercise of natural power as the effect of mere moral suasion. 1  Schuliring in Rudelbach's  Zeltschriftfiir Luthfrische Theologie,  1848, p. 316.</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   197</p>
      <p> The man is thrown back on himself. It seems to exalt and flatter man's nature, but it paves the way for its deeper degradation. Here I may notice that Amyraldus has been followed by not a few in the unhappy distinction which he drew between the physical and moral ability to believe in Christ. He asserted that man had the former, though he had not the latter. That notion of ability, copiously imported into America, gave rise to many ill-considered state ments which can only be received with caution. Whatever system leaves human nature as it is, to make the best of its resources, or to be wrought upon merely by a class of motives, though the most sublime, but which introduce no new element into fallen humanity, is as little Christian in its essence as it is stale and flat in its conception. If man's soul is not to be elevated from its degradation by the regenerating grace of the Spirit, which alone can raise it, but flattered with its ability and power,—if nothing but a class of motives, higher indeed than Plato's, but yet mere motives, is brought to bear upon it, no high conception is formed of the trans forming influence of Christianity. That system of moral suasion often imposes on its own advocates: it seems so con structed as to avoid the outward appearance of Pelagianism, because it limits the view merely to the matter of accepting salvation as a gift. But it is only in appearance, and not in essence, that it evades the grosser form of Pelagianism, by limiting the language to the reception of a gift. Thus, while there are schools of theology, such as the Puritans and Jansenists, which have endeavoured to vindicate the spiritual life as a reality, the views in question contribute directly, and not in their remote effect, to obliterate all the distinction between spirit and flesh, grace and nature. Of the fruits of Naturalism, under whatever form it appears, whether it be Pelagianism, Arminianism, Socinianism, Rationalism, we have seen enough in the history of the Church to be convinced that it does not tend, with all its high praise of man's ability</p>
      
      <p> and dignity, to elevate our race. If all good flows from the Spirit of God, down to the very first desire, then dependence and prayer constitute the only fitting attitude.</p>
      <p> The leading principle which helps us to find our way through all the difficulties of these questions is, that  THE SPIRIT,  in His return to the human heart,  ANTICIPATES THE WILL —that is, works in us to will, at the first moment of conversion and at every subsequent step. The first desire, wish, or resolution to return to God, as well as the first prayer offered with this end in view, is from the Holy Spirit. That all spiritual good emanates from the Spirit of God, is a simple formula, which keeps every inquirer in this depart ment right. That the Spirit's power and grace precede the will is a maxim to be carried with us, unless we are prepared to ascribe a merit to the first step, or to view the first step as originated on the man's own side.</p>
      <p> And from the moment that the soul begins to act in spiritual things, it acts with its newly acquired spiritual powers, imparted by the Spirit of God. The Spirit's opera tion,  always spoken of in the present tense,  and as prevenient grace, prompts the soul to co-operate with its newly acquired powers of life. But the expression  SPIRITUAL POWERS  does not imply a change on man's essential nature, or the donation of faculties which were never found in the human mind before, but simply a new aptitude and power to comply with what is truly good, as derived from the Holy Spirit. With a new will, that is, a will renovated and endowed with a spiritual capacity, the soul becomes active, and co-operates with God.</p>
      <p> We have thus seen that the application of redemption is from first to last by the Holy Spirit; that the faith by which we receive the adoption of sons is the first point; and that this faith in man's heart is only from the Spirit of God, which is the second point. If there be admitted any natural power or capacity in man for the exercise of faith, this necessarily overthrows in the second instance the great doctrine of divine</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   199</p>
      <p> grace that was announced in the first. This doctrine of the Spirit, therefore, really maintains, more than anything else, a Church's connection with evangelical religion; and where this is wanting, nothing can intercept or arrest a Church's descent to the lowest depths of naturalism. The Wesleyan system, when it diverged from the path which Whitfield continued to maintain, imbibed most of the Arminian tenets; but it was rescued from the irreparable ruin that had otherwise awaited it by the fact that it unequivocally recognised the Holy Spirit as the sole author of regeneration and of spiritual life ; for Wesley said with unhesitating decision : " There is no more  of power  than of merit in man; but as all merit is in the Son of God, so all power is in the Spirit of God; and therefore every man, in order to believe unto salvation, must receive the Holy Ghost." They conceded too much as to the extent of the Spirit's operations, but they retained what was essential to spiritual life. But the theology that contemplates nothing higher than moral suasion and free-will, and which repudiates the supernatural, is necessarily divested of all evangelical power as well as of all permanence and strength. The current objection to the Spirit's work, that man must have inherent strength to believe, because divine wrath rests on those who do not believe, is but a plausible sophism. If it had any meaning, it would be as applicable to the law as to faith, and to the work of Christ as \vell as to the work of the Spirit. If a man must have power in the one case, he must have power in the other case. He who vindicates the Mediator's work against the sceptic or Deist, cannot without the most flagrant inconsistency take Pelagian ground against the Spirit's work. There is not an argument against the one that is not equally capable of being directed against the other, and he who rejects the one is bound in consistency to reject the other. There is as little interference with human liberty in receiving the work of the Spirit to regenerate, as in receiv ing the work of the Son to redeem and justify.</p>
      
      <p> The loss of the Spirit and the restoration of the Spirit— the former the result of the fall, and the latter the result of the atonement—have thus passed before us in review. They are the two most momentous facts in the history of man. They are associated with the first man's sin and the second man's reparation. The fall left the human heart, once the temple of God, an utter ruin, because the Great Inhabitant who dwelt in it was under the necessity of leaving the polluted spot. With the Spirit's return to the human heart, on the ground of that everlasting righteousness which Christ ushered in, a new creation began to dawn, and a new kingdom entered which will be dissolved no more. It is of little use —except for the analogy—to recall what might have been had the first Adam fulfilled the conditions imposed on him by his Creator. The human race would have enjoyed without forfeiture the irrevocable aid and presence of the Holy Spirit beyond the hazards of falling. And the same constant presence of the Spirit, with all the efficacy of His omnipotent grace, which the redeemed will for ever enjoy, would have been transmitted to his descendants of the human family upon a tenure liable to no disastrous forfeiture.</p>
      <p> The Lord Jesus, the second man, having fulfilled all the conditions which devolved on Him as the Surety of those whom the Father had given Him, conveys to each of them a supply of the Holy Spirit irrevocably sure and indefectible. The ground of that supply is that the second Adam stood; and in consequence of His finished work, they who are effectually united to Him shall never finally forfeit the Spirit's communications. While many grounds and reasons may be mentioned why Christ's disciples never fall away, the principal ground, based at once on divine law and justice, is that the second Adam, by fulfilling the conditions, and com plying with all the requirements of the law, received as His reward an inexhaustible supply of the Spirit, which should be imparted to all His people, and dwell in them for ever. The</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   201</p>
      <p> Spirit, accordingly, never permits them finally to depart.     He will not abandon the souls which   He has regenerated, and which He will use effectual means to reclaim when they are ready,   from   inward    feebleness   or   listless   indifference,   to vacillate or waver.    He will not suffer them to depart for ever, but will renew the exercises of repentance and faith so that they will return to their allegiance (Isa. lix.  21), and continue to have the place of sons in the family of God.    The great work of the Spirit, with a view to adoption, is union to Christ, which in an objective point of view constitutes them the sons of God. According to semi-Pelagian theories, the first good begins with the man, and the Spirit of God is only a benevolent wellwisher, but no Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.     The real deed, and not the vague desire, begins on man's side, though he is described as "  dead in sin"     The grand evil of all these systems is, that they insert a legal condition which men have to perform, and all ends at last in the law of works, leaving men to apply to themselves as they best may the benefits which the Eedeemer purchased.    Humanity is thrown back, under a goodly guise, upon the principle— DO AND LIVE.     And whether it be the influence of hope or fear, whatever imposes on man an obligation to act from himself as the principle of action, is legal in its inmost germ, and enmity to God—how ever concealed under an ostentatious attachment to grace in a one-sided way.    In these systems the gift of salvation is  not given to the man,  but to his strenuous self-application.     But if the application in the last instance rests on man's inherent power, he inevitably relies on his reliance, or believes in his belief; and no exercise of ingenuity can extricate him from the vortex of legalism.    So much was Luther persuaded of the legalism of all this, that in his treatise on the Bondage of the Will, in answer to Erasmus, his whole reasoning assumes that it is a mockery to present the finished work of Christ to men  who  are  taught  that  they possess inherent power } as this undermines the whole.</p>
      
      <p> The full development of these systems appears in preaching A  DEAD FAITH.  And their naturalistic tendency expresses itself in the assertion that they do not know a wrong faith, and that there are  not two ways of believing.  On the contrary, the Bible speaks of a dead faith. The confessions of the Reformation,  drawn from Scripture, delineate faith as a new religious principle of life, awakened by the Holy Spirit with out man's active aid. It is an instructive fact that some of the old Lutheran divines, in their apprehension lest an element of works should be introduced into our title, objected at one time to the designation " living faith;" but it is said that not one now exists that does not solemnly abjure the error. And no reflecting mind can fail to see that faith must exist as an implanted habit, or grace of the Holy Spirit in apprehending the Saviour as our righteousness; and very evidently  it never docs or can exist without thus apprehending Clirist.  Hence in all the systems above delineated, in harmony with the dead faith which is propounded, there is uniformly a painful want of reference to the personal Redeemer. They allude to an object in the past in formal contrast with a present object; they preach a salvation in abstract separation from His Person, and as little connected with Him as if He had never risen. Calvin says: Such a separation of Christ from His Spirit makes Him like a dead image or corpse. 1</p>
      <p> That man owes his entire renovation to the effectual opera tion of the Holy Spirit, is evident enough from what has been already said. Any synergism or co-operation on man's side in the first instance would necessarily presuppose the ex istence of powers and faculties in order to that co-operation. But in the explicit statements of Scripture man is represented as impotent, nay, dead in trespasses and sins (Eph. ii. 1); thus rendering co-operative action toward his own resuscitation</p>
      <p> 1  On Rom. viii. 10, Calvin says :  "Christum a splritu suo qui divellunt, eum faciunt mortuo simulacra vel cadaueri similem."</p>
      
      <p> THE SPIRIT'S REGENERATING WORK ON THE INDIVIDUAL.   203</p>
      <p> impossible, and only an absurd idea. On the contrary, the Scripture emphatically describes the divine action of the Spirit as working in us to will and to do (Phil. ii. 13). But whether He  works in us to will,  or subsequently works  with tis  when we are enabled to will, the entire glory of regenera tion and of conversion belongs to the Spirit of God. There is no middle ground, no intermediate stage between death and life, between conversion and non-conversion; for the origin of spiritual life must be instantaneous. It is compared to creation (Ps. li. 10; Eph. ii. 10); it is compared to resurrec tion (Eph. i. 19). The man who is the subject of the change is the party on whom creative omnipotence acts, to the ex clusion of all mental preparations on man's side,—for he is only receptive,—and all merits of congruity of every description.</p>
      
      <p> LECTURE   V.</p>
      <p> ON TIIK SPIRIT OF HOLINESS.</p>
      <p> X our last lecture we discussed the Spirit's work on the individual, with special reference to the way and mode of His return to the human heart and to the application of redemption. By way of transition to the topic which will now occupy attention, let me recall the inseparable con nection between the work of Christ  FOR  us and the work of the Spirit  IN  us—a connection which it is of the utmost moment for sound theology as well as practical religion habitually to apprehend. It is a connection of cause and effect, or of merit and reward. It is in express terms set forth in such passages as the sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, where, in every variety of form, the apostle declares that the link between the justification of the man and the sanctiiication of his nature is of a kind as close and inseparable as that by which God connected Christ's atoning death and His resurrection to a premial life. The link between the two is secured not by the mere force of gratitude or by the influence of truth, but by something immeasurably more powerful, and which touches the deepest foundations of the divine government—viz. by the righteous restoration of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Rom. viii. 2). There cannot be the application of redemption in the way of pardon and acceptance without the accompanying Spirit of holiness.</p>
      <p> Here we must advert to  THE PART WHICH CHRIST ACTS IN GIVING THE SPIRIT.      In all Protestant theology, Lutheran and</p>
      <p> 204</p>
      <p></p>
      
      <p> Eeformed, there is a general consent that Christ is the acting life-communicating  head  by  His   Spirit.     It   is  not  Christ without   the   Spirit,   nor   the    Spirit   without    Christ.    His mediatorial  function was   not  limited   to   His   earthly   life. Nor  is  it   something outward, which every man is left   to appropriate to himself.    The whole application of redemption is not to be regarded merely as man dealing with God, but rather as the action of the God-man, in His  capacity as His people's representative   dealing   with   the   Father,  and   the Father dealing with the Son, according to  the  counsel  of peace between them both, with a view to man's acceptance. And the participation of saving blessings is through the power of the Spirit.    The exalted Saviour has this in view in the entire exercise of His priestly functions towards God, as well as of His kingly office towards men.    It is not man's will, which is weak and changeful, but the effectual will of the God-man, which is to  be regarded as the   turning-point or hinge.    And though He employs His Holy Spirit according to the economic order in the Godhead, it is by His direct act as Head that He attaches to Himself His members, and calls them  into   fellowship   or joint  participation with   Himself. They are apprehended by Christ Jesus (Phil. iii. 12).</p>
      <p> The  FAITH  by which the application of His merits is instrumentally conveyed is itself the gift of Christ, exalted as a Prince and Saviour, to give the blessings of His purchase, to incorporate the living members into vital union with Him self, and to work effectually in His people by the efficacy of His Spirit through the word and in the whole ministerial commission.</p>
      <p> We wish, for the sake of non-theological readers, to refer to this point—viz. the reproduction of Christ's spiritual life in His people. As Adam's life is reproduced in the entire human family with all its alienation from the life of God, and with the organic ruin of their whole nature, so the new life of the God-man flows over to all His people. The</p>
      
      <p> natural birth connects us with the first man, and renews his life. The new birth connects us with the second man, who, by the Holy Spirit, gathers His people under Him by a self-communicating act. I am the more desirous to give a due place to this great truth, because it lias been less developed within the last century than in the previous periods. The last Adam is a quickening Spirit (1 Cor. xv. 45). That life is in the Son, who, by the Spirit, apprehends the whole man in all his faculties ; and the renewing process will be com pleted even on his body at the resurrection - day. Every believer, though not directly conscious of connection with the first man, is, or ought to be, permanently conscious of his union to the second Adam, who is our life.</p>
      <p> The Spirit's work was specially intended to form a MYSTIC UNION  with Christ for the application of redemption, and for the  INHABITATION  of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Rom. viii. 2). I need not refer in detail to the several figures or similitudes under which that union is exhibited in Scripture as a potential reality (2 Cor. xi. 2 ; Eph. iv. 16 ; John xv. 1—6 ; Eph. ii. 20). These various figures taken from marriage, from the union of the human body with the Head, from the vine and branches, from the temple and the corner-stone, are intended to set forth a real and intimate connection, and to show that the inmost soul of the redeemed is reserved for Christ's inhabitation by the Spirit, who thus becomes the life of their life, the soul of their soul, in a sense to which any other known union makes no approximation. The Spirit is the bond of union on Christ's side, and faith, produced by the Spirit of faith, is the bond on our side; and when that union is effected, the soul, like the fruitful branch of the vine, brings forth abundant fruit.</p>
      <p> As to the union, in reference to which it is said by the apostle : " He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit" (1 Cor. vi. 17), the results that immediately flow from it are so extensive and so powerful, for the supply of the covenant</p>
      
      <p> blessings, that Christ's Spirit becomes theirs, His holiness their holiness, His joy their joy. Such is the Spirit's efficacy, that there is not one thought, feeling, or emotion pervading the human bosom of the man Christ Jesus amid the glories of the upper sanctuary, but may be said to be renewed and reproduced in the experience of His people, perfectly in the bliss above, incipiently in their present dwelling-place below. So real is the union through the Spirit, and so deep the sympathy reciprocally exercised between the ever-living Head in heaven and the spiritual body which He has united to Himself, that, on the one hand, every want, necessity, and sorrow under which His people groan vibrates to Him like the touching of a chord, of which He is instantly aware ; while, on the other hand, an injury offered to His cause awakens in them such a sense of oneness and of conscious identification with His interests and honour as constrains them to say : " Rivers of water run dow r n my eyes, because they keep not Thy law " (Ps. cxix. 136). By the Spirit our whole person is united to His whole Person. And the bond of union depends not, as Eomanists and Eitualists allege, on bodily contact or local nearness, but on faith, by means of which we are one with Him ; for Christ does not come down corporeally from heaven for the accomplishment of any of the objects con templated by that union in this our earthly pilgrimage.</p>
      <p> Whether the elect of God were already united to Christ before the actual exercise of faith, was a point keenly debated in England two centuries ago between the followers of Crisp, who affirmed it, and their opponents, led by Dr. D. Williams, who denied it. As the exaggerated terms in which the former spoke of eternal justification caused suspicion and alarm, Witsius, the celebrated Dutch divine, prepared his admirable  irenicum  to bring the parties together. 1  The solution which he gave of the controverted point was con-</p>
      <p> 1   Vid.  Witsius,  Animadversiones Irenicce ad Controversial quasdam Anrjli-canaK,  Leyden 1700.</p>
      
      <p> tained in the distinction that the saints were in Christ by a federal and legal union before the foundation of the world, but that the actual union—called the mystical or vital union —takes place only  WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT UNITES THEM  to the Son of God. From that moment, they who are united to the Lord Jesus by one Spirit obtain a true and actual parti cipation in all that He procured by His obedience unto death. If Christ satisfied divine justice, they who are united to Him by faith have also satisfied it. When Christ overcame, they overcame; when Christ received perfect acceptance as the Surety, they received the same acceptance in and with Him. And, on the other hand, as Christ obtained a resurrection-life, a life of holiness and joy at God's right hand for ever, they, too, who are found in Him, have an incipient life of the same nature, a life hid with Christ in God (Col. iii. 3).</p>
      <p> This brings us to the great truth, frequently affirmed and repeated in Scripture— THE INHABITATION OF THE SPIRIT  in all true believers. The passages are very numerous which teach this great doctrine. Thus Christ, in promising the Comforter, who should abide with His disciples for ever, added, by way of contrasting the world and them : " I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may  abide with you  for ever—the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him ;  for He dwellctJi with you and shall be in you "  (John xiv. 16). The Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, says : " That good thing which was committed to thee keep  by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us"  (2 Tim. i. 14). I shall notice, further, the passages where the Christian is called the temple of the Holy Ghost: " Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that  Ike Spirit of God dwelleth in you"  (1 Cor. iii. 16). " Know ye not that your body is  the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God" (1 Cor. vi. 19). We may compare other similar passages (2 Cor. vi. 16 ; Eph. ii. 22). In all</p>
      
      <p> these passages the Holy Spirit who dwells in Christ, and who is given to inhabit His people, is said to occupy the Christian's heart as His temple, not by a mere inactive pre sence, but as animating and pervading all the faculties and powers of the human mind.</p>
      <p> The regenerate man, accordingly, is said to  HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST.  The expression is used by the apostle in the Epistle to the Komans in two connected clauses in such a way as implies an inhabitation on the part of the Holy Spirit, and a consequent possession on our side as a graciously imparted privilege: " But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God  dwell in you.  Now, if any man  HAVE NOT THE SPIRIT  of Christ, he is none of His " (Rom. viii. 9). To  HAVE THE SPIRIT,  then, is inseparably connected with the inhabitation of the Spirit. We are thus said to " have " the Spirit as the consequence of His effectual inhabitation, and by a renewing and transforming principle of life, which constantly operates in the most active manner. And we are conscious of having so great a guest, because He condescends to occupy the soul in all its faculties.</p>
      <p> It may be proper at this stage to obviate a common misinter pretation, which tends to evacuate the phrases in the passages to which we have referred of their full significance. From a speculative reluctance to accept the idea of the Spirit's per sonal inhabitation, sometimes in one interest and at other times in another, many interpreters, scholastic as well as Protestant, expounded the allusions to the indwelling of the Spirit as referring only to the gifts which He confers.</p>
      <p> That is an arbitrary exposition on the part of the inter preter for which no good ground can be assigned. When the allusion is to gifts conferred,—except in the case of temporary disciples like Judas,—we must rather say that the personal Holy Spirit was given along with the gifts which were bestowed. He did not produce them as an absent regulator of their distribution, but as a present inhabitant. Nay, we may</p>
      <p> 0</p>
      
      <p> affirm that a person works only where he is; and it was only as inhabiting the hearts of believers that He imparted either the sanctifying gifts or the ministerial gifts.</p>
      <p> As this inhabitation is associated with the active exercise of divine power, it may be further noticed that it underlies all the Christian's holiness and growth, all his conformity to the divine image and final perseverance. It is the peculiar feature of every system that takes this truth in earnest, to bring out the essential difference between grace and nature, to vindicate the spiritual life as a new creation, to assert its actual reality, its peculiar organs, its habitual graces implanted,—with the several actings, experiences, wants, and appetences which belong to it as a distinct existence, but never separated from the living Head. To the neglect of this inhabitation of the Spirit must be ascribed much of the naturalism of the modern theology, which ascribes the graces of the Spirit only to the ordinary exercises of the mind as it unfolds itself in joy or sorrow, in faith or love, on a spiritual object; and they lose sight of the fact that the indwelling Spirit, filling and animating the renewed mental faculties, calls these graces into action over the ruins of the opposite corruption. On the contrary, the schools of theology which do justice to the great fact of the Spirit's inhabitation, such as the true followers of Augustin and the Puritans, were happily exempt from that humanistic theology. They contended not only for Christ's abid ing presence in every spiritual act (John xv. 5), but for the real implantation of the graces of the Spirit as well as for the impos sibility of putting them in motion without His heavenly help.</p>
      <p> The most eminent Lutheran divines, in the brightest period of their theology,—Luther, Chemnitzius, and the like, —were wont to teach that the inhabitation of the Spirit consisted in two things:  IN THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE AND OPERATION,  or, in a single phrase, in gracious presence. They were accustomed also to distinguish the modes of the divine presence in this fourfold way:  first,  a universal presence over</p>
      
      <p> all the wide realms of creation for the conservation of all things;  secondly,  a special sanctifying presence, whereby the Spirit abides in true Christians, and inhabits them continually through life and in death, till they fully enjoy the beatific vision;  thirdly,  the personal union of the Son of God, whereby He assumed humanity with all that the assumption carried with it, and replenished that humanity with His indwelling presence;  fourthly,  the presence of the Spirit in glorified saints, whereby He not only fills the heart with all the communications of His grace, but leads them to behold God's face in righteousness, and to be satisfied when they awake with His likeness.</p>
      <p> The Spirit's work, as the great inhabitant of the regenerate heart, appears in continually sanctifying all the mental powers; and a marked line of distinction must be drawn between  THE PREVENIENT GRACE OF THE SPIRIT  and His CO-OPERATING GRACE.  The former belongs to effectual calling, regeneration, conversion, and faith, in which the man with all his powers is the object in whom the Spirit operates by the word; the latter belongs to His progressive sanctification, in which the Spirit calls into exercise the new powers of the renewed mind, and where there are no immediate actings of the Spirit superseding that co-operation: for who can see without an eye, or hear without an ear ? The Holy Spirit does not move the hearts of regenerate men by mere power, but on another principle. He moves them by  THOSE SPIRITUAL POWERS  or graces with which they are now provided. The Spirit which is in Christ without measure, is in them by measure as a Spirit of life, not moving the mind as a stone, or as a wheel, by mere power, but according to the new nature which has been created and formed in it. To lose sight of this is to ignore the fact that Christ is the source of the Spirit of life, and that the Christian has to add to his faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and all the various excellences which are perfect in Christ Jesus (2 Pet. i. 5). Hence, they who are renewed</p>
      
      <p> after their Lord's image have, according to their measure, a certain spiritual power, a certain law of their mind, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which enables them to overcome and triumph in their Lord (Rom. viii. 2).</p>
      <p> The practical neglect of this distinction may sometimes be traced in Church history and on whole generations of men. The Lutherans, for example, though they spoke much and admirably of grace and liberty, were too easily satisfied that the good tree, by the inevitable law of its existence, would bring forth its fruit. They neglected the due cultivation of the graces of the Spirit in the new creature. On the contrary, the Puritans primed and cultivated the good tree with unwearied diligence, and made every Christian grace, after scriptural example, the subject of wholesome exhortation.</p>
      <p> I have been led, by various considerations, to attempt a very brief discussion, in connection with the inhabitation of the Spirit, of the whole subject of  CHRISTIAN ETHICS.  It is never safe to leave this department a blank in theological study, or to hand it over, as is commonly done, to the cold region of moral philosophy, as if it were unworthy of special cultivation. The Church is never safe without an indepen dent study of Christian ethics based on union to Christ, and deduced from the renewing grace and inhabitation of the Spirit. The position I lay down is, that Christian ethics, while occupying a well-understood relation to philosophic morals, are vitally connected with the inhabitation and renova tion of the Holy Spirit, and that they have their own peculiar principle, and produce their own independent results.</p>
      <p> I said Christian ethics have a well-understood relation to philosophic morals. When it is asked, What is that relation ? we answer, one point may be safely postulated. They cannot contradict each other in their ultimate decisions. If they could be supposed to contradict each other, this would involve the startling result that there are two moralities, one of nature, and another from the Spirit of life; in other words,</p>
      
      <p> that natural religion in its ethical rules held that to be duty which revealed religion condemned as sinful or unwarrantable. Such a collision cannot be. It is true they start from totally different principles, and move in totally different spheres. But in their ultimate results they can involve no mutual contradiction.</p>
      <p> But it may be asked, Is not one of them superfluous ? May we not take from some of the systems the whole frame work and nomenclature, and content ourselves with the simple task of replenishing these with a new spirit or higher life ? Letting the mould remain, may we not pour into it a new life ? In some such way those must have argued who adopted with satisfaction the maxim that philosophy is the handmaid of theology, forgetting that this is the certain way for her becoming mistress. We may take an illustration from Aquinas. Aware that there is a point of contact between the Christian ethics and the systems of antiquity, and unwilling to regard as fruitless the imposing outline which Aristotle bequeathed, he would superinduce the Christian on the classical, or put the new wine into the old bottles. He would take the four cardinal virtues as comprehending all that is purely human, and only supplement them by the so-called theological virtues, faith, hope, and love, along with the seven graces of the Spirit. Had he put the two systems —the philosophical and the Christian—in juxtaposition as shadow and reality, as law and grace, as nature's deep sigh after an unrealized ideal, and the realization which the Holy Spirit confers, it might have been an interesting as well as useful outline. But, as it was, the result was to the injury of both. Similar illustrations may be drawn from any period of the Protestant Church, where we find Christian ethics poured into the mould supplied by the systems of benevolence or of the moral sense.</p>
      <p> Are they never to run into one, even in the last problem awaiting the earth, when reason and revelation shall sweetly</p>
      
      <p> coalesce ? I answer, philosophic morals belong to us as reasonable beings: Christian ethics belong to us as redeemed men. Melanchthon, who may be named along with Butler as one of the greatest ethical writers of the Protestant Church, happily said : " Moral philosophy is that part of the divine law which treats of external actions." If we accept this definition, which may be frankly done, philosophic morals differ from Christian ethics as law from grace, demand from obedience, shadow from substance. We cannot speak of two moralities. Christianity is not, according to the Unitarian interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, a new and stricter law. It has not come to usher in a different ethics, but to make the preceptive " thoti shalt" an attained reality by renewing man's nature, and shedding on him a transforming power, which shall ennoble and elevate all his faculties and all his relations.</p>
      <p> Christian ethics have their own peculiar source, and produce their own independent results. The entire subject must be placed in immediate connection with the Spirit of Christ. It is this connection with the Spirit which ensures to Christian morals their proper independence, and their cul tivation as a department of theology. When we reach this point of view, it is no more with abstract ethical laws that we have to deal, nor a mere ideal that we have to contemplate. A realized ideal of ethics stands before us in the human life of Christ—into which we are engrafted by the Holy Spirit in the nearest conceivable way.</p>
      <p> From this view of Christian ethics we can look down on the faulty and ineffectual systems that have been presented to the minds of men. It has been customary, in some quarters, to consider Christian ethics as produced by the mere force of motives operating on those who are the subjects of redemp tion. Nor is that influence to be repudiated ; for it is a half truth. It has been common amonc: others to restrict the</p>
      <p> o</p>
      <p> matter to a catalogue of rules, or to a doctrine of duties.    Nor</p>
      
      <p> is that to be forgotten or despised. But Christian ethics occupy a much more close connection with the Spirit as uniting us to Christ. We come to a point, whenever we touch the resurrection-life, where precept and fulfilment may be viewed as one. If the subject presupposed in all the exercises and precepts comprehended in Christian ethics is the risen Christian,—if nothing is enjoined but what may be developed from his spiritual life, and it is thus that the apostolic Epistles always put the matter,—then it is not mere self-acting motives, not a mere doctrine of duties, but some thing more intimately connected with the divine Eedeemer, that is the principle of Christian ethics. That principle is the risen life through the Spirit of life.</p>
      <p> To place the relation of Christian ethics to the personal Christ in its true light, I shall notice the modifications which the entire subject undergoes, according to the conception which men entertain of Christ's Person. A brief survey of this point will show in what close connection they stand to His Person. Greatly should we err were we to suppose that any view of Christ's Person would equally avail for the production of Christian ethics. It is the more important to notice this point, because it has often been said that it is well-nigh indifferent for this department whether the mind is attached to evangelical sentiments or the reverse. A cursory glance will immediately show the modifications of the whole subject according to the opinions entertained of Christ's Person.</p>
      <p> On the  UNITARIAN VIEW  of Christ's Person, the inquirer comes at once to the conclusion that we have nothing in Christian ethics beyond what reason can give — a code of rules, a book of duties. It has been found that, among the Unitarians, there is an ethical system irrespective of Christ's Person, and that there is nothing to prevent men from hoping to surpass Him in the use of means and aids furnished by the course of centuries.</p>
      
      <p> On the  PELAGIAN THEORY,  which has no renewing work of the Holy Spirit, the effect on ethics is disastrous. Ethical laxity at once ensues. They who dispense with the Spirit's aid to restore man to a position higher than his present imperfection, and who include in their view of grace nothing more than exhortations and moral suasion to faculties neither hurt by the fall nor incapable of good, have no high theory above their practice. And when the distinction between theory and practice is merged, the consequence is a lax and defective system of ethics.</p>
      <p> On the  EOMISII THEORY,  which transmutes the gospel into a new law, the system of ethics never escapes from legal bondage, and is never ushered into liberty; for it discourages all assurance of salvation. So long as men are exhorted to merit salvation, pride—the inmost sin of the human heart— never can be destroyed. While attention is limited to single sins, to the neglect of the sinful nature, men have no humbling discovery of sin; and thus their whole ethical system oscillates between bondage and spiritual pride.</p>
      <p> The Biblical principle of justification by faith alone affects, to its utmost limits, the whole dominion of Christian ethics. One broad position characterizes scriptural Protestantism. Ethical action is not pursued to merit salvation, but because the man is saved by grace; or, to adopt the Biblical represen tation, it is the good tree that yields the good fruits; while the fruits cannot prevail to change the tree. The notion that ethical action goes before acceptance, and with a view to secure it, vitiates the entire character of the action. Christian ethics, on the contrary, are the fruits, results, and evidences of the salvation. In this all the Protestant Churches are at one, having the liberty of grace, and dependence on the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> I have adduced these illustrations from various systems to show that Christian ethics lean on the Person of Christ, and are an emanation from the law of the Spirit of life in Christ</p>
      
      <p> Jesus (Eom. viii. 2). They are the effect or issue of living in communion with Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit, or they are the mode of acting to which that communion gives rise. When the Christian dwells in communion, the practice of the virtues is in consequence of the Spirit's opera tions, not so much an arduous effort as the natural expression of his life. It is his nature, his life to practise them. All those single graces and virtues given with the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus (Eom. viii. 2) only wait to be called into action ; and that communion with Him who is the life lends the motive power in most cases without an effort. The passive and effortless facility with which the Christian practises many of the virtues is often strikingly exposed by Luther.</p>
