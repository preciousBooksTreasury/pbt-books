      <p> There is  A THREEFOLD STANDPOINT OF THEOLOGICAL CON CEPTION  which, during the present generation, has moved the German mind. One extremely negative tendency proceeded on the supposition that Christianity had outlived itself, and that what had been regarded as the life-principle of the Church in all ages, faith in the historical Person of Jesus,</p>
      <p> 1  Kahnis,  Die Lchre vom Heilicjen Geiste,  Halle 1847. Having procured the first part of this work thirty-five years ago, I eagerly waited for its continuation. The writer had before this published a Latin tractate denying the personality of the Spirit. Here he asserts the opposite view, and in an able, erudite way adduces the Patristic testimony down to Origen. Whether the author wearied of his subject, or Germany showed no interest in it, or whatever was the cause, the learned author never proceeded further with his undertaking. The only other recent works on the doctrine of the Spirit in the whole compass of German literature are the two following small treatises, of no great importance : (1) Wb'rmer,  Das Verhaltniss des Gewtes zum Solme Gottes,  Stuttgard 1862 ; and (2)  Die BedfMtung des Heilirjen Gelstes bezuylich der avferstehung des Leibes (anonymous), Basle 1866.</p>
      
      <p> incarnate, crucified, and risen, the Redeemer of sinful humanity and the source of life, must give way before another, a new and spiritualized, form which disengages the idea from the shell of the historical manifestation. Against this tendency all Christians in all lands maintained the same positive historical belief. But two other tendencies, while at one in opposing the above-named school of Baur and Strauss, diverged from each other in carrying out their special conception of Christianity. A  second  tendency, therefore, held firmly by the ecclesiastically given form in which Chris tianity had won its triumphs as a missionary power among the nations, and as a principle of reformation from the cor ruptions of Popery; and they were disposed to regard this as necessary for the future as it had been powerful in the past. A  third  tendency attempted to continue at one with  Rationalism in the principles of philologico-historical interpretation, and only desired a more spirited application of them. They would not break the thread of development where Rationalism began.</p>
      <p> This last tendency, known as the mediating school, which took its rise with  Schleiermacher  (A.D.  1820-34), did not recognise  THE PERSONALITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,  and con sequently had nothing to say as to His  WORK.  Schleier-macher's views were in most things antagonistic to the Church doctrines. It may be said of Schleiermacher's system, though we cannot in this place completely analyse it, that it struck to the core the mind of his country, casting many in its mould, and in others setting in motion an un wonted energy of action and reaction such as nothing but the mighty impulse of a mighty spirit could create. In his system all the great doctrines connected with God as an authoritative lawgiver fall into the background. But great and glowing prominence is given to all the views which stand connected with the Person of Jesus as a fountain of spiritual influence. The centre round which His whole theology moved</p>
      
      <p> was, to use his own expression, the communion of life with the Redeemer  (Lebens Gcmeinschaft mit dem Erloser}.</p>
      <p> But in reference to the distinction which obtains between the Persons of the Godhead, his views were Sabellian: Christ as the Logos, said he, apart from his manifestation in a par ticular Person (!), belongs to ecclesiastical conceptions; and instead of a personal Holy Ghost he speaks merely of " the common Spirit of the Christian Church proceeding from God." The Schleiermacher school, which has risen to great influence and is still rising, bore the distinct impress of Sabellianism or Modalism from its commencement. An ingenious essay 1 appeared from the pen of Schleiermacher expressly comparing the Athanasian and Sabellian doctrine, and assigning the marked superiority to the Sabellian theory. But, ingenious as the exposition undoubtedly was, it was highly unjust to Biblical Trinitarianism. The entire school, so far as it abides by Schleiermacher's principles, cannot be regarded as assert ing anything approaching to sound ecclesiastical Trinitari anism. In as far as it has accepted Schleiermacher's opinions on this point, and it has done so with a greater or less general consent, we find nothing but the indwelling scheme or the Sabellian view of Jesus. In every form of Sabellianism—of the modern not less than the ancient type—there has always been and must be a certain affinity to Pantheism. In Schleiermacher's essay, already referred to, it was strongly asserted that Christian faith did not expressly teach the Deity of Christ. It was alleged that Deity was attributed to Him only in hymns, poetical effusions, and rhetorical addresses; that the Church-doctrine of the Trinity arose in Alexandria through a Platonizing tendency and in a philo sophical interest; and that, but for this, the Sabellian doctrine, which accepts no personal distinction in the Godhead, would doubtless have become the predominant opinion. Not only</p>
      <p> 1  This essay originally appeared in the  Theoloyische Zeitschrlft von Schleier macher, De Wette, itnd Lilcke.     Drittes Heft.</p>
      
      <p> so, he goes on to affirm still further that  Sabdlianism satisfies the demands of Christian piety as well as the Church-doctrine ; and that it has this peculiar consideration to recommend it, that while the Church-doctrine is transcendent, the Sabellian view, on the contrary, refers to the order of salvation and to God's relation to the world. According to this Modalism, which has no tri-personal God, the name  SON OF GOD  means no more than God redeeming; and the name  SPIRIT OF GOD means no more than the union of God with the Christian Church without distinct personality.</p>
      <p> On the contrary, all sound Trinitarian divines have main tained that the very transcendence of the Church-doctrine which Schleiermacher depreciates is its true glory. They assert that all the Persons of the Trinity are what they are prior to creation, prior to redemption, prior to the formation of the Christian Church.  These deeds only manifested what the Persons were essentially from all eternity. They only revealed themselves by deeds of power and of grace. They were divine Persons with a distinct subsistence prior to and irrespective of any deeds performed in creation, in redemption, or in regeneration. But we limit ourselves here to the work of the Holy Ghost. It is evident from Scripture that men were regenerated by the Spirit, and raised up by Him to do a work for God, previous to the formation of the Christian Church; and that multitudes in all the ages subsequent to the fall, and prior to the day of Pentecost, were enlightened by Him with a true spiritual knowledge, and possessed with a true spirituality of mind. All this, as we read in the Old Testament records, was going on before the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit dwelt in prophets and righteous men in the Old Testament as well as in the supernaturally gifted office-bearers of the New Testament Church; and the Spirit could not have so dwelt in them unless He really subsisted as a divine Person, with a distinct personality in the Godhead. Nor was that all: the Holy</p>
      <p></p>
      
      <p> Spirit was the cause of all the vast variety of miracles in both economies, and the author of all Old Testament prophecy as well as of all New Testament Scripture; both of which are spoken of as the work of the same Spirit, with no difference as to their origin or authority (2 Pet. i. 21).</p>
      <p> If all this is so, in vain do these Sabellian writers allege that the Spirit is but the union of God with the Christian Church. According to Schleiermacher's outline of the Sabellian theory, moreover, it is maintained that  the Holy Spirit is hit the Spirit of the whole, the common Spirit of the Christian Church.  It is difficult to apprehend precisely what that means. But the explanation which he himself gives of the statement is in the last degree startling: " The Spirit," says he, " is only in the whole: for as the Spirit is just the God head,  every Christian must be a Christ,  IF THE SPIRIT AS SUCH WERE IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL."  The more that the reader attempts to apprehend the import of that statement, the more surprise and pain take possession of every reverent mind. But plainly, according to the meaning of the terms, the only difference between Christ and the Christian is to be traced to a more and a less of the inhabiting Godhead; and the state ment implies that the Spirit, so understood, is  RELATED TO THE CHURCH AS A WHOLE,  as the Deity in Christ is related to His humanity. The writer, with all his vast powers, plainly knew not what he said, nor whereof he affirmed.</p>
      <p> Such is modern Sabellianism as set forth by its greatest modern defender. It is fully discredited by the mere state ment of the Scripture testimony that the Spirit's activity preceded the existence of what is known as the Christian Church.</p>
      <p> To do justice to the school of Schleiermacher, among whose scholars there are many who have risen far above him in single points, it must be stated that it loyally adheres to historical Christianity, and maintains the foundation on which the Church has been supported from the beginning. They</p>
      
      <p> who belong to it, however, are (1) neither acquainted with the true distinction between the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit, nor able to put them in their proper place and due relation to each other. Of course they cannot do so, fur they have no doctrine of the Spirit, and cannot make a due distinction between the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit on a Sabellian basis which denies His personality. Xor is this strange. For if the belief of a personal Holy Spirit naturally leads men to an admission of His super natural works as something that belongs to Him in the diviue economy, and especially to receive the inspired Scriptures as the standing monument of His activity, we may affirm, on the contrary, that a Sabellian view of the Spirit naturally leads men to the denial of the supernatural in any form.</p>
      <p> (2) Another peculiarity of the Schleiermacher school is their watchword,  THE CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUSNESS, OR THE TESTIMONY OF  THE HOLY SPIRIT.  They use both expressions, when in point of fact they, for the most part, have no personal Holy Ghost. They build on a Sabellian foundation, and yet retain the theological nomenclature in a sense entirely different from that which was usually accepted by their predecessors. What testimony of the Spirit can there be, and what Christian consciousness in any right sense of the expression can there be, without the regeneration of the Holy Ghost renewing the heart and occupying it by a true inhabitation ? It can have no underlying reality, and amounts only to a figure of speech. Their whole style of thought on the Christian consciousness is a mere phrase, and a wholly unwarrantable use is made of it when it is made a test and judge of Scripture.</p>
      <p> A few remarks will prove this. There is no Christian consciousness without a sense of six. But the school in question maintains tenets on the subject of sin which wholly undermine God's moral government, the nature and sanctions of the divine law, as well as the holy anger of God. This was expressed by Schleiermacher in an explicit denial of the</p>
      
      <p> fall and of sin. Sin was made a law of being—a dogma that undermines all reference to God's justice, as well as all necessity for a propitiation. The Lord Jesus was, indeed, depicted in glowing terms as the source of life and light, of joy and strength, but not as the Eternal Son, and only as  a person inhabited by God in a wholly unique, way.  We will not deny that many pleasing views are given forth by Schleier-macher and his school on the spiritual union between Jesus and His people, and on the indwelling presence of Christ. In reference, however, to the sinner's objective relation towards God there is a total blank; and even they who have advanced the farthest beyond their master's limits have but dim, undecided, and vacillating views on all the truths connected with man's acceptance with the Judge of all the earth. Schleiermacher's watchword was:  religion is feeling.  And carrying out this dogma, he everywhere asserts that doctrine is only an imperfect attempt to embrace in our conceptions the true, the infinite, and the eternal; that it is one-sided, mutable, and liable to error; and that, while faith and religion are in all alike the same,  each one, after he has done his utmost to elaborate the truth in his own way, has merely his own individual representation of it.  Thus men, by wisdom, display the opposite of wisdom when they do not bow to the authority of the pure arid perfect word of God.</p>
      <p> Yet this so-called Christian consciousness is made the arbiter and judge of Scripture. If the Christian conscious ness were definitely understood to be the sentiment of regenerate men, inhabited by the personal Holy Spirit, it would be entitled to some measure of respect. It would have much in common with Edwards' treatise on the Religious Affections, or with the subjective spirituality of the Puritans. As it is, it is natural feeling in many cases, not spiritual feeling; a mere public sentiment, wide enough to take in the consciousness of any man who is not an atheist—a Strauss or Eenan. It does not presuppose regeneration by the Spirit.</p>
      
      <p> The Bible does not regulate this Christian consciousness, but conversely the latter is used as the judge and arbiter of the Bible.</p>
      <p> Nor (3) has this school any right conception of the Scrip tures as the production of the personal Holy Ghost speaking by human agents. This also follows from the denial of a personal Holy Ghost. For any amount of free-thinking on the sacred Scriptures they are prepared, if only faith on the personal Redeemer and vital intercourse with Him can by any means be retained. Schleiermacher declared his deep conviction that faith in the revelation of God in Christ is nowise dependent on belief in a peculiar inspiration among the Jewish people up to a certain point; and he affirmed that nothing essential is lost thereby; that Christ remains the same, and faith in Him remains the same. All the scholars of Schleiermacher occupy the same unworthy relation to the Holy Scriptures.</p>
      <p> The testimony of  THE DUTCH CHURCH  in behalf of the doctrine of the Spirit has, since the Synod of Dort, been always more clear and effective than that of Germany. ])uring the last hundred years they have not contributed anything of much importance on the doctrine of the Spirit; and they are beginning to lose their independence to such a degree that they are content to register the last results of German thought and criticism. A few words will suffice to describe what has been done on the doctrine of the Spirit. At the close of last century, when Germany was beginning to surrender the divine Personality of the Spirit as they had surrendered His Work, we find a protest from Holland. Pro fessor Clarisse prepared two interesting treatises, one in Latin and another in Dutch, in which he successfully asserted the Biblical doctrine of the Deity of the Holy Spirit (1795). After the formation of the Hague Society for the defence of the Christian religion, there appeared as answers to the prescribed subject essays of considerable merit on the Deity</p>
      <p></p>
      
      <p> of the Holy Spirit by Lotze, Corstius, and Beuzekamp. In 1838, Heyningen published a little treatise which he kept by him upwards of twenty years, after unsuccessfully offer ing it as one of the prize essays on the doctrine of the Bible respecting the work of the Holy Spirit. It is a useful work, but with a very flagrant defect. The defect is, that he abstains from pronouncing with the firm, decisive tone which is absolutely necessary on the point which draws the line between Augustinianism and Semi-Pelagianism. The reader peruses it and is at a loss  ivhcther the author means that it is we or God that decisively wills the conversion of the soul. No one can say whether, according to Heyningen, it is God in the first instance that works in us to will and to do. But the rest of the work is valuable. He maintains, from a Biblical evidence which cannot be shaken, that the operation of the Spirit is  distinct from the effect of the word,  though con current with God's providence and the preaching of the word. This is set forth in a clear and satisfactory light. When we come farther down we trace the growing influence of German thought on the Dutch Church, and by no means to its advantage. Two prize essays prepared for the Hague Society appeared in 1844, the one by Thoden Van Velzen, the other by Stemler the Lutheran pastor at Hoorn. They are far from satisfactory. They give no testimony on the Personality of the Holy Spirit, which they leave in such absolute uncertainty that these writers can only be described as ignoring the subject; and what they say about the Spirit's Work is as vague and unmeaning as about His divine personality. The whole two volumes are occupied with a metaphysico-theolo-gico-exegetical attempt to harmonize man's free agency with a certain influence which is not the regeneration of the Holy Ghost, .</p>
      <p> The Swiss and  FRENCH CHURCHES  of this century have produced very little on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Like the Church of Holland, which we have just noticed, these</p>
      
      <p> Churches are losing their independence, and coming unduly under the spell of German theology and criticism. There are two interesting works, however, which have appeared in French Switzerland on the doctrine of the Spirit, one by E. Guers, Bern, another by Tophel in the form of five discourses, both written with warmth, devotional feeling, and unction. One point is very forcibly insisted on by Guers, the danger of the Spirit without the word, and of the word without the Spirit.</p>
      <p> It is now time to bring this historical sketch to an end. And in doing so I have only to remark—what Church history sufficiently verifies—that without a full testimony to the divine personality and agency of the Holy Spirit, no blessing can be expected on the ministrations of any Church. He is honoured by being invoked in every prayer, and by being referred to in every sermon. Wherever religion comes in power, the presence of the Spirit as connecting the Church on earth with Christ in heaven occupies a large place in the Church's consciousness and adorations. The doctrine of the Spirit not less than the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ's merits, is the article of a standing or falling Church, and without the recognition of it no religious prosperity exists or can exist.</p>
      <p> This historical survey of past centuries, bringing succes sively under our notice epochs of Revival, such as the age of Augustine, the Reformation, and the great awakening of last century, naturally suggests a closing remark which may not be out of place. The Church of God is in her right attitude only when she is waiting for the fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit, who comes from Christ and leads to Christ. We see combined in all successful preachers of the gospel right views of the Spirit's operations, an undiverted gaze upon the cross, and a proclamation of the fact that the Spirit comes to glorify the Son in His Person and in His offices. Thus we hear one exclaiming: " Spirit of preaching, that is, Spirit of</p>
      
      <p> Christ, come down upon me." * They have always set forth that spiritual life flows from the historical Christ the Surety through the Holy Ghost, and that though the Spirit comes not of necessity, but of free condescending love, He comes as the Spirit of our risen Lord, the organ by which He acts, the executive by whom He rules, the Comforter sent in Christ's name (John xvi. 13). And for the present sore and ulcerated condition of the Church, with many marked defects and perilous tendencies, nothing but a new effusion of the Spirit will avail. Many of these tendencies would be at once obviated by the efficacious presence of the Spirit. Of many currents which might be enumerated, the following three may be named, which all too plainly argue a want of the Spirit's power, viz. irreverent criticism of Scripture, sensuous Ptitualism, and spasmodic efforts put forth to produce by human appliances what can only be effected by the Holy Spirit:—</p>
      <p> 1.   As to the bold criticism of Scripture, proceeding as it does on a denial of its inspiration by the Spirit, it has no significance and no attractions for a mind that has personally come under the supernatural and regenerating operations of the Spirit.    Such a mind accepts on sufficient evidence with out difficulty all the divine facts and prophecies—in other words, all the miracles of power and of knowledge with which Scripture is replete, but which the higher criticism, starting from a philosophy opposed to the supernatural, exerts itself to the utmost to explode.</p>
      <p> 2.   As to the wide-spread Eitualism, it springs from a desire to substitute something sensuous for that which constitutes the true charm  and  glory of all  religious   ordinances—the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.    It betrays an unrest, a want which the ritualist knows not how to relieve.    To a mind replenished with  the Holy Spirit, ritualistic elements have no interest or attraction.</p>
      <p> 3.  With regard to the spasmodic efforts to awaken by human</p>
      <p> 1  The missionary Macdonald.</p>
      
      <p> appliances a religious interest in the minds of others, we must distinguish two things that differ. There is, on the one hand, a noble revival spirit, burning with a pure and steady flame, which is kindled and kept alive in proportion as the Holy Spirit inhabits and quickens the Christian heart to sustained and strenuous efforts for the salvation of others. It springs from the Spirit of grace: it leads to dependence on the Spirit's supernatural operations ; and they who cherish it never forget that success is not by might nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord (Zech. iv. 6). But, on the other hand, there is effort of a different sort—spasmodic and fitful, from self and for self, arguing impatience at the slow progress of the king dom of God, and prompting measures of the earth earthy. Impure and of a mixed character, it burns itself out; and is succeeded by despondency, exhaustion, and dissatisfaction. Wholly different are those efforts which are kindled by the Spirit and done in the strength of the Spirit. The effects are blessed and abiding to the glory of the Spirit's power and "race.</p>

      <p> The  FOREIGN THEOLOGICAL LIBRARY  was commenced in 1846, and from that time to this Four Volumes yearly (or about 160 in all) have appeared with the utmost regularity.</p>
      <p> The Publishers decided to begin a  NEW SERIES  with 1880, and so give an opportunity to many to subscribe who are possibly deterred by the extent of the former Series.</p>
      <p> The Publishers are sanguine enough to believe that a Series containing the works of writers so eminent, upon the most important subjects, cannot fail to secure support.</p>
      <p> The Binding of the Series is modernized, so as to distinguish it from the former Series.</p>
      <p> The Subscription Price will remain as formerly, 2is. annually for Four Volumes, payable in advance.</p>
      <p> A  SELECTION OF TWENTY VOLUMES</p>
      <p> FOR   FIVE   GUINEAS</p>
      <p> (OK MOKE AT SAME RATIO)</p>
