      <p> But this does not supersede exhortation iii any case. The possibility of practising the Christian graces, while presup posed and assumed in the whole domain of the Christian life as a life in the Spirit, does not preclude earnest admoni tion (Gal. v. 25). It is taken for granted that they are possible, nay, easy, and that the living Christian, risen with his Lord, is in a position to exhibit them; and Scripture, accordingly, when inculcating the practice of the graces, only touches some secret spring that has power to evoke them. Whether we look at the Sermon on the Mount, where various graces are enforced, from the deepest relations of the kingdom of God, of which Christ is the centre;—or at the grace of humility, enforced by the consideration that He who was in the form of God humbled Himself (Phil. ii. 3-7); or at the grace of liberality, commended by the motive that He who was rich became poor,—we find the same peculiarity. Christian ethics are never isolated from Christ and the deep relations of His kingdom.</p>
      <p> There are only two other points, in speaking of Christian ethics, called into action by the Holy Spirit, viz.: that every thing is viewed in relation to God, and that love is made the principle of ethical unity.</p>
      
      <p> 1.   The grand peculiarity of Christian ethics is, that in the entire range of this department nothing is to be isolated from God.    As we know Him who is Light, and Love, and Spirit,</p>
      <p> —as all is  from God  in the power of the Spirit, and  to God under the influence of the same Spirit, nothing is to be done but in connection with the divine. In the Person of Jesus we see the divine replenishing the human. And His followers, in like manner, in proportion as they drink into the same Spirit with Him, ennoble and glorify the scenes of earthly life by the divine Spirit derived from Him. "While the sphere of Christian ethics is so closely connected with the divine,—that is, from God and to God,—it must be added that every earthly relationship, and every scene in these relationships, must be made a vessel to contain and diffuse the heavenly treasure. Hence the lives of the early Christians shone with an un earthly beauty which attracted all eyes. The moral glory of their life, their purity and happy love, their self-denial and benevolence, reflected from the surrounding vice and moral lassitude of heathenism, shone like a vision from another sphere. By the renewing Spirit the divine was brought within the circle of the human.</p>
      <p> 2.   In the Christian ethics  LOVE  is the principle of unity. The philosophic morals, however much they might struggle toward general  principles, could  not advance to the ethical unity of love ; and no system, uninfluenced by  Christianity, ever dreamt of it.     This draws the line between Christianity and all other ethics in ancient or modern times.    That the unity of ethical life is love, may be proved from the nature of love, which unites the mind to the object, which is the very result to which all the operations of the Spirit conspire.    The Lord   and   His apostles teach  that  the various virtues and graces of the Spirit are not so much separate qualities, but diversified forms, modifications, and applications of the same thing which the  Spirit produces as the principle of ethical unity.      Paul,   in    his   exhaustive   delineation   of   the   one</p>
      
      <p> diffusive principle of love, describes the fundamental Christian virtues as all reducible to love (1 Cor. xiii.). He who has love, accordingly, has all the virtues. The cardinal virtues, the distribution of which was well and happily given in the ethics of antiquity, — wisdom, temperance, fortitude, and justice, — are only love as directive, as self-controlling, as militant, as attentive to the rights of others; and as love gradually advances, one of these may be at one time in greater prominence and another at .another. But they are only diversified forms of ethical unity—of love.</p>
      <p> We have now to notice the growing sanctification produced by the Spirit, or the increasing conformity to the divine image. That which enables Christianity to achieve what human speculation fails to accomplish, is the fact that it is a life derived from the Spirit of life,—not an idea, truth, or opinion,—and that as such it cannot but grow. In all systems that are of the earth, we have mere ideas which are as jejune and impotent as their propounders; whereas the last Adam is  A QUICKENING SPIEIT.  Whenever Christ is con sidered as a present fountain of life, and Christianity as open ing the way for the Spirit of life, it is essentially distinct from the mere influence of philosophical speculation. For where a new element of life is introduced into fallen humanity, and nature is not left to be wrought upon by a mere idea or a system of thought, but animated from within by the Spirit of Him who says: " I am the life," humanity is in connection with the great archetype to whose image we are predestinated to be conformed. This life is in the Son, who apprehends the whole man in all His faculties; all His people are included in Him as one man; and though their individual personality is not destroyed, they are included in the second Adam as they were in the first. In the figure of the vine, employed to explain this mystery, we are taught that as the vine diffuses life through numberless branches distinct from one another but not separate from the stem, so none of His</p>
      
      <p> people can for a moment be independent or isolated from the Spirit of life. On the contrary, they are conscious of a union to Him who is our life, and who awakens every spiritual desire in His people to such a degree that He says : " Without me ye can do nothing."</p>
      <p> Xor does the Spirit's subjective operations in any measure destroy man's freedom, though many theological systems urge the plea of freedom to exclude the Spirit of God from the heart, lint if the taint of the fall has not destroyed the essence of the soul, though infecting all its powers, it is capable of separation without prejudice to its freedom. No more does this put man's freedom in jeopardy, than the cures which Christ of old performed on men's bodies—the analogy being precisely similar. But those objections which are based on the plea of freedom proceed on an entire oblivion of the disturbing element of the fall. There is, in reality, no inter ference with man's freedom when the renewing and sanctify ing work of the Spirit commences and advances, though it involves all that is implied in a birth to which the man him self does not at all contribute,—in a new creation which argues almighty power,—and in a rising from the dead, which involves an energy wholly from without. The sub jective operations of the Spirit no more interfere with man's freedom than the objective work of the Son.</p>
      <p> Two misleading influences run counter to the active pro secution of progressive sanctification in the Spirit. Some regard sanctification as occupying the subordinate place of furnishing but an evidence of our salvation. They consider that Scripture, in enforcing sanctification of the Spirit, means little more than to supply an evidence that we are justified by faith. It is thus made a mere means to an end, whereas it is everywhere inculcated in Scripture as the express com mand of God (1 Pet. i.  1C;  1 Thess. iv. 3). Another tendency, in a different quarter, is to regard sanctification in the Spirit as something necessarily developed of its own</p>
      
      <p> accord, without   any   exercise   of  the   will.     But  Scripture allows no quarter for Quietism in any of its forms.</p>
      <p> While the actual possession of the Spirit of life is always presupposed, and the Christian in the pursuit of sanctification is always reminded to reckon himself as dead indeed to sin, and alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord (Eom. vi. 11),—in other words, as distinctly appreciating the specially meritorious ground of acceptance with the Moral Governor as well as the Person of the risen Christ, the source of all spiritual life and influence, — the Scriptures do not refrain from adducing motives. They touch many motives. Thus they adduce all the motives drawn from the threefold department of liberty, love, and spirituality (Gal. v. 13-26), from the fear of God (Phil. ii. 12), and from reward (Matt. x. 42).</p>
      <p> The obvious distinction between philosophic morals and Christian sanctification is, that the former commonly endeavour to produce their results by a single dominating principle, whereas the latter wields many various motives. We have only to recall any of the systems of antiquity or of modern times to perceive this marked distinction. The enumeration of the distinctive principle which the several systems avowed will suffice to show this. The principle of Plato—conformity to the divine image by idea—was a sort of unconscious antici pation of what was to come, but which there were no powers to effect in the classical world, apart from that life in the Spirit which was to revolutionize the human heart from within over all its bounds. That system, which may be called nature's dumb unuttered sigh for something higher, which the grace of the Holy Spirit alone could usher in, found in Christianity a realization—a spiritual and ethical conformity to the divine image in all the relations of earthly life—which was never dreamed of by its first propounder. The principle of another philosophic system, that of happiness as the chief good, mental repose, was a sort of sigh for that peace of mind and positive enjoyment of God which Christi-</p>
      
      <p> auity alone affords. The principle of another system, that of a life agreeable to nature, or the Stoical principle, which assumed that man continued in a nature pure and undis turbed, found its realization in Him who showed the full harmony of man with His nature, and who renews us after His image. The principle of another system, the royal mean between two extremes, which Aristotle applied to civil virtue in the relations of state-life, are realized in Christian ethics when we rise to the higher relations of the kingdom of God. The modern systems in like manner, whether we call up to view those which are known as the systems of benevolence or of the moral sense, correctly enough make the moral problem, or the chief end of man, the starting-point of their philo sophy, and propose a single principle as a lever to move this human life. But they only evince a partiality in favour of a single element or influence, if it could be set in motion. And when it is asked in certain places, What can Christianity do more ?—the answer is, it is the realization of all that these systems, as the deep sigh of nature, longed to realize, but failed to call into play. Christianity was the counterpart of that which nature sighed for, but could not produce. The truth anticipated in a mere vague expectation here found its truth, completeness, and reality. But what the gospel furnishes is not  ONE  principle, but many. The new life of the Spirit, indeed, is one, and a principle unknown to philosophic morals. But the motives which are touched and evoked are manifold and numerous.</p>
      <p> Closely connected with this line of thought, the whole subject of the Redeemer's character, as the perfect exhibition of a divine ideal, comes under our consideration. And we are changed into the same image as by the Spirit of the Lord when we behold it (2 Cor. iii. 18). The character of Christ as the loftiest ideal, the realized standard of human excellence, and the only exhibition of that image of God in which man \vas made, and to which he is predestinated to be conformed,</p>
      
      <p> is meant to be in the constant view of the Church as sketched by the pen of inspiration. All that can be done is to touch those springs which recall the reality, and which is to be surveyed and pondered with the earnest prayer that the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus may open the eyes of our understanding (Eph. i. 17). Owen, in his great work on the Person of Christ, well remarks : " Some men speak much of the imitation of Christ, and following of His example; and it were well if we could see more of it really in effect. But no man shall ever become like unto Him by bare imitation of His actions, without that view or intuition of His glory, which alone is accompanied with a transforming power to change them into the same image."</p>
      <p> . The character of Christ, thus seen through the word and by the illumination of the Spirit, impresses every mind that gazes on it with a sense of full-orbed completeness and per fection. But it is of a kind so new and unprecedented, that minds devoid of the Spirit are insensible to the glory of it. Let me here bring out more particularly one or two of the distinguishing features of Christ's moral perfection.</p>
      <p> The foundation of all lay in His humility. He laboured not to* rise aloft; He was the meek and lowly One. His public was not what men thought, or mere public opinion, but the eye of an omnipresent Father, before whom all human distinctions are of no account. This humility, which has been made the true foundation of all Christian ethics, found vent in the Lord's history in a renunciation of His own will, in a retreat from worldly honour, and in the words: " I am among you as one that serveth." As President Edwards has well re marked : " Christ, though He was the most excellent and honourable, yet was the most humble; yea, He was the most humble of all creatures."</p>
      <p> Christ's moral eminence was there before any of His works were done. The latter only revealed Him and discovered</p>
      
      <p> what He was. But these manifestations of spiritual excel lence bring before us One who, in the possession of the full supply of the Spirit, shows a full completeness and perfect equipoise of all the graces. Unlike every other human life, where the excellences and defects are nearly balanced, all graces were found, and all perfect. One grace did not dis place another, nor overshadow another. There was such a harmony of all the gifts and graces of the Spirit, that the exercise of one did not limit or interfere with the full energy of all the rest. He discharged the various duties of the family, and evinced to the last hour the most tender love and filial regard.</p>
      <p> And the simple principle which regulated that whole mar vellous life was obedience to His Father's will: " My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work" (John iv. 34). It was an unvarying obedience at every moment to the living Lawgiver pervading all the steps of life; and without an unconditional subjection to His Father's will, He never spent a moment. His whole obedi ence was founded in faith and love.</p>
      <p> The superiority of a living example to mere precept is proverbial. And duly to affect the minds of men, the moral code required to be embodied in a life which should engage all eyes and win all hearts. What was said by Plato, that if perfect virtue appeared among men, as a stranger from another sphere, all men would fall down and worship her, was not realized in the sense in which he expressed the anticipation,—for perfect virtue did appear, only to be despised and rejected,—but it is verified in the case of all whose minds have, by the regenerating grace of the Spirit, become suscep tible of impressions from that high and ennobling standard. The human life of the God-man stands before us as a pure emanation of humility, obedience, and love ; as an imperishable treasure, and an ideal to be reproduced in us. And, unlike all merely human histories, that example has the peculiarity</p>
      
      <p> attaching to it, that in proportion as it is beheld and contem plated in the light of the Holy Spirit opening the eyes of our understanding, it exercises a sanctifying power beyond all other influences. It forms in us through faith the very image of God, which we behold in Him (2 Cor. iv. 6). This is a creative example, infinitely meritorious as a procuring cause, and divinely efficacious in producing transforming results on the believing and adoring mind. It is an ideal which repro duces itself in the experience of the enlightened saint. His example becomes, in the Spirit's hand, when duly used, a plastic power, whereby we are changed into the same image. It is not a cold, distant example to which we stand in no living relation, and frowning upon us from an unapproachable elevation: it is the achievement of a forerunner whom we follow, the attainment of the first-born among many brethren to whom we are predestinated to be conformed. It embraces all life ; it is an example in solitude and society, in joy and sorrow, in poverty and the loss of friends, in suffering and death. And there it is to shine on our path, to elevate and transform us to what He was.</p>
      <p> The spiritual perception of divine things is invariably accompanied with a sanctifying influence; and knowledge is no further genuine or spiritual than as it leads to this result. When it is a mere natural and intellectual perception of divine things, the mind is only elated (1 Cor. viii. 2), not imbued with the humility which is the effect of all true spiritual knowledge. When it is a perception which takes its rise from the Holy Spirit, and is kindled by the contempla tion of the divine perfections, excellence, and glory, the taste is so changed that it is separated from the pleasures of sin. They who have a spiritual perception of the divine beauty are drawn by a high attraction, and easily induced to forego, not only the sins, but the pleasures, emoluments, and distinctions which absorb men's present thoughts. The knowledge of God, taught by the Spirit, is invariably connected with a new</p>
      <p> p</p>
      
      <p> spiritual relish, or a new sense, which inclines the mind to rest in God as better than the creature, to regard sin as repulsive, and holiness as the element in which the mind delights to dwell. The heart is weaned by the revelation of the surpassing excellence of God, and so drawn by the cords of a man, by bands of love, that the supreme God is not only accepted as its portion, but enthroned as its Lord, to whom every power must be subjected, and who is nearer and dearer than self.</p>
      <p> Thus far we have followed the operations of the Spirit of Holiness, and traced His work of sanctification, which is, on the one hand, a blessing unconditionally promised in the covenant of grace (Ezek. xxxvi. 27), and, on the other hand, a commanded duty according to the will of God (1 Thess. iv. 3). When we inquire what attainment is possible, or what pro gress is actually made, it appears at once how far men are, for the most part, from attaining the highest degree of sancti fication. Except in the cases where young disciples, in the warmth of first love, are prone to exaggerate their own measure of attainment, and the powers with which they think themselves invested, or to misconceive the strength and ramifications of the sin which lurks within them, Christians are commonly ready to acknowledge how far they are from having apprehended the great end or object for which they have been apprehended by Christ Jesus. Legal perfection there is not, and none will claim it. The evangelical attain ment which the Scriptures hold up before the mind, arid sometimes term perfection, consists only in the fact that they •who have the perfect righteousness of Christ imputed to them are so largely occupied by Christ's Spirit, and so powerfully wrought upon by the Spirit's grace, that they have the first beginnings of a perfect obedience which will reach its full measure and degree in the celestial state. At present, it is more in aim and purpose and unfeigned sincerity than in performance. Even Paul had not attained, however much he</p>
      
      <p> forgot the things which were behind, and reached forth to those things which were before (Phil. iii. 13).</p>
      <p> A peculiar phase of Christian experience has, in recent times, been presented to men's attention by those who are commonly known as the advocates of the higher life, or of the life of faith. They are in principle and sentiment very much allied to the mysticism of Madame Guion and the mediaeval mystics. Professor Upham, of America, is the representative of the class. They have given it to be understood, as their sort of watchword, that the Christian can in this life do the will of God without inward opposition, without the inner conflict, or at least without the consciousness of it. They, moreover, connect the entering into rest with certain subjec tive frames or phases of inward experience, instead of repre senting rest as connected with the acceptance of the Person, offices, and work of the one Mediator between God and man.</p>
      <p> As much loose thinking and unsound doctrine are always disseminated when the Spirit's work within is made to eclipse or overshadow the Redeemer's finished work without, it may be useful to notice the points at which such a theory diverges from sound doctrine. These are two: (1) defective views of Christ's imputed righteousness; and (2) a misapprehension of a Christian's double being. Instead of extolling the surety-righteousness of the Lord Jesus, all Perfectionists speak only of what is infused. They call in an exaggerated, overweening estimate of their own sanctification, and depreciate the law-magnifying obedience of Christ as the Lord our righteousness. As to the double being of a Christian, consisting, as he does, during this mortal life, of flesh and spirit, they do not make the necessary distinction, and involve themselves in painful confusion of thought.</p>
      <p> That there is an inner conflict in the bosom of every Christian mind, is put beyond all doubt by the testimony of all the saints in every age. That there is a carnal mind o-ap/co?) even in the regenerate, is emphatically</p>
      
      <p> brought out by the Apostle Paul in describing his own expe rience in the latter part of the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans (vii. 14-25). Though Pelagians, Arminians, and Piomanists oppose that interpretation, there can be no doubt, as Augustine and all the Reformers have conclusively proved, that the apostle in that passage refers to a conflict carried on in his own soul at the time when he penned the Epistle. And this plainly argues that he laid claim to no perfection of holiness within. There was an internal conflict between flesh and spirit—between an old and new nature. And the strange thing is, that in this conflict the powers and faculties of the Christian seem to be occupied at one time by the one, and at another time by the other. The same intel lect, will, and affections come under different influences, like two conflicting armies occupying the ground, and in turn driven from the field. To the astonishment of the Christian himself, the mind and affections engaged in the exercise of holy love by the power of the Holy Spirit, may all of a sudden be turned away by some root of sin or strange law of associa tion in the mental economy to the very opposite; and thus the conflict continues to the end. We may compare it—though no analogy can exactly portray it—to one in a state of convalescence, where disease and health are struggling for the mastery, sometimes the one predominating, sometimes the other, .till the disease is fully and for ever expelled from the veins.</p>
      <p> The apostle draws a distinction, indeed, between his true and proper self and the sin that dwelt in him. But that was not intended to divest himself of responsibility, or to escape from repentance and confession. Rather it was to rise above the dejection of such a constant, unintermitting conflict. He describes a law of sin warring against the law of his mind, constraining the cry for help, as a captive cries, and a divine interposition which sets him free. This is a vivid picture of conflict, of defeat, and then of the Spirit's help given in answer</p>
      
      <p> to his cry for deliverance. The delineation is given in such a way as proves that the flesh resists the Spirit. The resistance is felt whenever we put forth any spiritual activity, like the effort to move a palsied member or a wounded arm ; for when it is passive there is no resistance. In like manner, any holy activity is met by opposition from the opposite conception.</p>
      <p> This exposition will suffice to prove that while the Spirit of holiness is ever active, the measure of attainment is always imperfect and defective. While the Christian presses toward the mark, he is never perfect; nor does he ever reach a stage when there is no more conflict, and no performance of God's will without the consciousness of inward opposition.</p>
      
      <p> LECTURE   VI.</p>
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.</p>
      <p> I  SHALL direct attention in this lecture to the Spirit's work in the Church, first in founding it, and then in making its ordinances available to their true design.</p>
      <p> The Church of Christ, in the days of His flesh, did not, properly speaking, exist, though His word had found entrance into individual souls. It was at Pentecost that the Lord, by the power of His Spirit, welded into a Church the souls on whom the word had exercised a saving efficacy. The Holy Spirit, at the commencement of what is called His " mission," collected the disciples into a living unity; and this great work of the Spirit is called the Church, the kingdom of God, the body of Christ, the temple of the Spirit, the habitation of God in the Spirit (Eph. ii. 22), a conquest from the kingdom of darkness and death. It rises, as a fabric, in all the majesty of its proportions, on the ruins of that empire of rebellion and sin which previously occupied the world. It forms a true city of refuge to all who desire to escape from the tyranny of the destroyer.</p>
      <p> In the apostolic age, the idea of  THE KINGDOM OF GOD,  to which ample allusion is made in the prophets and in our Lord's parables, is less presented to our notice than the idea of  THE CHURCH.  Let me advert to the relation which Christ occupies to the Church as King and Head, and to the place which the Spirit fills in this living organism.</p>
      <p> Here the mediatorial acts of Christ are not to be omitted from our consideration. Thus, in two sayings which may</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IX THE CHURCH.         231</p>
      <p> easily be harmonized, the Lord said: " It is expedient for you that I go away;  for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you" (John xvi. 17); and again: "I will not leave you comfortless [better: orphans] ; I  will come to you "  (John xiv. 18). The two things—the departure and coming—are there conjoined without disharmony or contra diction. The Lord departs, and yet comes ; and the solution of that variety of statement is by no means difficult.</p>
      <p> The influences of the Spirit on the Church are considered by many as emanating rather from the Spirit's proper motion than communicated by Christ, whose deputy He is, according to their economical relations. To obviate this one-sided representation, we have only to recall the Baptist's statement, taken up and repeated by the Lord Himself:  "He shall baptize  you with the Holy Ghost and with fire " (Matt. iii. 11; Acts i. 5). This momentous truth, that Christ baptizes with the Holy Ghost,—in other words, has authority to dis pense the Spirit,—is not to be obscured for the sake of another truth which may, if unduly urged, be made the occasion of introducing the notion of isolated action in the Godhead, than which it is hardly possible to imagine any view more replete with disastrous consequences. All the Persons act indivisibly in every divine act, according to their order in the Trinity.</p>
      <p> An analogy may be traced between the baptism of Christ, by which He was inaugurated into office, and the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, after He received the plenary unction of the Spirit (Acts ii. 33). In a word, these two events indicated two grades of unction, or two stages in the communication of the Spirit to Him. The former, accom panied with the descent of the Spirit, was meant to equip the Redeemer for entering on His office. The latter was intended to found the Christian Church and supply it with the living organs and various gifts, by which it efficiently exercises the spiritual life for the advancement of Christ's cause. The</p>
      
      <p></p>
      <p> 232   THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> Lord Jesus personally abstained from any step of His ministry till the Spirit descended upon Him, and John's baptism introduced Him to His work. The apostles, in like manner, tarried in Jerusalem, as the Lord directed them, till they were endued with power from on high. As a historic fact, the Christian Church came into existence only when the Spirit, by a miraculous effusion, was shed on the assembled multitude of disciples, and constituted them the Church of the Lord. The Twelve were honoured with a peculiar calling, for the execution of which the Spirit furnished them with capacities and endowments. The Church came into being with the ofh'ce-bearers, and was never without the offices and spiritual gifts.</p>
      <p> With the rise of the Christian Church a new epoch dawned; new transforming influences entered into history. They who were called out of the mass of mankind by the sanctification of the Spirit (1 Pet. i. 2) were constituted  THE CHURCH,  a society of believers with a common interest in Christ's re demption and a common hope of glory. As a corporate society, they have communion with the Lord Jesus Christ in His saving blessings, and with all believers in the living Head. The Church, animated by His Holy Spirit, came into existence in virtue of the election of the Father, the re demption of the Son, and the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit. How closely the Spirit is connected with that living organism—its functions, office-bearers, sacraments, gifts, and ordinances—will appear when we call to mind that He creates it by His life-giving agency, sustains and supports it in its functions, infuses life, unction, and ability for the exercises by which the members edify and comfort one another, and without whom it could neither exist nor cohere. By the Holy Spirit, every true member of the Church is consciously joined to the Head; and the several members are held together rather by inward than by outward bonds.</p>
      <p> When   we   examine   the   description   of   the   Church   in</p>
      
      <p> Scripture, we find the emphatic announcement that it is one body, and that one Spirit inhabits and animates it (Eph. iv. 4). The Church has a twofold function, neither side of which can be neglected. It is (1) a  HOLY SOCIETY in the world, maintaining a state of separation from the world, meeting together for the worship of God, and walking according to His will for mutual edification as well as for God's declarative glory ; it is (2)  A MISSIONARY INSTITUTE, with a view to propagate or extend the gospel to them that are without. Let us briefly look at both.</p>
      <p> I. With regard to the Church as  A HOLY SOCIETY  meeting for worship and edification, the Epistles are replete with allusions to this feature. Thus  THE UNITY  of the Church is expressly named when it is said : " There is one body and one Spirit" (Eph. iv. 4). Whether we regard it as living through a succession of economies or existing con temporaneously in the world in many lands, it is  ONE,  a society holding the Head and knit together by the same Spirit; though, at some parts of its history, rather believed than capable of being distinctly traced. All true members of the Church, because joined to the Lord, are one Spirit (1 Cor. vi. 17), however differing in language, country, or condition; while they who are without the Spirit cannot be regarded as true members of the Church, because not animated by its vital principle. The Church is ONE not in consequence of its efforts after union,—nor in virtue of the mutual harmony which pervades its different parts, for these are but fruits and pledges of a previous unity in the Lord,—but in virtue of the one indwelling Spirit.</p>
      <p> From the essential relation in which it stands to Christ, the Church, moreover, is described under figures, which will more appropriately aid our conceptions of its nature than all other definitions put together. Besides the striking figure already named, that of  one lody and one Spirit,  it is</p>
      
      <p> called  the bride of Christ,  showing a mutual relation, a perpetual union, and a preparation for the final perfection (Eev. xix. 7 ; 2 Cor. xi. 2), a  temple,  or habitation compacted together,—of which Christ is the foundation and chief corner stone, and each member is a living stone (1 Pet. ii. o),  the vine  and branches,—one vital principle sustaining the whole (John xv. 1-G).</p>
      <p> These illustrations suffice to prove that Christians are a corporate society, a habitation of God in the Spirit, and that lie truly dwells by His Spirit, as He dwelt in the temple of Jerusalem, by clear pledges of His presence. The assemblies of Christians, replenished by His Spirit, are His temple, where He dwells in a more glorious manner than in Israel (2 Cor. iii. 7). That this is the import of the allusion is obvious from the elucidation which the apostle subjoins from the Old Testament Scriptures (2 Cor. vi. 16-18). For He warns them against such as preached the wisdom of men instead of the revelation of divine grace ; and declares the culpable character of their proceedings by allusion to the inhabitation of the Holy Spirit, who condescends to dwell among His people and to walk in them, and to make them the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty.</p>
      <p> The four epithets applied to the Church in the Nicseno-Constantinopolitan Creed may be accepted without hesitation as furnishing the marks of the Church, viz.  ONE, HOLY, CATHOLIC,  and  APOSTOLIC CHURCH.  But, without expatiating on these predicates in detail, let me notice that the Church, as a living organism, enjoys the inhabitation of the Holy Ghost, and makes itself felt in society in a great variety of ways. It is invisible, so far as it rests on the gracious operations of the Spirit. But that distinction between the visible and invisible Church, proper enough,—nay, necessary in connec tion with the points involved in the Itomish controversy,— was never meant to paralyze the hands of those who labour, within due bounds, to conform the Church to the standard</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IX THE CHURCH.         235</p>
      <p> and ideal presented to us in apostolic Christianity. The Church, animated by the Spirit, evinces its vitality and influence in every sphere.</p>
      <p> The connection of the individual with the Church rests on the possession of true faith,  or effectual calling by the Holy Spirit. According to the Protestant distinction, as it has been happily formulated, it is the believer's relation to Christ that puts him in connection with the Church ; not his con nection with the Church that puts him into a saving relation to Christ. And to this universal Church belong all of every age and country who have been engrafted into Christ by the Spirit, whether they are of the Church militant or of the Church triumphant. The four constituents or essential qualities which come to light in connection with the Church as an organized body, may be briefly noticed before we pro ceed to describe the Spirit's agency.</p>
      <p> 1.   The  constitution  of the Church was the form according to which the apostles, as the organs of a plenary inspiration, moulded the Christian society.    And the whole discussion on the true organization of the Church has always turned on the one question, Which form is the most close resemblance to the apostolic model ?    A constitution of some kind has always been deemed necessary; and apostolic  sanction, at least in its great outlines, has never been denied to it.</p>
      <p> 2.   The    element  of  worship,  another  constituent   of   the Church, is  that exercise  of the assembled congregation by which the holy priesthood, in a befitting   way, by the aid of the Spirit, approaches God through the intercession  of the High Priest of our profession, and offers not external sacri fices, which have all been abolished by the one  valid and accepted  sacrifice, but themselves as living sacrifices (Eom. xii. 1).    And  their  praises, thanksgivings, and prayers,—the fruit  of   their lips,—are represented   as   spiritual   sacrifices acceptable   to  God   by Jesus   Christ   (1   Pet.   ii.   5 ;   Heb. xiii. 15).</p>
      
      <p> 3.   Confession  is another constituent of the Church.    The Christian body replenished with the Holy Ghost, expresses a common testimony, or the   consciousness  of holding a sum of knowledge or of truth based upon the apostles' doctrine (Acts ii. 42).    And this is so connected with the exercise of faith that  the two  are   as  inseparable  in the   Christian society, as in the case of the individual who believes with the heart and makes confession with  the mouth (Horn. x.  10). Faith assimilates to itself the objective word of God in such a way that it reproduces that word in the form of a common confession through the influence of the Holy Spirit.     It  is the Spirit of life that enables the Church to find the adequate expression.     On this topic let me add, that only extensive advances in the doctrine and life of the Church render a new Confession warrantable.    And as the enlarged experience which sheds increased light on the various truths of revelation not seldom runs parallel with the rise of new errors, the Church has generally to do two things—present a negative side to error, and fill the foreground with positive truth.    Theology is made subservient only so far as to furnish the due expres sion for the truth held by all in common.</p>
      <p> 4.   Discipline,  a fourth  constituent  of the  Church,  is an important addition  or appendix  to the  other three, for the removal of scandals and for the correction of those who incur censure.    The  Reformed  Church   warrantably made   this  a constituent  of the  Church   as  well   as  the   others  already named.    Writers   in   foreign   Churches,  like   Guericke   and others, do  not scruple   to   condemn   the  Churches of   the Reformed  as   receding from  the   sound  idea  of   a  Church, and in so far approaching to that of Borne, as they include the elements of discipline and constitution as well as word and sacrament among the  conditions or constituents of the Church.    These views are a forgetfulness of the fact that the laws of Christ are to be administered under the solemn charge of responsibility to Him ; and His approving salutation at last</p>
      
      <p> will be based only on faithfulness to Him. To neglect this constituent element, as has been proved by all history, is only to forfeit purity and spiritual influence. Of this the Greek Church is a striking monument. Her downfall to the lowest degradation is traced by Sozomen—one of her own historians —to the dilapidation of her discipline.</p>
      <p> How are we to explain Christ's presence in the Church along with the Spirit's agency ? Many of the theories on the mode of Christ's presence—in Patristic, Eomish, Lutheran, and Anglican theology—would never have been agitated, or would even now be sopited, if these relations had been duly considered and understood by the controversialists on both sides.</p>
      <p> Christ's activity as Lord and Head of the Church seems at first sight to militate against the action of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and conversely. That these important aspects of truth may not have the appearance of coming into collision, let me refer to their relation. The regulation of the Church's life—sometimes spoken of as if it were retained in Christ's own hand, sometimes described as if it were committed to the Holy Spirit—must be regarded as two announcements of the same great truth, without any difference, two sides of one and the same thing. The Lord Jesus, the Mediator, does all by the Holy Spirit in fostering, quickening, guiding the Church; and so intimately are these two things conjoined, — the Melchizedek-priesthood on the one hand, and the dispensa tion of the Spirit on the other,—that they must constantly be seen together (Acts ii. 33). The exalted Christ continuously acts for the Church's good by His Spirit through the word.</p>
      <p> Where these two doctrines are sundered in the theological conceptions of individuals or bodies of men, it is to the pre judice of right views of Christ's Person, and to the deteriora tion of sound views of the sacraments. Thus the Lutheran Church, to maintain her peculiar views of the Lord's Supper, is compelled to lay emphasis on the alleged ubiquity of</p>
      
      <p> Christ's humanity. But by so doing they evacuate the Spirit's work in that proportion. The Lord's own teaching is that He acts by the Spirit on His Church, and that  He is present not by the ubiquity of His human nature, but  ~by His omni present Spirit, who is at once in Him and in us,  as a perpetual bond or link. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the Church —that is, of Christ by the Spirit whom He obtained by His obedience, and confers from His throne — constitutes the Church's glory.</p>
      <p> To put Christ's own  OMNIPRESENCE  in its proper light, it is necessary to remark that it is one of the perfections of His immutable divine nature—a fact belonging to Him as a divine Person, and that cannot be more or less. It is not a matter of promise, but a fact, an inalienable fact. But His GRACIOUS PRESENCE,  as the Incarnate One, is matter of promise, and may or may not be according to His relations with His people; and when Christ promised to be with His Church subsequently to the ascension, He intimated not so much His divine omnipresence as a presence by the Spirit— as must be evident to every mind that duly considers the above-mentioned statement. His presence with His people involved gracious privilege, which might be imparted or with held according to His good pleasure or the emergencies of His Church. And He gave His disciples to understand in His last discourses, that, without the agency of the Holy Spirit, the New Testament Church could neither come into existence nor be perpetuated in the world. Nor was the promise of the Spirit's presence limited to public occasions or to external institutions. Christ is there undoubtedly by His Spirit. But His presence while felt there by His living disciples, is not bound to more public occasions, nor to ecclesiastical institutions, as its exclusive sphere.</p>
      <p> According to the mediatorial economy, based on the order of the Trinity, Christ sends the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, as His deputy. There is no isolated action among the Persons</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IX THE CHURCH.         239</p>
      <p> of the Godhead, and cannot be, because they all equally par ticipate in the divine essence, and act according to their order of subsistence in all divine acts. Where the one is, there the others are. This fundamental axiom, in which every intelli gent Trinitarian must concur, enables us to obviate those half-truths which are incautiously admitted in the Churches.</p>
      <p> The action of Christ and of His Spirit, conjoined, comes vividly before us in all the services and worship of the Church. When the Lord uttered the memorable words: " Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (Matt, xviii. 20), He intimated that by the Spirit He would inhabit ordinances, and make His presence consciously felt. According to the scriptural view of worship, the company of the disciples, depending on Christ's merits, and conscious that by one Spirit they are all baptized into one body and made to drink into one Spirit (1 Cor. xii. 13), has to continue, as in the first days of the Christian Church, stedfast in the apostles' doctrine and fellow ship, and in breaking of bread and in prayers (Acts ii. 42).</p>
      <p> According to this economy,  CHRIST  is  PRESENT BY  His SPIRIT,  conducting the communications of God to man, and the worship of man to God, the channel of divine supplies to us, and the medium by which the returns of praise, prayer, service, and obedience are acceptably offered. The Holy Spirit acts in both respects as the Comforter or Deputy in Christ's name, filling His mystic body and presenting their spiritual sacrifices (1 Pet. ii. 5). This view of worship to which the action of the High Priest and the aid of the Spirit are absolutely essential, is brought out in a memorable psalm: " I will declare Thy name to my brethren ; in the midst of the Church will I praise Thee" (Ps. xxii. 22 ; Heb. ii. 12). The Lord Jesus acts from God to us and from us to God, in both instances by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> This view of Church-worship is vitiated in two opposite ways to the manifest injury of the doctrine of the Spirit—</p>
      
      <p> !MO   THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> (1) by a blighting Ritualism, and (2) by an evacuating theory not less blighting. Ritualism, Romish or Anglican, agrees in making the Church's action a substitute for the action of Christ and His Spirit. On whatever ground it is placed, whether it represents the Church's action as a perpetual con tinuation of Christ's life on earth, and therefore a sort of perpetual incarnation, which was Mohler's theory, or describes the Church's action as meritorious and propitiatory, which is the common theory, it entirely ignores the operation of the Spirit of God, and binds the results to a mere array of forms. It makes the ever - acting High Priest a mere inactive spectator, and is irrespective of the Spirit's grace and of the receiver's faith. The whole transaction is lodged in other hands. Ritualism conjoins the sacraments and the Spirit in such a sense that the dispensation of the one is equivalent to the communication of the other.</p>
      <p> An opposite extreme is the false spiritualism which makes the sacraments but empty signs. Too many in the Reformed Churches, under the spell of an evacuating system which the Germans call Zwinglianism, have gone far to denude sacra ments of the Spirit's presence, as if there were no sacramental union between the sign and the thing signified. That there is no virtue in the mere emblems, or in the administrator, is as true on the one side, as it is true on the other side that there is the blessing of Christ and the working of His Spirit to them that by faith receive them. Mr. Stowel, for example, in his work on the Spirit, assails a theory applicable to every Church in Christendom, and one which he owns was not abandoned by the Puritans of England nor by the Non conformist clergy, in these terms : " If by means of grace," says he, " no more be meant than states of mind in which the Spirit gives us grace, and the connection of such states of mind with the instructions of teachers, and with offices of devotion believingly attended to, we should be only fastidious in taking exception to such language; but if it be the old</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         241</p>
      <p> Church-doctrine of  media gratice,  the notion that  through these means as channels and instruments the Holy Ghost works invisibly within men—against that notion, by whatever words conveyed, we must gravely and conscientiously protest. Neither the Scriptures nor the Christian's experience permit us to doubt that prayer for what God has promised, offered with faith in His promise, is followed by the blessing prayed for; and the history of Christianity abounds with proofs of some established connection between the preaching of the word and the salvation of men's souls. But who that ponders the meaning of words can believe that either prayers or preaching is the means through which the actual gift of salvation is conveyed ? It can be no disparagement of so vital an exercise as prayer, to conceive of it as being what it really is, the address of the devout heart to God, but not the channel of God's grace to man. Neither can it be any dis paragement of the preaching of the gospel to regard it as being what it really is, the truth of God addressed to men, but not the vehicle of the Spirit  by which man is prepared to receive the message with the faith whereby we are saved " (p. 223).</p>
      <p> These are unhappy views, and too widely diffused, repudiat ing the theory that the Spirit of God imparts the grace of regeneration through the Church, and the notion of spiritual power belonging to an outward institution. But the gospel is the ministration of the Spirit, and we may maintain that the word and sacraments are made the vehicle or channel of conveying what they announce. These are evacuating prin ciples unknown to the theology of the Reformation and of the Puritanic age as well as to Patristic literature. A false spiritualism separating itself from sacraments and ordinances which God instituted as the channels through which His Spirit is conferred, would, if carried out to its legitimate con sequences, lead to a treatment of the sacraments as if they were a superfluous form. The view which Calvin propounded</p>
      
      <p> as a safe middle ground was: That sacraments do not impart grace  (ex opcre opcrato]  by their mere administration, but that they are not mere barren signs  (nuda siyna);  that they are channels of blessing to every believing recipient; the blessing being given by Christ's own hand, and through the working of the Spirit to them that by faith receive them.</p>
      <p> Here it may be proper to show that it is  ONE CHURCH OF GOD  under a different guise in the Old Testament and in the New. The same Spirit of faith filled the heart of believers, whether they lived before or after the advent of Christ (2 Cor. iv. 13). The Trinitarian relations were the same; and the divine perfections in the matter of our salvation were exhibited in the same w r ay. The sacraments, it is true, were changed more than once to be adapted to different epochs in the history of redemption. Their efficacy, however, was the same through the power of the Spirit in every economy to all that by faith received them. On this point the Churches of the  Reformation  were for a time at one in opposition to the Romish doctrine, that the sacraments of the Old Testament were but types of those of the New Testament; that the former communicated nothing, and that the latter conveyed blessings in the mere order of operation. The Reformers maintained without exception, that in both economies the sacraments were identical in import and efficacy. "With the Romanists it had long been a dogma that the sacraments of the Israelitish dispensation were only shadows of those instituted for the Christian Church. All the Protestant Churches with one consent maintained the opposite till a different view began to be propounded among the Lutherans. But down to the time of Chemnitzius we find it held as an accepted opinion in opposition to the Romanists, that there was no essential difference in the sacraments of the two economies. That eminent Lutheran theologian maintained that there was no other grace and no other faith by which men were saved in the Old Testament than that grace and</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIEIT IN THE CHURCH.         243</p>
      <p> faith by which men are saved in the New, and no real differ ence between the spiritual efficacy of the sacraments in the two economies. A general assent was given in the Lutheran and Reformed Churches to the doctrine laid down by Augustin, that the only difference between the sacraments of the two economies was, that those in the Old Testament announced a Saviour about to come, while those of the New Testament announced a Saviour already come. In process of time, Lutheran divines began to modify the common Pro testant doctrine; and step by step, by one concession after another, they found themselves constrained, by the necessities of their new position, to drop their confession to the essential identity, and to the equal spiritual efficacy, of the sacraments of both economies. They began to assert, with the Romanists, that the sacraments of the Old Testament were but a type or shadow of the sacraments of the New Testament. In the same way Anglican Ritualists are wont to expound their sentiments. The Reformed Churches never wavered. With Calvin, they have all continued to assert that the covenant of grace was substantially the same, though economically different in form. They never conceded that in the Old Testament there was only type or shadow, and nothing of reality. They maintained that under the Old Testament believers not less really apprehended Christ's atoning sacrifice than is done by believers now, though it was exhibited to them in another way than to us in the New Testament sacraments.</p>
      <p> II. Let me now advert to the Church as  A MISSIONARY INSTITUTE,  and to the work which the Holy Spirit conde scends to discharge in connection with the ingathering of new disciples, with the propagation of the gospel, and the revival of religion. It may be noticed that there are three titles,— ministers of Christ, ministers of the gospel, ministers of the Church,—which are an exhaustive exhibition of the office (Col. i.), and that there is an exercise of the Spirit's power</p>
      
      <p> through them analogous to that which was exercised on the day of Pentecost. The union of disciples in prayer and supplication, and in waiting for the promise of the Father, is also analogous, and never to be interrupted. The instru ments by whom the Spirit works are also prepared for service in a similar way, only without the miraculous accompani ments. They are Christians first, and then called to official labour.</p>
      <p> The rich supply of extraordinary  GIFTS  bestowed at Pente cost was not intended to continue when they had served their purpose in founding the Christian Church. The other gifts of an ordinary character were given for the permanent advantage of the Church, and are so essential to her edifica tion, that, without them, she would collapse or disappear. Their continuance is a constant proof that Christ lives as the dispenser of the Holy Spirit. Some of them are gifts of office —and of every conceivable variety—for acting on the mind of others, while the general body of Christians is supplied with gifts and endowments, wealth and influence, which the Spirit induces them to wield for the common benefit. The perma nence of the Church does not depend on offices alone, as Irving and Lb'he represented the matter, nor on gifts alone, as the Plymouth Brethren will have it, but on both conjoined.</p>
      <p> Every minister truly called to office by the Spirit of God has a gift which may be described as innate, but brought to light and activity by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Fundamentally, it is a natural or concreated endow ment, but called into exercise by the Spirit for the good of the Church, and fitting the possessors to do a work which no other can do so well; and the conscious possession of which should have a twofold effect, should disengage their mind from all tendency to envy the gifts of others, and to be discontented with their own.</p>
      <p> The first disciples were called to wait in the attitude of humble supplicants for the power with which they were to be</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         245</p>
      <p> endued by the Holy Spirit coming upon them (Acts i. 8) ; and we have there an example of what is ever to be re produced. Before this they evinced ignorance and prejudice, timidity and shrinking from the cross, ambition and pride. After the descent of the Spirit there was no more debate who should be the greatest; they forgot self, and rose to an eleva tion previously unknown. They imbibed new ideas of the spirituality of Christ's kingdom. The Spirit brought all things back to their remembrance. The instruments that the Spirit formed felt that they are rather passive than active in the whole work—tools in another's hand.</p>
      <p> Here we must refer to  THE MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT  (2 Cor. iii. 8). With regard to this remarkable expression, it may denote one of two things. It may mean—(1) that the Holy Spirit, as the author of the ministry in its manifold varieties, constitutes the offices, raises up the men, and endows them with their rich variety of gifts; or (2) it may mean, as I rather think, that the gospel ministry, whether in the hand of the apostles—the chief functionaries—or of ordinary office bearers, is exercised with the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven. The expression will thus convey the thought that the Spirit gives the spiritual and edifying effect along with the gifts and ordinances which have been appointed in the Church. In speaking of the union between these ordinances and the Spirit's accompany ing power, precision is necessary in order to avoid excess of statement on the one hand, and defect of statement on the other. An examination of the Acts of the Apostles discovers to us the Spirit's present operation everywhere along with the preaching of the gospel. And whenever the veil is lifted up, the reader gets a glimpse into the movements of the kingdom of God, and into the unseen agency of the Spirit, which is everywhere declared. And from this we infer His ever present activity in all centuries and localities alike. The Church has not been left to herself.</p>
      
      <p> We find united the greatest apparent opposites: weakness and power, emptiness and sufficiency, limitation and the boundless resources of omnipotence, the earthen vessel ready to go to pieces at the slightest pressure and the excellency of power, an unimposing agency with the mightiest force that stirs humanity; in a word, what Milton calls " the un-resistihle might of weakness," or what the prophet calls the worm Jacob thrashing the mountains and beating them small. The ministry is so connected with the Spirit that the human speaker is but the instrument, and He the hand that moves them; and nothing remains to man but the labour.</p>
      <p> An inscrutable sovereignty appears in dispensing the divine blessing, and in founding the Church in any locality (Acts ii. 1, xi. 20). This appears even in connection with an apostle. It may be proper, at the outset, to say that success did not lie within his resources or appliances in such a sense that it could be made the subject of human calculation; that the increase was of God (1 Cor. i. 6); and that men cannot dispense blessings at their discretion. While that is one side of a great truth, it is not to be denied that the preacher must have an organic aptitude for his office, or be a fit instrument. And, among other things comprehended in this,—such as personal consecration, dependence on God's Spirit, incessant prayer, and the like,—it is commonly the man imbued with the greatest desire for fruit who most plentifully reaps it.</p>
      <p> Here the question may be raised : Has any connection been divinely established between the Spirit's exercise of saving power and the proclamation of reconciliation or redemption by the cross? It is a momentous question, but capable of a distinct answer. We must distinguish. On the one hand, God never puts the blessings of salvation out of His own hand into the hand of others, nor diffuses the operations of His Spirit by any other channel than in the line of His electing purpose. On the other hand,  a connection is established between the preaching of reconciliation by the cross and the exercise of the S}nrit's power, to</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         247</p>
      <p> an extent that cannot be affirmed of any other type of doctrine.  In making this statement, we are neither treading on the region of mystery, nor treading insecurely—for we have the guidance of the divine word. The apostle says: " This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith, that is, the preaching of faith " (aKorj  TTicrreeo?); a statement intimating that the Spirit had been received by the Galatians, not in connection with a doctrine which laid stress on ritual observances or a more moral code legally enforced, but in connection with the proclamation of redemption by the blood of Christ, and received by faith. To human view, indeed, no obvious link of connection can be perceived between that style of preaching and the transform ing power of the Holy Spirit. But a divine connection does exist, as is there explicitly declared. When the apostle calls the gospel "the power of God" (Kom. i. 16), and the preach ing of Christ crucified "the power of God" (1 Cor. i. 24), we have a statement which explicitly affirms that the  DIVINE POWER  of the Spirit goes associated with the proclamation of the atonement, but will not be associated with a style of teaching which substitutes any other theme.</p>
      <p> The first and most momentous question is: On what footing does the preacher take men up in reference to the Judge of all the earth, and what is the specific which he brings home to them as adequate to meet their case  1  Where an uncertain sound is given on  KUIN, EEDEMPTION,  and  EEGENE-RATION,  the sinner fails to recognise himself in the mirror held up to him. There is nothing to bring him into the divine presence, or to bring home the pointed address, " Thou art the man." Nothing can be named as more important than the precision with which the line is drawn between law and gospel, which was the distinctive feature of the Pauline theology, and the restoration of which was the great achievement of the Reformation, which, after the long torpor of ages, brought back preaching to the place it occupied in</p>
      
      <p> apostolic times. Without that distinction, preaching loses its edge. The law is enforced on the impenitent, and the gospel commended to the contrite. The Reformation made this distinction familiar to all men as a household word, and gave it the prominence that belongs to it.</p>
      <p> The Church is gathered in any given locality only where Christ crucified is preached. This held true in the founding of the Church at first, and holds true in the planting of it in any heathen land. And the same doctrine which formed it is necessary to sustain it from age to age; for, as Luther happily expressed it, the article of Justification is the article of a standing or falling Church. The only security of the Church is to give no uncertain sound on the great doctrines of Christianity; the deep-seated ruin of mankind and their vast guilt; the Deity, the mission, and atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ; the necessity of regeneration by the Holy Ghost; the need of forgiving grace ; the assurance of salva tion ; the tenor of the covenant of grace. " I am not sensible," said Dr. Chalmers, when referring to the actual though undesigned experiment which he prosecuted for upwards of twelve years in Kilmany, " that all the vehemence with which I urged the virtues and the proprieties of social life had the weight of a feather on the moral habits of my parishioners. And it was not till I got impressed by the utter alienation of the heart in all its desires and affections from God; it was not till reconciliation to Him became the distinct and the prominent object of my ministerial exertions ; it was not till I took the scriptural way of laying the method of reconciliation before them; it was not till the free offer of forgiveness through the blood of Christ was urged upon their acceptance, and the Holy Spirit given, through the channel of Christ's Mediatorship, to all who ask Him was set before them as the unceasing object of their dependence and their prayers; it was not, in one word, till the contemplations of my people were turned to these great and essential elements</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         249</p>
      <p> in the business of a soul providing for its interest with God and the concerns of its eternity, that I ever heard of any of those subordinate reformations which I aforetime made the earnest and the zealous, but I am afraid at the same time the ultimate, object of my earlier ministrations." 1  My object in adducing this remarkable experience is to show an instance how the preacher who withholds the doctrine of the cross and the immediate reconciliation with God, which must always go along with it, whether the silence is due to the fact that the preacher's own mind has never adequately been awakened to discern its value, or acts upon a system of reserve without making the central doctrine of Christianity bear on man's relation to the Judge of all—fails to wield any power. The opposite doctrine awakens souls, is associated with the Holy Spirit, and plants or propagates the Church.</p>
      <p> I shall briefly advert to  THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN A RELIGIOUS AWAKENING.  Though this cannot be made the subject of human calculation, we find it occurring sometimes in a con tinuous ingathering of individuals, sometimes in a multitude of simultaneous conversions, or in great movements which carry with them the marks of a genuine work of the Holy Spirit. Many things may occur of a mixed character in an exciting period of religious effervescence. The opinion of a large class, who betray a lack of spiritual discernment and an incapacity to form a judgment as to its nature and tendency, will always be received with little deference. They who are wedded to a theory of development, are in danger of denying any interposi tion of the Spirit from on high. Others, embarrassed by a system of sacramental grace by which they allow their minds to be swayed, mistake a movement which overleaps these barriers and marches forward in a path of its own. And having adopted a principle with which a religious awakening on a large scale will not coincide, they run the risk of denying it as a legitimate religious phenomenon. Any system which</p>
      
      <p> has no place for the universal priesthood of believers is prone to look askance on an outpouring of the Spirit connected with the immediate action of the Church's living Head on His</p>
      <p> o</p>
      <p> disciples. An awakening of this more general kind consti tutes for the most part a new epoch with a well-defined peculiarity, and is replete with great results. The gleaner in Church history, at a subsequent stage, estimates its influence on thought, on action, and on ecclesiastical life as at the Reformation, when the effusion of the Holy Spirit was more marked than at any previous period from the apostolic age. The effusion of the Spirit in the Puritanic age, followed as it was by the cognate movement of Spener and Francke in the German Churches, exercised an influence, the force of which continued long, nay, continues to this day. The great awaken ing of last century, pervading England, Scotland, and America, under Whitefield, Wesley, and Edwards, gave rise to those Bible, missionary, and tract societies which still continue in the Churches. Only under such influences can a solvent be found powerful enough for producing such results.</p>
      <p> The work of the Spirit, wherever it occurs, requires to be discriminated from its accompaniments and from the counter feits that may be expected. It is asked, Can these be genuine cases of conversion where the whole is effected in an hour, and where the mind passes with astonishing rapidity from deep conviction to triumphant faith ? We reply, it is not a question of time, but of thoroughness and intensity. That a man, and a multitude of men, may under the overwhelming pressure of conviction consequent on a manifestation of God's holiness and inviolable law, and of that utter ruin and boundless guilt in which men are involved, be shut up by the Spirit to Christ within the space of an hour or two, while not a characteristic of a sound conversion and not a single fruit of the Spirit are found to be awanting, is proved by the evidence of facts. But the sudden deliverance of the converts from the dangerous errors in which they previously lived, receives an explanation in the same</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         251</p>
      <p> way. At such a moment, when men come under deep convic tions, the previous cavils against the doctrines of the gospel are found to pass away like a cloud; the Arminian accepts election; the Arian, the Deity of Christ and the atonement; the Eomanist, the sole mediatorship of Christ, without hesi tation.</p>
      <p> But it is further asked, How can cases of conversion be admitted, when they receive impressions, amid their common avocations, suddenly and without any special application of the word ? I answer, There is no need for asserting that the word is not employed: as the sword of the Spirit, the word is used in every case. The word, deposited in the heart from childhood, and quickened by the addresses, conversations, or providences which lead to the decisive issue, may have occupied the mind before the convictions reached their climax.</p>
      <p> Many things occur which all too plainly prove that it is necessary not only to pray for an awakening, but for wisdom equal to the occasion when it is imparted. Mere religious excitement is no unchallengeable evidence of the genuineness of a spiritual awakening, nor any passport to the confidence of the Christian community, unless it be conclusively proved that divine truth—that is, the word of God in what may be called the true outline of that word—was the means of pro ducing it. If not called forth by the instrumentality of divine truth, it may be little better than a spurious medley, or a spasmodic movement by mere human appliances.</p>
      <p> It is not to be expected, indeed, that no tares will be mingled with the wheat, or that there will be no over-hasty admissions or over-confident assertions as to numbers, no exhibition of converts prematurely thrust into public notice, no censorious judgments, no noisy profession followed by a fall. It would not be a work of God if there were no imita tions, for where the Spirit builds a church, Satan builds a chapel. The tests which Shepherd adduces in his treatise on</p>
      
      <p> the parable of the ten virgins, or which Edwards employs in his work on the religious affections, though they cannot be applied in the early stages of a religious awakening, when the two classes cannot be distinguished from each other, ought never to be absent from the mind of those who are called to guide a religious movement.</p>
      <p> These memorable seasons are to be hailed as interpositions of the Spirit's power. " It may be observed," says Edwards, 1 " that from the fall of man to our day, the work of redemp tion in its effect has mainly been carried on by remarkable communications of the Spirit of God. Though there be a more constant influence of God's Spirit always in some degree attending His ordinances, yet the way in which the greatest things have been done towards carrying on this work always has been by remarkable effusions at special seasons of mercy." The Church's ever-living Head knows how to usher in creative epochs, to rally His people to some converging point through the lapse of centuries, and to gather up under this powerful influence isolated opinions into one consistent whole. When a former awakening has spent its force, when the elements of thought or action previously supplied threaten to become effete,  a new impulse is commonly communicated by Him who interposes at various stages to make all things new. The previous condition of things is commonly such as renders a new sect or a new organization well-nigh inevitable. In a dead or stagnant period, such as prevailed at the time of the formation of not a few of the existing Churches, the spiritual life found no welcome within the pale of the denomination from which the separation w r as made. But when existing Churches take up the new life by a process of assimilation, they are recruited by numbers and refreshed by a new stream of divine life.</p>
      <p> In a devotional publication of Neander, on our Lord's entrance into Jerusalem, he points out that the kingdom of God</p>
      <p> 1   History of Redemption,  Period I. part 1.</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         253</p>
      <p> comes at first as the leaven or as the grain of mustard seed ; but that when it has continued to work for a season in this hidden way, the effect next becomes perceptible in great facts, which force themselves on men's notice and form the great moving powers in the world's history. He adds, to suppose that the kingdom of God must always be as the leaven, would be as great an error as to conclude that the visible results come first. Men look on with awe and wonder when some supply of the Spirit, of which they can neither tell the laws nor estimate the momentum, breaks forth from the kingdom of God and sweeps over the community.</p>
      <p> Without entering into other things involved in this theme, let me close with a few words on two points which, more than any other, give tone and colour to a time of general awakening.</p>
      <p> 1. As to the peculiar mode of preaching, to which the instruments employed are usually led, it largely partakes of the inculcation of immediate conversion. While all the other truths are brought out connected with law and grace, the ruin and the remedy, the occasion naturally leads the preacher to urge the necessity of the great change, and the duty of immediate compliance with all those awakening motives that go to determine the choice. The criminality of every hour's delay is enforced by the thought that it is another hour's rebellion. This must be accompanied with the further state ment, that  without the Holy Ghost they cannot turn ;  that they must, and yet cannot; that they are under obligation, and yet helplessly unable;—a double motive brought to bear upon the mind together, which has been remarkably owned in the preaching of America, and fitted to drive from every refuge those who choose for themselves some middle ground or debateable land where in the meantime they may rest. At this point this preaching conies in with overwhelming force. It shuts up the sinner under a twofold motive—of obligation and inability. It compels action and dependence. It brings</p>
      
      <p> a twofold force to bear on the secure. These two truths must go together; for the one without the other deprives the enforcement of conversion of its power. Withhold a sense of man's dependence, or tell him that whenever he pleases God is ready to second his efforts, and the entire force of every motive is removed. But tell him that all his actions are at the best but the efforts of an enemy till his nature is changed, and that God is, notwithstanding all these efforts, under no obligation to any unconverted man; let him feel the force of both motives,—the present duty, the awful issues that enter into his choice, the utter inability to turn, the absolute free dom and sovereignty of God to give or to withhold His renew ing Spirit,—and there is nothing more calculated to shut up the mind to immediate submission. He must, yet cannot turn. He must, yet cannot convert himself. Whitefield, referring to the effects of this style of American preaching, says: " After they have done all, God may deny them mercy. It is for preaching in this manner that I like the Messrs. Tennent. They wound deeply before they heal. They know that there is no promise but to him that believeth." Such is White-field's testimony, than which we could not have a higher. Dr. Griffin accounts for the numerous revivals in America from the belief of an instantaneous regeneration, and the sinfulness of every moral effort up to that moment, and the duty of immediate submission.</p>
      <p> 2. As to the peculiar mode of praying, we may say that in every season of general awakening the Christian community waits just as they waited for the effusion of the Spirit, with one accord in prayer and supplication, in the interval between the Ascension and Pentecost. No other course has been prescribed; and the Church of the present has all the warrant she ever had to wait, expect, and pray. The first disciples waited in the youthfulness of simple hope, not for a spirit which they had not, but for more of the Spirit which they had; and Christianity has not outlived itself. The attitude</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CHURCH.         255</p>
      <p> of the Church in the first days after the Ascension, when the disciples waited for the Spirit, should be the Church's attitude still. And no more mischievous and misleading theory could be propounded, nor any one more dishonouring to the Holy Spirit, than the principle that because the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost, the Church has no need, and no warrant, to pray any more for the effusion of the Spirit of God. On the contrary, the more the Church asks the Spirit and waits for His communications, the more she receives. 1</p>
      <p> 1  A remarkable passage on prayer, and on working by the power of prayer, occurs in Foster's essay on the application of the epithet " Romantic : " "I am convinced," says he, "that every man who, amidst his serious projects, is apprised of his dependence on God, as completely as that dependence is a fact, will be impelled to pray, and anxious to induce his serious friends to pray, almost every hour. He will as little without it promise himself any noble success, as a mariner would expect to reach a distant coast by having his sails spread in a stagnation of air. 1 have intimated my fear that it is visionary to expect any unusual success in the human administration of religion unless there are unusual omens ; now a most emphatical spirit of prayer would be such an omen ; and the individual who should solemnly determine to try its last possible efficacy, might probably find himself becoming a much more prevailing agent in his little sphere. And if the whole, or the greater number of the disciples of Christianity were, with an earnest, unalterable determination of each, to combine that heaven should not withhold one single influence, which the very utmost of conspiring and persevering supplication would obtain, it would be the sign that a revolution of the world was at hand."</p>
      
      <p> THIRD   DIVISION.</p>
      <p> HISTORICAL SURVEY OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> IT only remains for me, in this last division, to subjoin as briefly as possible a historic outline of the development of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and a sketch of the dis cussions which it has undergone in the course of centuries.</p>
      <p> *D</p>
      <p> The history of this doctrine touches theology at so many points, sometimes in connection with the Trinity, sometimes with inspiration, sometimes with the doctrines of grace, at other times with the Person and mediation of Christ, that, were we to attempt a survey of all these debates, there is scarcely a point in the whole field of polemical theology or Church history which we should not be compelled to traverse. We must fix our eye on the salient points, therefore, and on the marked epochs in the history of the doctrine, that we may not be engulfed in details personal, dogmatic, or eccle siastical. History, with its parallel testimony to Scripture, has a great importance which is not to be ignored; and it must be borne in mind that certain points of the doctrine at one time come more prominently into view, and others at another; that this topic at one time acquires interest, and that it falls again comparatively into abeyance.</p>
      <p> In the very earliest Christian literature,—that is, in the Apostolic Fathers,—and in the Epistle of Clemens especially, we find that the allusions to the Holy Spirit are all in the interest of spiritual religion, and by no means polemical (Clem. chap. xlvi.). The circular letter issued by the Church of Smyrna after Polycarp's death is of the same nature. The</p>
      
      <p> whole doctrine of the Spirit was at that time practical. The doctrine of the Spirit was accepted from the earliest age as au elementary truth in connection with the baptismal formula by young and old, by learned and unlearned. This formula was a rudimentary truth to every baptized man: for there never was a time when a Christian disciple did not confess the Deity and saving work of all the three Persons of the Godhead—that is, when he was not thoroughly instructed as a catechumen in the doctrine of the Trinity, and accepted it as a primary truth with the first profession of Christianity. In the Creed, which was only an echo of the baptismal for mula, the Christian Church, from the first, over all her borders, never hesitated to declare: " I believe in the Holy Ghost," and Christians were guided by this rule in the course of ages to find their way through all the Trinitarian contro versies—the Church simply appealing to that baptismal for mula, and applying it for the refutation of every single error on the subject of the Trinity.</p>
      <p> The doctrine of the Spirit was for a considerable time unassailed. The early Fathers, having no occasion to define the topic, as was done at a later time, simply speak of the Spirit as a divine Person. As regards the article of the Spirit, the doctrine of the Marcionites formed a marked anti thesis to what the Church had always maintained; and this led to a style of language which the Nicasno-Constantino-politan Creed retains to this day. The erratic leader of the sect, Marcion, in his violent polemic against the Old Testa ment and the God of the Old Testament, made use of lan guage disavowed by all Christian men. He represented the Old Testament as the production of the subordinate God of the Jews, and endeavoured to overthrow the entire Old Tes tament revelation on the plea that it did not proceed from THE SAME SPIRIT  that animated the founders of the Christian Church.</p>
      <p> As Marcion and his followers took up such an antagonistic</p>
      <p> R</p>
      
      <p> attitude to the whole Old Testament, the entire body of Church teachers testified to the prophetic Spirit, and con fessed that one and the same Spirit spoke in both economies, — THE PROPHETS  by the Spirit foretelling the Messiah's advent, and  THE APOSTLES  by the same Spirit announcing the historic lact. The words which they put into the Church's mouth, and which we find repeated in the Constantinopolitan Creed, were : " The Spirit who spoke by the prophets." It is clear from the Patristic literature that has come down to us, that from the earliest times the Church had the doctrine of the Spirit in its substance and practical bearing, though the points were not fully thought out, and the terms of the later nomen clature were not as yet employed. The defects which we shall have occasion to trace came in afterwards, and were mainly due to the Greek philosophy and to the false adjust ments which were attempted in regard to it.</p>
      <p> We come next in order to the Christian apologists. Justin Martyr is an emphatic witness to the distinct personality of the Holy Spirit. Semisch, who devoted a life-long study to this writer, states that the title " prophetic Spirit" occurs twenty-seven times ; the title " Holy Spirit," thirty-two times ; " the holy prophetic Spirit," four times; " the Spirit of God," four times; "the divine Spirit," three times; "the prophetic Spirit of God," once ; " the divine holy prophetic Spirit," once. There is not so much said, nor so clearly said, of the third Person of the Trinity as of the second. But the Spirit's personality is clearly and emphatically stated. Thus he speaks of the explicit confession of the Trinity in connection with baptism, when he says that it was performed in the name of the Father of the universe and Lord God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost (1  Apol.  Ixi.). The same Trinitarian formula was used in the celebration of the Supper, the officiating minister offering up praise and glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and Holy Ghost (chap. Ixv.). In the same first  Apology  (A.D.  139)</p>
      
      <p> there are passages where Justin once and again denies the charge of Atheism, and names as the objects of Christian adoration, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I shall adduce two of these passages, because they are conclusive as to Justin's Trinitarianism: " What man of sound mind will not acknowledge that we are not Atheists, since we worship the Maker of this universe . . . and Him who was our teacher (TOP  SL&amp;da-tcdXov re)  in these things, Jesus Christ, Son of this true God—holding Him in the second place ; and the pro phetic Spirit  (Trvevfid re 7rpo&lt;f&gt;r)Tiic6v*)  we with reason honour " (chap. xiii.). The one God and the three objects of Chris tian worship cannot be more explicitly exhibited, connected together as they are by a Greek particle (re) which, as Hand 1  has proved, links together objects of co-ordinate rank with a certain dissimilarity peculiar to themselves. -</p>
      <p> The same thing may be traced in the well-known passage which has received so much discussion from Eomanists on the one hand and Unitarians on the other. But if we take along with us the passage which we have just adduced, little difficulty will be found either in its structure or its import. The passage is as follows: " Whence also we are called Atheists. And we confess that with regard to such reputed gods we are Atheists; but not with regard to the true God, the Father of justice, temperance, and the other virtues, with out any mixture of evil. But Him, and the Son (who came from Him and gave us instruction in these things, and con cerning the host of the other good angels following Him and made like to Him), and the prophetic Spirit  (•jrvevfj&gt;d re ro TrpofariKov),  we worship and adore, honouring them with reason and truth" (chap. vi.). That we have (1) the three Persons of the Godhead linked together by the Greek par ticles  (eKelvov re  KOI  rov viov rrvevpd re ro rrpo^rjriKov),  is evident at a glance to any true philologist. That we have (2) the well-known Greek expression of two accusatives after</p>
      <p> 1  See Hand's dissertation on  n.</p>
      
      <p> the verb " to teach," the one denoting the person taught, and the other the art and science in which he is instructed, can admit of little doubt  (8tBd^avra  ?5/xa5  ravTa  KOI  rov arparov}.  Scultetus, followed by Bishop Bull, was led by the true instinct of sound philology to see that this sense alone satisfies the import of the words and the demands of the connection; and they both pour out well-merited scorn on the Eomanists who wrested them, and still wrest them, from their scope to countenance the worship of angels, with a different degree of honour. This is to make a fourth object of worship, and to thrust it in between the Son and the Spirit. As I have already assigned the only admissible translation, I need not refer to the rendering which construes the words so as to intimate that Christ came teaching us and the host of other good angels. That is the rendering of Dr. Samuel Clarke, who puts it thus: " Who came forth from Him and taught these things to us, and to the whole host of good angels." It will in that case be a declaration that the angels as w r ell as we are instructed by our Lord. But that statement was by no means in Justin's scope or design.</p>
      <p> It has often been said that Justin confounds the Logos and the Holy Spirit. But a more critical inquiry into his words serves to prove only that these two divine Persons are in office closely connected, but not confounded. Justin certainly held that the Father, Son, and Spirit are from eternity, though he might not put his thoughts in the same definite form that was used in subsequent times, either to define the generation of the Son or the procession of the Spirit. But he was beyond all doubt a Trinitarian, though he might not clearly bring out that the economic Trinity presupposes the ontological Trinity.</p>
      <p> 1. The doxologies to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which were everywhere in use in the early Greek Church, furnish a conclusive proof of the acceptance of the doctrine of the Spirit, and of the prevalence of Trinitarian views.</p>
      
      <p> Thus, in the narrative of Polycarp's martyrdom, the truth of which, as given in the encyclical of the Church of Smyrna, and in nearly the same terms by Eusebius, is above suspicion, the martyr declares in his closing act of worship: " For this, and for all things, I praise Thee, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, with the eternal and heavenly Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, with  whom, to Thee and to the Holy Ghost, be glory both now and through all ages to come."    Basil, in his treatise on the Holy Spirit, states that "the glory to the Father  with the Holy Ghost"  was a familiar usage older than human memory, and that it was practised in the Church ever since the gospel was preached  (chap. xxix.).    That  a doxology to the Holy Ghost   implies  a belief  in   His   personality is  self-evident, because worship is never given to mere names or personifi cations.    And  we  may  regard   these   doxologies  as  taking their rise  in the most  natural  way,—as, in truth, nothing else but the inward and devout response of the worshipper to the baptismal formula.    The  Creed was  the response in the confession of the mouth, and the doxology was a similar response in the devotion of the heart.    Basil adduces another doxology of Africanus from the fifth book of his  Chronicon: "  We render thanks to Him who gave our Lord Jesus Christ to be a Saviour, to whom,  with the Holy Ghost,  be glory and majesty for ever."    Basil also  quotes to the same  purpose from  others—for  example, a passage  from  Clemens  which ascribes  life  to the  distinct  Persons of the Godhead (£?} 6 @eo9    KOI    o    icvpios    'J^croO?     Xpicrros,   Kal     TO     irvev^a    TO ayiov] ; and another passage  from the doxology  introduced into the Church of Neo-Csesarea by Gregory Thaumaturgus: " Glory to God the Father and Son,  with the Holy Ghost"  the import of which, as Gregory was careful to  set forth in the Confession of Faith preserved in the Church which he formed, was to confess a perfect Trinity in glory, eternity, and power, without separation or diversity of nature.    And in answer to Aetius, who would argue for a disparity in the Persons, Basil</p>
      
      <p> is at pains to prove that an equality of honour was intended by the terms, and a full belief that the Spirit possessed the same divine nature. Ity the use of these doxologies two things were intimated. The Persons were held to be distinct because they were distinctly worshipped, and all the three Persons to whom the glory is ascribed must have been regarded as participating in the same numerical divine essence.</p>
      <p> 2. The supernatural work of the Spirit in the inspiration of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament was never exhibited with greater clearness and force than by the early Fathers of the Greek Church. The impieties of Marcion and the Gnostics induced them to mature and formulate their views. They vindicated the apostles' authority and the plenary inspiration of the Spirit with a fulness of conviction and energy such as has rarely ever been evinced, and certainly never surpassed in any other quarter. The ordinary opera tions of the Spirit, as we shall see, have been much more correctly and fully displayed in other schools which were less under the spell of philosophic systems and sacramental grace. But nowhere has the miraculous gift of the Spirit in inspiring prophets and apostles been more amply displayed. Thus Justin Martyr, in speaking of the sacred writers as a stringed instrument, says: " Their task was but to surrender them selves wholly to the working of the Spirit of God, that the divine plectrum descending from heaven might make use of holy men as of a harp or lyre, in order to reveal to us the knowledge of divine and heavenly things." With not less point Irenseus says of the Scriptures: " They are spoken by the Word of God and His Spirit; while we in the degree in which we are inferior, and stand at the greatest distance from the Word of God and His Spirit, are in need of the knowledge of His mysteries." And again: " The Logos has given us a fourfold gospel which is held together by one Spirit."</p>
      
      <p> The quotations which have been collected from the Greek Fathers on the subject of inspiration by Lardner, Tollner, Eudelbach, and Westcott show how the early Church regarded the Scriptures as the Spirit's wonderful work. Thus Origen, speaking of the perfection of Scripture in connection with inspiration, says: " The sacred books are pervaded by the fulness of the Spirit. There is nothing either in the prophets, or in the law, or in the Gospels, or in the Epistles, which does not spring from the fulness of the divine majesty." The mode in which the Greek Fathers often in troduce a quotation by omitting the human writer and naming the Holy Spirit as the real author, is one of their most marked peculiarities: " As the Holy Ghost saith." The importance and value of all parts of the Scriptures, as the productions or words of the Holy Spirit, are constantly asserted. Thus, to mention Origen, we find him saying: " We can by no means say of the writings of the Holy Ghost that there is anything superfluous or idle in them, although many a thing may appear dark to many."</p>
      <p> 3. But the Greek writers, it must be admitted, labour under great defects. Of the ordinary operations of the Holy Spirit they have little to say. The remarks of Semisch embody a criticism which, however depreciatory it may seem to the literature of the Greek Church, cannot be regarded by any one who is largely conversant with that literature on the subject of the Spirit's inward operations as either prejudiced or unjust. " When treating of this subject," says Semisch, " they seem embarrassed and perplexed. They felt them selves obliged by the Biblical writings, and especially by the baptismal formula, to place the Spirit as a third object of devotion; but, in truth, they knew not how to bring this object into a living connection with their existing theology ; they were kept in constant vacillation on the question,  What position ought to be assigned to the Spirit  in His relations to the Father and Son—to the world—and especially to the</p>
      
      <p> work of redemption." A little farther on, Semisch says of Justin Martyr, to whom his remarks were meant more ex pressly to apply: " Of a continued operation of the Spirit on Christians he has nothing to say; he also regards the heathen-world as hermetically sealed against it."</p>
      <p> Some may regard that estimate as prejudiced and one-sided. But it is the testimony of a man whose judgment, from long and sustained inquiries, is entitled to great respect; and every one who knows the Greek Fathers will so far agree with him. A difference obtained between the Eastern and Western Church, as will afterwards more fully appear. The Greek apologists, with somewhat superficial views of sin, and spell bound by the Greek philosophy, from which they never fully emancipated themselves, extolled Christianity as the absolute reason, rather than God's remedy for guilt and sin. Thus Justin, who went from one philosophical school to another in order to ease a restless mind and pacify an aching heart, found what he sought in Christianity. But by him it was largely viewed as the adequate relief and resting-place of the soul, because it met his previous inquiries, and shed light upon problems which were previously inscrutable.</p>
      <p> To the Greek mind  SIN  was always too much an outward fact or a moral infirmity rather than an all-pervading reign of corruption and guilt for which an adequate remedy was to be provided. The Greek mind was satisfied with a too super ficial discovery of the doctrine of sin. And this goes far to explain why it is that they have so little to say upon the Spirit's continued operations on the individual Christian. The Greek literature, considered as an edifying and spiritual literature, is of immensely less value as to everything bearing on the Spirit's work than the writings of the school of Augustin, or of Anselm, or of Bernard, or of Luther, or of Calvin, or of the Puritans.</p>
      <p> The rise of  MOXTANISM  in Mysia between 157 and 171 forms the next fact in the history of opinion in reference to</p>
      
      <p> the Holy Spirit, and its refutation served a most important purpose in the Church. As the supernatural gifts conferred by apostles had but recently ceased, it was only what was to be expected in the course of things that some enthusiastic Christian of weak mind but fervent piety and zeal should appear to claim their restoration in his own person. Montanus was just such an one, a man of extravagant opinions and ascetic rigour, who lamented the prevalent laxity, and was carried headlong by Chiliastic sentiments. His way was prepared for him by the common belief based on what was deemed apostolic statements, that the Spirit of prophecy should not be with drawn from the Church till the Lord should come. Hence many were ready to listen to an enthusiast who should arrogate the function of a prophet. And the crude utter ances, ecstasies, and prophecies to which Montanus and his female associates, Maximilla and Priscilla, gave expression,— however offensive to sober minds,—found credit with many, and even with Tertullian. As to the Montanist views, I shall touch only those which bear on the work of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> While they held the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, their error consisted in maintaining that the Paraclete who ani mated the apostles was restored to Montanus; that it was necessary to recognise the spiritual gifts in Him ; and that  the Christian rule wliicli imposed a full restraint on the flesh,  and which could not be received even from the apostles, was now announced by Him as the instrument which the Comforter used for that purpose. He declared that for Christians mature manhood was now attained, as it had not been attained either under the law and prophets or under the gospel. These men held that all true Christians have the Holy Ghost, that the rights of such as possessed the spiritual gifts were paramount, and that all office in the Church must make way for their exercise.</p>
      <p> The discussions to which these views gave origin were im portant, and the refutation of their extravagant first principles</p>
      
      <p> lodged important truth in men's minds both as to the mode of divine revelation arid as to the finality of Scripture.</p>
      <p> As to the mode of a divine communication, we have frag ments preserved by Eusebius of a work written by Miltiades, which aimed to prove, against the Montanists, that a prophet could not speak in ecstasy, that is, without the calm posses sion of his mental powers. This fact implies that the Moutanist effusions must have been like similar effusions of later times—turbid, fanatical, and confused. Tertullian threw his shield over that excited mood of mind as not only necessary, but befitting in one who was overshadowed by the divine power. But in saying so, he spoke as the apologist of the system which he had embraced. The Church of whom Epiphanius may be taken as the representative expressed a wholly different view: " Let us," says he, " compare what is asserted by these parties with that which is undeniably contained alike in the Old and New Testaments, which is also seen and predicted in truth, and thereby test what is true prophecy and what is false. The true prophet spoke with the complete tranquillity of the mental powers, so that one thing followed another in a certain order; he spoke by the Holy Ghost, and therefore uttered everything with great confidence." We find similar sentiments expressed by Basil: " Some suppose," says he, " that the prophets prophesied in ecstasy, so that the human spirit was as it were overshadowed by the divine. But this is against the premiss of the divine inhabitation ; for how can the Spirit of wisdom and know ledge deprive any one of his senses ?"</p>
      <p> Another question was: Is the Church—since the canon of Scripture was closed—warranted to expect any further im mediate revelations or prophetic visions ? The ancient Church, as against the Moutanists, answered in the negative. It was a question, not what God can do, but whether He will, besides the written word, communicate any further revelations of the counsel of His will. And the discussion of this question</p>
      
      <p> with the Montanists anchored the Church in the conviction that it is rash and unwarrantable to expect any further dis closures from the Spirit of God, and that immediate revela tions are rather to be viewed as emanating from the adversary changed into an angel of light. To the allegation that the Church ought to enjoy extraordinary miraculous gifts, and that she has lost them by her own fault and through her own unbelief, the answer then given was that extraordinary gifts were never promised to the Church as a permanent inheritance, subsequently to the closing of the canon. And that style of argument has been confirmed by the unbroken experience of nearly two millenniums, attesting that they were withdrawn, and that they are not to be regarded as forfeited by her own fault.</p>
      <p> We turn to the discussions which assailed  THE DIVINE PERSONALITY  of the Holy Spirit. The truth on this point required to be vindicated against two phases of error, known as  SABELLIANISM  on the one hand, and  ARIANISM  or Mace-donianism on the other, which were in a certain respect antagonistieal to each other, and yet at one in their ultimate ground. There was a certain collision of mind between the two, but they occupied the attitude of producing or stimulat ing each other. And they agreed in regarding the divine Being as unipersonal, not Trinitarian.</p>
      <p> As to Sabellianism, the theory of modalism, or the Trinity of mere manifestation, it found its first utterance  (A.D.  200) in Praxeas of Asia Minor, who succeeded about the end of the second century in forming a party, and even in gaining over to his views Victor, Bishop of Home. This theory was accepted by Noetus of Smyrna, against whom we have the valuable homily of Hippolytus. It was accepted by Beryllus of Bostra, whom Origen reclaimed at a counsel held in  A.D. 244. Above all, it was resolutely maintained by Sabellius, presbyter of Ptolemais in the Libyan Peiitapolis, who from the year 218 became the head of the party, and who is described as the subtlest of the anti-Trinitarians.</p>
      
      <p> A certain obscurity envelopes the origin of Sabellianism, which long troubled the peace of the Church. It propounded the opinion that the terms Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were but different names of a unipersonal God. It was the first, or one of the first, errors on the Trinity  that got a footing within the Church}  and it is the error to which modern thought discovers a decided inclination to return. It was borrowed in a large measure from the Gnostics or Cerinthians, who not only denied a proper Trinity, but resolved all into appearance or manifestation. These forms of error were outside the Church. Sabellianism was the first anti-Trinitarian tendency that found access within the pale of the Church, and became the occasion of introducing a form of thought opposed to the most elementary truths of Christianity. Within the Church's pale, Sabellianism sprung from the desire to solve the mystery of the Trinity in unity by propounding the notion of a uni personal God variously manifested, or a mere modal distinc tion in the Godhead. During  THE THIRD CENTURY  it acquired a wide diffusion; and in many quarters it was boldly asserted. On this principle, of course, the Son and Spirit could have no part  in creation,  for they were not yet—there could be no atonement  on this principle, for there was no other person of the Trinity to whom it could be offered; and the Holy Spirit's power  was nothing but a vague, baseless influence that did not lean on a Mediator.</p>
      <p> When Praxeas introduced the opinion that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were but different names for one and the same Person, Tertullian, in a treatise that has come down to us, assailed it with the utmost vehemence, and so far influenced the person who originally taught the theory at Carthage, that for a time at least he was brought to a re cantation. The error soon broke out anew, and spread over the whole Libyan  Pentapolis,  the territory adjacent to Tripoli, to such an extent that, according to the statement 1  See Stillingfleet on the Trinity.</p>
      
      <p> of Athanasius, the Son of God was scarcely preached in the Churches of that district. Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, warned the leaders of that speculation to desist from propa gating such opinions, answered inquiries, and wrote letters to reclaim the Libyan bishops. And when they persisted in propagating their Unitarian opinions, he prepared a dogmatic treatise in which he brought out the personal distinctions of the Godhead, and the necessity of asserting them, though with such a want of due caution as laid him open to assault. Nor can all the vindication with which Basil and Athanasius have too generously shielded and defended him from those charges of Arianizing, which were made against his statements, exempt him from merited blame. He prepared an explanation in consequence of the remonstrances sent to him by Dionysius of Home, which restored him to the confidence of the Church, and to the reputation of orthodoxy. Sabellius was excom municated in  A.D.  261 ; an act of discipline that went far to check his opinions, and to bring back the Church to the two ideas of Trinity and unity.</p>
      <p> One fact presents itself to our notice in all these discus sions. Whenever an error arose on the subject of the Trinity in the Ante-Mcene Church, we find that the Fathers uniformly appeal to the baptismal formula. That was regarded as the secret of their strength; and it carried weight with ordinary Christians as well as theologians. Thus Tertullian, in his address against Praxeas, proves that Christ required His disciples to baptize into the Trinity and not into one of them (ad singula nomina in personas singulas tingimur).  There was no possibility of resisting the emphatic language of that sacramental formula, of which the express purport was that it must run distinctly in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Tertullian adduced, with not less force, an argument from the passages which refer to the mission of the Comforter, as affording the clearest proof of a Trinity in unity. It was against the Sabellians that the</p>
      
      <p> Church introduced the term  PERSON  in the ecclesiastical acceptation which it has ever since retained. Athanasius emphatically declared that he abhorred Sabellianism equally with Arianism. 1</p>
      <p> The special controversy, however, on the  DIVINE PERSON ALITY  of the Holy Spirit began with Arianism in the fourth century.  SABELLIANISM  and  ARIANISM  were more closely connected than at first sight appears. With an apparent antagonism, but an inner bond of connection, they acted on each other with a reciprocal influence, producing and being</p>
      <p> 1  Nothing strikes the inquirer more than the eager desire evinced by the modern Unitarians to appeal to the early Fathers negatively or positively. Fond as they are of declaring that they stand on the shoulders of the Fathers and Reformers, they find it necessary to consider this early testimony, however little it serves their cause. The attempt of Sand, the Arian, to make the early Fathers speak his sentiments, was exposed by "VVittichius in his  causa Spiritus sancti,  1678, and by Bishop Bull. The groundless statements of Curcellarus received merited chastisement from the hand of Stillingfleet. The more cautious appeal to the Fathers by Dr. Samuel Clarke was suiliciently met by Waterland, Hurrion, Abraham Taylor, and others. The bold statements of Priestley, on a subject where his information was far from extensive or correct, received the most overwhelming refutation from Velingius, Segaar, and Gavel in Holland, and from Bishop Horsley in this country. One of the effective treatises on the subject is Burton's testimonies of the Ante-Nicene Fathers to the doctrine of the Trinity  and of the divinity of the Holy Ghost, 1831. In the face of all this evidence, Dr. Lamson, a Unitarian writer of some reputation, in his work,  The Church of the Firxt Three Centuries  (Boston 1860), announces this as the conclusion to which he has come : " The modern doctrine of the Trinity is not found in any document or relic belonging to the Church of the first three centuries. Letters, art, usage, theology, worship, creed, hymn, chant, doxology, ascription, commemorative rite, and festive observance, so far as any remains, or any record of them is preserved coming down from early times, are, as regards this doc-trine, an absolute blank." Whether that repre sentation is ignorance or reckless misstatement I shall not take it upon me to decide—probably both. Baur's elaborate work, in three elaborate volumes, Die Chrislliche Lehrt ron der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in Hirer ijexchichtlichen Entwicklung,  is very far from being a reliable history of the doctrine, not because he intends to be unfair, but because he makes for the various writers a system which never had any existence except in his own brain. The three erudite volumes always remind me of what Schiller said playfully of himself, but which may be gravely said of Baur : " Ich werde immer eine Schlechte Quelle fur den Geschichtsforscher seyn, der Ungliick hat sich an mich zu wenden. Die Geschichte ist iiberhaupt ein Magazin fiir meine Phantasie und die Gegenstande miissen sich gefallen lassen was sie unter meinen Handen "Warden."</p>
      
      <p> produced. Arius, teaching presbyter of Alexandria, would solve the mystery in an opposite way from that which Praxeas and Sabellius had adopted. Living in the heart of the Sabellian district at Alexandria, Arius saw that the Sabellian theory was untenable; that it gave no explanation of the pre-existence and creative agency of the other Persons of the Godhead, and of their connection with the Old Testa ment generally  (A.D.  318).</p>
      <p> The Ptationalistic bias of Arius' mind appeared in this, that he would not allow distinct personality and co-ordinate rank to the three Persons named in the baptismal formula.    He would destroy the  Trinity in unity  ly   laying   stress on the subordination  of the second and third Persons,—which, so far as a certain order of action is concerned, the Church teachers never scrupled to admit,— and by denying their consubstanti-ality.     He  held the relation of  the   Son and   Spirit to be nothing more than a created relation, and   he thus showed that his mind was swayed and dominated, as Sabellius' was, by the theory of a unipersonal God.    He vehemently con tended that Deity and derivation from another person involved contradictory ideas.    The numerous arguments propounded by Arius, and especially by Eunomius,—who was by far the ablest of the  Arians, — as   these   are stated   and   referred   to   by Athanasius, Basil, and Gregory Nazianzen, may all be reduced to two—that the same  ETERNITY  and the same  INDEPENDENCE cannot possibly be possessed by a person who is  OF  or  FROM another.    There Arius paused, and resolutely adhered to the mere dictates of his own reason.    He maintained as the only warrantable explanation, that the Father originated the Son by the  fiat  of creation, and that the Holy Spirit was but the creature of a creature.    He dismissed in the most abrupt way the whole array of Biblical evidence, which goes to prove that the divine essence, numerically one, is possessed in common by Father, Son, and Spirit.</p>
      <p> It is stated, both by Epiphanius and Augustin, on evidence</p>
      
      <p> that seems liable to no suspicion, that   Arias regarded   the Holy Ghost as a creature of the Son, that is, as the creature of a creature ; because, according to his beliefs, the Son of God occupied no higher position than that of a creature.     It does not appear, however, that Arms at first openly assailed the Deity of the Spirit.    At least Alexander of Alexandria, in the letter which he sent to the bishops of the Christian Church expressly recording the erroneous views of Arius and of his followers, makes no mention of this point.    And the Nicene Creed,   directly   intended   to   refute    his   opinions,   contains nothing more on the Holy Spirit than the simple statement which had been confessed in the Church from the beginning: " I believe in the Holy Ghost."    If we compare the several statements that have come down to us, we may warrantably conclude  that, at  the   commencement  of   his   career, Arius, having no direct occasion to express his sentiments on the Holy Spirit, and being challenged ecclesiastically only for his avowed opinions on Christ's Deity, was content for a time to let the controversy be carried on in connection with the topics which gave rise to it; and that it was only at a later date, when pressed by arguments and demands that summoned him to declare himself explicitly and   without evasion, that   his error on the Holy Spirit, at least in its full extent, was at length   brought   to   light.      This   is   confirmed   by what  is recorded  in   connection   with   Athanasius'   disputation   with him.    During the sitting of the Council of Nice, Athanasius held a disputation with Arius, and in the course of that dis cussion  Arius declared  without concealment or evasion  his belief that  the  Holy  Spirit  was  but  a  creature.    We are further told that the proof which he adduced was the weakest that can be conceived, viz. that the Father sent the Paraclete from heaven, and that all things were made by Christ (John i. 3), leaving the inference to be deduced that He was among the creatures that Christ created.</p>
      <p> \Ve come to the remarkable period between the First and</p>
      
      <p> Second General Council  (A.D.  325-381), a period memorable for the great men who appeared in it, but equally memorable for the fundamental errors that agitated and distracted men's minds, and for the indecision, uncertainty, and unsettled opinion on the work and agency of the several Persons of the Godhead. After the divine Sonship of Christ had been asserted, the next fifty years may be described as a chaotic period, when men's minds were in many quarters perplexed and bewildered on the subject of the Holy Spirit's divine personality. It was only by slow and measured steps that the opinion of the Church on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit — under the guidance of her living Head — came to acquire consistency and calm rest. But she had to pass through a fiery trial.</p>
      <p> The principal assailants of the Deity of the Spirit were the Macedonians  (Trvev/jLarofia^oi),  called also Semi-Arians, be cause they denied the Deity of the Holy Ghost, even while they admitted the divine dignity of the Son. The founder of this sect was Macedonius, a man in no way venerable, who obtained the episcopal dignity by bloodshed, and who, after an unworthy occupancy of the post for a year, was ejected from it amid sedition and turmoil. It was after his deposi tion that he propounded his heresy, which consisted in denying the Spirit's Deity, and in proclaiming Him to be a mere creature, though it does not appear that he and his followers had arrived at any firm opinion as to the created nature, angelic or super-angelic, which ought to be ascribed to Him. The grounds on which the Macedonians assailed the Deity of the Holy Spirit were much the same with those which the Unitarians have urged in more recent times, but scarcely with the amount of ingenuity and plausibility which the latter have displayed.</p>
      <p> Before the Second General Council was assembled, the arguments of the Macedonians  (irvevfiaro^a^oi)  were fully confuted by Athanasius, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory</p>
      <p> s</p>
      
      <p> Xyssen. They drew out the proof for the Deity of the Holy Spirit, much in the same way as they had used in establish ing the supreme Deity of the Son, by texts ascribing  DIVINE</p>
      <p> DIGNITY,    OMNIPOTENCE,    OMNIPRESENCE,    and     OMNISCIENCE    to</p>
      <p> Him, and especially from  THE BAPTISMAL FORMULA,  because a creature could not be put into the formula as of co-ordinate rank with the Father and the Son. And Athanasius brings out that the Father works all  BY  the Son  IN  the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> In the strangely agitated period which preceded the calling of the Second General Council, the part which Basil acted was that of concession and of moderate demands. He was content if, in the eager efforts which were put forth to reclaim the Semi-Arians, they could be brought to declare that the Holy Spirit was not a creature, even though they did not take the positive ground of asserting His supreme Deity. To some, Basil's action has always, down from his own time to this day, seemed to argue the character of a trimmer; to others, it seems the part of a wise Church leader. His maxim was as follows : " Union will take place if we adapt ourselves to the weak, and do not provoke the minds of men. As many speak against the Holy Ghost, I request that you will reduce them as far as lies in your power to a small number.  They icho confess that the Holy Ghost is not a creature,  receive into your society, in order that the blasphemers alone may be left; and either reduce them to the truth by shame, or, if they remain in their sin, attach no more weight to the insignificant number. Let us require nothing further ; let us lay before them the Nicene Confession, and if they assent to it, let us ask them to call the Holy Ghost not a creature. He who confesses this, let him be received into the Church. I think we should require no more "  (Epist.  cxiii.).</p>
      <p> Some ecclesiastics to whom Basil's conduct was an enigma and a cause of anxiety made representations to Athanasius</p>
      
      <p> regarding it; and the letters in reply which have come down to us sufficiently attest that Athanasius entirely approved of the measures which Basil had taken. " I wonder," said Athanasius, "at the audacity of those who presume to reproach our beloved Bishop Basil, the true servant of God." " They may be assured," says he again, in writing to Palladius, " that he is the glory of the Church, a combatant for the truth, and a teacher of the needy; they must not fight against such a man." " He is, I am fully convinced, weak to the weak, that he may gain the weak."</p>
      <p> To show the state of that agitated transition period, a few facts may be added. Basil tells us that some held the Holy Spirit to be neither lord nor servant, but free  (eXevQepo?). Basil himself distinguishes the Spirit from the creature as follows: " The creature serves; but the Spirit makes free. The creature needs life; but the Spirit is the quickener. The creature needs instruction; but the Spirit is the teacher. The creature is sanctified ; but the Spirit is the sanctifier. Though you name angels, archangels, and all the super mundane powers, they have their holiness by the Spirit." Basil says: " The Holy Spirit is of God, not as all things are, but as  proceeding out sf God  (-jr/joeX^coj/)." And yet this eminent man, with not a few of the orthodox of that period, while fully believing in his own mind the supreme Deity of the Spirit, abstained for the sake of peace, and to avoid giving offence, from insisting on calling Him God</p>
      <p> Athanasius also, in his epistle to Serapiou, writing against the Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi, says in reference to those who make the Holy Spirit a creature : " Is it not madness, then, to say that the Spirit is a creature ? For if He were a creature, He would not have been ranked in the Trinity, the whole of which is our God." He, in the same epistle, strongly urges that the Holy Spirit is in God  (ev  ®ec3), and that a creature is outside the divine essence  (e^wdev  7779  rov 0eov overlap.  He lays out the whole strength and energy of his</p>
      
      <p> powerful mind to demonstrate how much the Spirit tran scends every predicate of creaturehood, calling Him " the sanctifying and illuminating life."</p>
      <p> During the continuance of that Semi-Ariaii or Macedonian controversy, which was as long as it was saddening and paralyzing, many were completely unsettled and at a loss what to hold. Thus Gregory Nazianzen states  (Or.  37) : " Some say that the Holy Spirit is a mere energy; others that He is a creature ; and others that He is God. And some will not affirm that He is any of these, out of reverence for the Scriptures, which, according to them, do not clearly indicate which of these He is. And they neither do Him honour nor dishonour, but are very much in the position of men who are indifferently affected toward Him. Some," he proceeds, " acknowledged that a ternary must be understood in our religion, but they so widely distinguished the Persons from each other as to make one of them infinite in substance and in power ; the other infinite in power, not in substance ; and the third circumscribed in both."</p>
      <p> For such a condition of things the definitions of the Council of Constantinople in  A.D.  381 offered a mental relief and satisfaction that could not be expressed. The weary and agitated mind of Christendom—on which such distracting controversies had been let loose—welcomed the repose. The decision given by that Council—arid which at once entered into the universal creed of Christendom—was singularly calm and measured. It was appended as a mere addition to the Nicene Creed, neither inserting the term HOMOOUSIAN nor the words  VERY GOD OF VERY GOD,  which had been already applied to the Son, and leaving it to be inferred that they were equally applicable to the Holy Spirit. The addition made to the Nicene Creed on the Holy Ghost was simply the words: "  THE LORD AND GIVER OF LIFE, WHO PROCEEDETH FROM THE FATHER,  \viio,  WITH THE FATHER AND SON TOGETHER,</p>
      <p> IS WORSHIPPED AND GLORIFIED, WHO SPAKE BY THE PROPHETS."</p>
      
      <p> The whole tenor of that invaluable addition to the Nicene Creed furnishes a clear though indirect proof that the Mace donian error, against which it was meant to be directed, denied the supreme Deity of the Holy Spirit. It does not appear what sort of created nature was ascribed to the Spirit by that heresiarch. But the refutation, which is contained in the simple enumeration of these positive predicates, is the most complete that could have been devised. Some, indeed, from an inadequate apprehension of its scope and aim, have expressed surprise that in a creed expressly prepared against a heresy that represented the Holy Spirit as a creature, the framers of the article did not in so many words designate Him God. Others, putting a construction upon the tenor of the article from what they know of Basil's mode of action, have conjectured that the assembled Fathers abstained from the use of the term  GOD  as applied to the Spirit, in order to avoid offence, because the heretics could not endure the application of the term God to the Spirit. Petavius appeals to Gregory Nazianzen's confession as regards his friend Basil. There is no foundation for such a sinister view. Basil had died two years before; and the bishops assembled at Constantinople exercised—as the transactions of the council prove—an independent judgment in this matter. They prepared the Confession on the article of the Holy Spirit in terms directly antagonistic to Macedonius' error and completely subversive of his opinions. A few words will suffice to show this.</p>
      <p> 1. Macedonius held that the Holy Spirit as a creature derived His life from Christ; and he based his argument on a false interpretation of the w r ords in the preface of John's Gospel (John i. 3). We are told by Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Theophylact, and others, that Macedonius, in order to prove that the Holy Spirit received His life, like any other creature, from Christ, punctuated the two verses in an incorrect way, thus : "  All  things were made by Him, and without Him was</p>
      
      <p> not anything made. That which was made in Him was life." To obviate that misinterpretation, the framers of the Creed inserted the terms: " the Lord and Giver of life "  (TO  Kvpiov TO  £Voo7roi6V), intimating that He is Himself the source of life, and that it is He who imparts it in all its forms to others who stand related to Him as His creatures.</p>
      <p> 2.   The Macedonians argued that if the Holy Spirit were true God, He must either be begotten or tinbegotten; and as neither predicate is given to Him in Scripture, He must be held to be a creature.    Against this argument the framers of the article inserted from Scripture the words:  who procecddh from  the Father   (TO    e'/c   TOV    rraTpos   eKTropevofjLevov].      Their</p>
      <p> intention was to show that the Holy Spirit might be true God without being either begotten or unbegotten, and that this was the peculiar style, according to Christ's own delineation, by which we are to mould our language in speaking of the personal subsistence of the Spirit, and through which we are to think our thoughts regarding Him.</p>
      <p> 3.   The Macedonians, the assailants of the Spirit's Deity, commonly appealed, moreover, to an alleged fact, but which in reality had no foundation, viz. that the Scripture nowhere commands us  to  adore and worship the  Holy Spirit.    This was one  of their chief arguments, as it has been the main argument of the Unitarians of subsequent times.    And the Fathers of Constantinople expressly avowed the opposite in the words which they inserted : " Who, with the Father and the Son together, is worshipped and glorified "  (TO  av^rrpoa-Kwov-pevov Kal crvv&amp;o^a^o/jievov).</p>
      <p> 4.   The   last thing inserted was a point which, from  the earliest times, the Christian Church had always adduced as a proof of the supreme Deity of the   Spirit,  and  which was confessed  in   the  first   creeds, viz.  that  He  spoke   by the Old  Testament prophets    (TO    \a\ija-av   8ia   TWV   TT/DO^TWI/). This was the last clause of the article inserted in the Con-stantinopolitan Creed.</p>
      
      <p> Before proceeding with our historical sketch, t\vo questions presented by the critical inquirer demand an answer.</p>
      <p> It is asked: Why did not the First Council,  THE NICENE COUNCIL,  anticipate or preclude much of the painful dubiety which agitated men's minds during the interval between the two councils, by pronouncing in terms much more definite and express on the supreme Deity of the Holy Spirit ? The reason was, that they could not fitly condemn an undeveloped error, which Arius, indeed, cherished in his heart at the time of the Council of Nice (for he regarded Him as a creature), but which had not been so publicly avowed as to become the subject of ecclesiastical action. Though the subsequent attack on the Spirit was but the natural and necessary con sequence of the opinions which he entertained, the Fathers at Nice could neither speak of it as an actually existing error, nor act against it when it was but a possible heresy. As to their own belief in the Deity of the Spirit, that is evident enough from the three clauses of the Nicene Creed which relate to the Trinity.</p>
      <p> A second question which has a plausible appearance, when taken in connection with the subsequent history, is: Why did the Fathers of the Second Council, the  CONSTANTINOPOLITAN COUNCIL,  declare the doctrine of the Spirit's procession in so defective a manner, merely saying : " who proceedeth from the Father"? The reason was, that the Semi-Arians or Macedonians, against whom the Council pronounced, main tained an error which rendered it necessary to use language which should neutralise and obviate that error, and which was of a nature entirely different from those subsequent debates on the procession of the Spirit which were carried on between the Oriental and Western Churches several centuries afterwards. With the Fathers at Constantinople the one question was, whether the Holy Spirit was supreme God or a creature. It was not the later question, whether the Holy Spirit,  CONFESSEDLY A DIVINE PERSON,  proceeded from</p>
      
      <p> the Father, or from the Father and the Son  (jilioque).  If the Fathers at Constantinople would set forth sound orthodox doctrine in contrast with the new heresy, and so far only as the new heresy assailed it, it was necessary for them to affirm that He  WAS GOD BECAUSE HE PROCEEDED FROM GOD,  and received His essence from the Father by procession. This was what the Creed declared, viz. that He proceedeth from the Father, and was therefore true God, because by pro cession partaker of the Father's essence. On the contrary, the Macedonians or Semi-Arians had changed their ground. They had, as Arians, in the first step denied that the Son was cousubstantial with the Father. Afterwards they held that all beyond the circle of the Father and the Son  WAS A CREATURE OF THE SON,  and consequently that the Holy Ghost was created by the Son. The Semi-Arians were thus obliged, according to their principles, to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds immediately from the Father. That would involve His Deity and participation in the divine essence ; and hence the Fathers of the Constantinopolitan Council felt it necessary to assert, and accordingly did assert, the opposite in the simple use of Christ's own words, which were held to be conclusive of the whole question:  u-Jw proceedeth from the Father  (John xv. 26).</p>
      <p> But none of the great men who at that age adorned the Greek Church entertained any doubt that the Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but from the Son. I do not anticipate the history of this discussion which agitated the Eastern and "Western Church at a later day. But in con nection with the peculiar expression of the Constantinopolitan Creed, " who proceedeth from the Father," it is only fitting and appropriate to remark—what all students of this remark able period will admit—that the peculiar phrase employed in the Constantinopolitan Creed, enlarged at a later day by the addition of the  filioquc  to meet the views of the West, and resolutely retained in its original form in the East,—when</p>
      
      <p> viewed in its true significance before that angry controversy began,—was so expressed in order to meet the Semi-Arians, who wished to reduce the Spirit to the rank of a mere creature.</p>
      <p> HISTORIC SURVEY OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE PROCESSION OF THE SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> This expression means, according to the opinion of the Greek and Latin Fathers who employ it, that the Spirit receives His essence and personality from Him from whom He proceeds (John xv. 26), just as the Son is said to receive His personality from the Father by whom He is begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, and on this account is called the Only-begotten of the Father; whereas the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of His Son (Gal. iv. 6), is warrantably held to have His essence and personality from both. Though it is nowhere expressly said in the Scripture that the Spirit proceeds from the Son, yet no one who submits his mind to the evidence supplied by many passages can doubt that the thought is diffused through the entire Biblical testimony on the subject. But as to  THE HISTORY  of the doctrine, we may affirm that there are three epochs, which may be identified with the three names of  ATHANASIUS, THEODORET,  and  PHOTIUS,  in Greek theology on the question before us.</p>
      <p> In the  FIRST EPOCH,  that is, from the rise of Greek theology till the time of Epiphanius (t 403), the received opinion, shared equally by the writers of the East and West, was that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>
      <p> Didymus, a monk of Alexandria, blind, but a man of ex traordinary learning, composed a work in three books on the Holy Spirit, translated into Latin by Jerome, in which he writes: " Christ said of the Comforter, ' He will not speak of Himself, but shall receive of mine,'—that is, because He is</p>
      
      <p> not of Himself, but of the Father and me,—for  His personality (hoc enim quod subsistit)  He has from the Father and me " (Book II.). Epiphanius explicitly says: " If Christ is be lieved to be from the Father, God of God, so the Spirit is believed to be from Christ, or from them both"  (TO  Be Trvevpa ayiov Trapa afiforepoov') (Anc.  § 70, 71). Gregory Xyssen and Basil in like manner use the same language in various passages, as has been repeatedly proved by those who know their works, and who have always been profoundly struck by the fact that  the Greek Church never had any scruple in her best days,  and when she had her greatest divines in the fourth century,  in speaking of the procession of the Spirit from the Son  as well as from the Father. Athanasius says that " the Holy Spirit has the same order and nature in relation to the Son that the Son has to the Father" (ad Sera2).  § 21); "along with the Father, the Son is the fountain of the Holy Ghost"  (Ari.  § 9). These quotations, which might be indefinitely multiplied, leave no room to question the theological opinion of that first epoch in the Greek Church. Before we pass from this epoch we may adduce the words of Augustin as a witness in the Western Church to the same effect in those remarkable elucidations of the Gospel of John, which he has supplied in a series of 124 tractatus.  In the 99th Exposition, taking up the procession of the Spirit with his usual profoundness, he declares again and again that it is both from the Father and Son; and he lays down a position which Anselm several centuries afterwards handled with consummate power, both in his oral discussion with the Greeks and in his treatise on the procession. Augustin asks: " If, then, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, why did the Son say: He proceedeth from the Father?" To that question he replies: "A quo autem habet Filius ut sit Deus (est enim de Deo Deus)  ab illo halct utiqiie  ut etiam de illo procedat Spiritus Sanctus: ac per hoc Spiritus Sanctus ut etiam de Filio procedat sicut</p>
      
      <p> procedit de Patre, ab ipso habet Patre." Not only so : when Christ says, " who proceedeth from the Father," it must be borne in mind that, according to the uniform tenor of Christ's teaching, He refers all to the Father because He Himself, as the only-begotten Son, is of the Father, and thus He has it from the Father that the Spirit proceeds from Him, the Son.</p>
      <p> The  SECOND EPOCH  in Greek theology, in which we find voices raised for the procession  FROM THE FATHER ONLY,  begins with the Council of Ephesus in  A.D.  431. Theodore, in the creed drawn up by him, to which attention was directed by that Council, declared that the Holy Spirit did not receive His subsistence through the Son  (ov&amp;e Bi vlov vTrdpgtv 64X17^)09). Theodore qualified many things, and was per mitted to close his career in the Church notwithstanding all the crude and divergent views to which he had given utter ance. Not long afterwards, when Cyrill launched his anathe-matisms against Nestorius, he revived the subject by saying: " If any one shall not confess that the Spirit by whom He wrought miracles was His own, let him be anathema." To that Theodoret, the attached friend of Nestorius, replied in a defiant attitude: " That the Spirit is the Son's own Spirit we shall confess and accept as a pious utterance, if he meant of the same nature and proceeding from the Father; but if he meant that He has His subsistence from the Son or by the Son (o&gt;5 e'£  vlov, rj  BL  vlov rrjv inrdp^iv e^ov},  we repudiate it as blasphemous and impious" (Theod. on Cyrill's Anathe-matisms). Though it is confessedly difficult to trace or conjecture the purpose which prompted that resolute attitude of  THEODORET,  he was the first who openly avowed that the Holy Spirit is not of the Son, nor by the Son, but from the Father only. The opinion was not at that time generally accepted or approved in Greek theology. Men were for a long time left to a free judgment upon the question. Opinion was in process of being decidedly formed in the West, under</p>
      
      <p> the influence of  Augustin,  in favour of the procession from the Son as well as from the Father.</p>
      <p> "We come to the controversy on the  filioquc,  that is, the addition from the Father  and the Son,  which after centuries of polemical discussion ended in the permanent disruption of the Greek and Latin Church. The Western Church, in accordance with the views of Augustin, laid emphasis on the procession from the Father and the Son, and naturally wished to elevate the doctrine to confessional authority in the Creed. But how was that to be done ? Instead of effecting it by a Council of the whole Church, the only competent way, and by a common understanding, it was introduced into the Xicreno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the arbitrary and un authorized addition of the  filioque  at the Council of Toledo, A.D.  589, under King  Reccaredus,  who had abandoned Arianism from an enlightened preference for the orthodox faith. From that time the third article of the Creed was always read and chanted in Spain, France, and Germany with this addition. When the Greeks became  acquainted with this fact, they not unnaturally charged the Latins with the falsification of the Creed, and with an unwarrantable addition without the concurrence of the entire Christian Church. The Western Church had the truth, but their mode of action was unwarrantable. Instead of interpolating the Creed,—which was the less unwarrantable from the fact that the clause so altered was expressed in the very words of Scripture,—their proper course was to have taken another part of Scripture which ascribes the procession to the Son as well as to the Father. Had they, for example, inserted such a clause as this: " Who is the Spirit of the Son as well as of the Father," and had an Ecumenical Council inserted it, they might possibly have forestalled the schism, or at least have removed the occasion. As it was, the action of the Latins cannot be vindicated. For, though the doctrine that the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Son as well as from</p>
      
      <p> the Father is undoubtedly well-founded, the Latins, instead of presuming to interpolate the Creed of the entire Church, should have recollected that the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed was everywhere accepted; that not a word could warrantably be altered without the general concurrence of the entire Church; and that such an arbitrary enlargement must be offensive to their Oriental brethren. The addition first made in Spain was generally received in the West, in France, Italy, and England. Leo III., however, who was raised to the Papal dignity  A.D.  795-816, when appealed to for per mission to insert the  filioqiie  in the repetition of the Creed, firmly refused, from the earnest desire which he always enter tained to be in friendly relations with the Greek Church. To show how firm his purpose was,—a purpose from which he was not to be moved even by Charlemagne, who defended the filioqiie, —Leo caused the unaltered Creed to be engraved on a silver plate for the Church of St. Peter in Borne. But the addition had been made, and was not to be undone. The Churches in Spain, France, and elsewhere sung the Creed with this addition. What Pontiff was prevailed upon to permit the addition is not certain; for different writers have given different names. Petavius says correctly that it is not known by whom the concession was made. Nor did the preparation of the Athanasian Creed, as it was un warrantably called, improve the matter. The opposite senti ment was diffused by it throughout all the East.</p>
      <p> The controversy soon became  A DOGMATIC ONE.  The Greeks now actually began, as a body, to deny the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son. And the acrimony as well as disingenuous artifices which speedily ensued from heated minds, the assumptions on the one side, and the violent antagonism on the other, form a sad chapter of ecclesiastical history. Not a few of the Greek writers, though they con stantly rejected the phrase " procession from the Father  AND the Son," yet acknowledged " a procession from the Father</p>
      
      <p> THROUGH  the Son;" and they explained it sometimes in one way and sometimes in another way. But for the most part they would not admit that anything more was indicated</p>
      <p> than AN ECONOMICAL RELATION or THE IDEA OF MISSION.      TllUS</p>
      <p> John Damascen puts the matter in the following way: " We believe in one Holy Spirit in all things like the Father and the Son—proceeding from the Father and  dispensed ~by  the Son"  (Ortli. F.  c. 10).</p>
      <p> What may be called  THE THIRD EPOCH  in Greek theology, took its rise with  FHOTIUS,  who wrote on the procession according to the current view of the Greek Church, and con demned as blasphemous the opinion entertained in the West (A.D.  867). He brought together all the arguments which could be adduced for his side of the question. But they are inferential, presumptuous, and little better than vain logic applied to a theme beyond the scope and application of mere logical deduction. This so offended the Latin Church, that the addition to the Creed, hitherto used only in Spain, France, and Germany, was now openly accepted everywhere. The division inevitably assumed the form of a schism about the year 1054. But a new necessity arose, of a national kind. Though there had always been individuals among the Greeks who had concurred in sentiment with the Western theology on the doctrine of the procession, a new element came into operation. The Greeks were harassed by the Turks on every side; and as it began to be apparent that the Eastern Empire could not for a long time support itself against these powerful and constantly advancing enemies without help from the West, they made eager and repeated requests for help. They sent ambassadors to the Council of Constance (1414-1418), and also to the Council of Basil (1431-1449), but they effected nothing. Only on one condition could help be accorded— that the Greeks should be reunited to the Western Church. To bring this about, every effort was used—from the effect of fear on the one side, and ambition on the other. At length</p>
      
      <p> Engenius IV. called a council at a time when the Turks threatened to accomplish the overthrow of the Eastern Empire. To this council, known as the Council of Florence, which first met at Ferrara at the end of 1438, and was transferred to Florence in 1439, the Greek Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople anxiously repaired, in the vain hope of receiv ing help from the West. But they were required to accept the Western view of the procession, together with some points of Eomish doctrine to which it is not necessary here more particularly to refer. These conditions were accepted under the pressure of necessity, when it was too late. But it may be useful to refer to the formula or article of union, as it serves to show the true position of the whole question which was disputed between the Churches. This formula, drawn up by Scholarius, afterwards called Gennadius, was as follows: " Since we Greeks hitherto supposed that the Latins affirmed that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles or by two spirations,  and did not affirm that  the Father is the fountain of Deity, viz. of the Son and Holy Spirit,  we with much aversion withdrew both from the addition made by the Latins to the Creed, and from their communion. But now, being by the singular grace of God assembled in this sacred and ecumenic synod in order to cement a sacred union between us, after many questions ventilated on both sides, after keen discussions and the adduc ing of many testimonies both from sacred Scripture and from the Church-teachers,  we Latins  declare and profess that in our affirmation respecting the Spirit's procession from the Father and the Son we  do not express it in the sense of excluding the Father from being the fountain and origin of the whole, Deity — that is, of the Son and Holy Spirit,  or as if we believed that the Son received,not from the Father that procession of the Spirit from the Sou, or as if we held two principles or two spirations of the Holy Spirit; but we firmly believe and pro fess that the Holy Spirit from eternity proceeded from the</p>
