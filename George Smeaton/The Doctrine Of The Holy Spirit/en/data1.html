      <p> "  The love of God is shed abroad upon our hearts by the Holy Ghost ivhich is given to us"  (Eom. v. 5). These words intimate that the Holy Ghost as a divine agent does a certain work; that He is given according to a divine economy; and that through His aid the redeeming love in God's heart is shed abroad in our hearts, tasted and enjoyed, not only in the first stages of the Christian's experience, but ever afterwards. Plainly this is distinct from miraculous gifts and from the proclamation of the gospel. It intimates that the Holy Ghost sheds abroad God's boundless, free, unchanging love in our hearts, and that He is given to believers as a perpetually indwelling guest,—reminding the Christian of reconciliation, supplying the constant experience of the divine love, and assuring him of its perpetuity as a gift never to be forfeited.</p>
      <p> It is in the eighth chapter, however, that we find the doctrine of the Holy Spirit most fully developed, from different points of view. The apostle's object is to prove the certainty of the believer's salvation from the fact that they are led by the Spirit of God. He demonstrates that they enjoy the effectual operation of the Spirit as a blessing which has its ground in the surety-obedience of Christ its procuring cause (2-4). The argument is, that they who are occupied by the Spirit and who walk after the Spirit are exempt from condemnation. In other words, he argues that they who are free from the service of sin through the Spirit of life are by that fact proved also to be free from condemnation. The apostle had set in a clear light the connection between justification and sanctification on the ground of merit or purchase (vi. 1-13). He here shows that the spiritual life is secured by the effectual operation of the Holy Spirit. The entire section exhibits the Christian in the highest stages of the divine life, and supplies a rule by which the Christian teacher is to regulate his thinking and phraseology.</p>
      <p> The apostle begins his discussion on the Spirit with these memorable words: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death" (Eom. viii. 2). The two laws — that of sin and death, already referred to in the seventh chapter (vii. 23), and a counterpart law of life in Christ—are again put in direct antithesis—that is, into the contrast of flesh and spirit, which \ve find pervading the whole Pauline theology. But why, it may be asked, is the Spirit called the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus ? The entire expression is equivalent to this : the spirit of life residing in Christ and dispensed by Christ is a law of irresistible power counteracting the law of sin and death. It is the law written on the heart, by which the regenerate man is step by step enabled to resist sin and follow holiness. It is the law of the life-giving Spirit in the fellowship of Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p> The apostle next adverts to several operations of the Spirit which deserve the most attentive consideration singly and collectively.</p>
      <p> 1.   The first thing to be noticed is the sequence of operations as described in the Christian's experience.    There are three distinct expressions, which are introduced in this order: (1) They walk after the Spirit (viii. 4); (2) they are spiritually-minded (viii. 6);  (3) they are in the Spirit (viii. 9).    In the order of sequence the  last named, however, comes first, as follows:—They are  in the Siririt  by the act of regenerating grace;   they are  spiritually-minded —that is, they mind the things of the Spirit when they are inwardly disposed, moved, and   animated  according  to  the  mind of  the  Spirit;   they walk after  the   Spirit,   which  refers more to their outward practical life.     The sequence is such as proves that it is not sufficient to perform good works which challenge the attention of spectators, unless there be the inner change of character and disposition, which  naturally weans the  heart from the objects to which the natural bias disposes it.</p>
      <p> 2.   The second thing mentioned in the passage is, that the Spirit  DWELLS  in the Christian (viii. 9).    A running contrast between the flesh and Spirit is carried out through the entire section.    And the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ is adduced as a conclusive proof that we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; for Christ, the second Adam, received the Spirit as a reward for the performance of His work of suretyship, that He might impart the Spirit to all believers. When the apostle subjoins : " if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of His " (ver. 9), it shows that the participation of the Holy Spirit is not universal; and that only they who are given to Christ and redeemed by Him, enjoy the inhabitation of the Spirit in the Biblical acceptation of the term. In them He dwells, as in His habitation or abode, for ever. It is this inhabitation which imparts the spiritual mind, the mark by which the true disciple is distinguished; for Christ and His people are anointed with the same Spirit.</p>
      <p> 3.   The   Spirit is    LIFE    because of  righteousness (v.  10). Though the body is dead because of sin, this death is not re garded as a punishment or anything properly penal, but only as a consequence, still permitted to run its course, after Christ has fully satisfied divine justice.    But the Spirit is life on the ground  of Christ's  righteousness.     As   He  gave  life to  all creatures at first, so does He give life immortal, incorruptible, and unfading to the new creature—that is, to all the redeemed of the Lord.</p>
      <p> 4.   They who have the  Spirit mortify the  deeds  of the body (ver. 13).    They are debtors, not to the flesh, but to the Spirit.    The flesh, or the deeds of the body, they mortify, because they are the cause of death.    They cannot so kill it that it shall stir no more; but they, by the Spirit, weaken it, and lop off its branches one by one.</p>
      <p> 5.   They are led by the Spirit of God, and are thus evinced to be the children of God (ver. 14).    The expression: "led by the Spirit," refers to an inward prompting, impulse, and inclination, which so rules and guides them that they cannot omit duty or neglect privilege.    It implies the helplessness of a child which cannot stand alone, but needs a strong sup porting hand; for it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps (Jer. x. 23).    The saints of God, to whom the expres sion applies, are not only ignorant of the way, but when they know it, their liability to stumble too readily betrays itself, and their natural reluctance must constantly be overcome. This  LEADING  is attributed to the Spirit of God, the master of the inclinations, of the will and the affections by which men are moved and animated, so that in due time they desire to do nothing but what they are prompted to undertake by the illumination from on high.</p>
      <p> They are on this ground evinced to be the  CHILDREN OF GOD  ; and this leads the apostle to describe the Holy Spirit as the author of adoption, and as prompting the believer to realize the privileges connected with the filial relationship. Philippi seems to me mistaken l   in denying that the phrase SPIRIT OF ADOPTION  can mean the Spirit who effects the Son-ship or transplants us into the relationship of sons. The analogy of all the phrases of this description—such as the Spirit of love, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of power, the Spirit of revelation, and the like — implies that He is the producing cause of the term following in the genitive. This is no exception to the uniform usage. The same Spirit pro duces the bondage to fear, and effects the adoption. On this great central blessing put in our possession by the Spirit, I shall not now enlarge, as it afterwards engages our attention in the dogmatic part of this treatise.</p>
      <p> The other effects of the Spirit mentioned in this chapter are these: Christians have the first-fruits of the Spirit, and the Spirit helps them in prayer.</p>
      <p> 6. With regard to the first-fruits, the apostle says: "We ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit" (ver. 23). Speaking of the groaning universe waiting for deliver ance, he adds, that Christians also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit groan. Some, with Grotius, incorrectly limit these terms to the apostles. James, indeed, speaks of the early Christians as the first-fruits (Jas. i. 18). But the Apostle</p>
      <p> 1  He snys, incorrectly: "Das Tv^a  vietiflaf  kann nun nicht sein cler Geist \velcher die Kindscliaft wirkt" (Kom. viii. 15).</p>
      
      <p> Paul is not speaking  OF PERSONS,  but  OF GIFTS  ; and there is only one tolerable interpretation—viz. that which refers the first-fruits to the commencement of the communications of the Spirit which are enjoyed in this life.</p>
      <p> 7. The other benefit is the Spirit's help in prayer (ver. 26). When Christians know not what to ask, the Spirit helps their infirmities, interceding  IN THEM  with unutterable groanings, while Christ intercedes  FOR THEM.</p>
      <p> The only other passage which I shall adduce from this Epistle is the prayer of Paul, that the Roman Christians might be filled with faith and hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. He ascribes both the origin and growth of these graces to the Holy Spirit (xv. 13).</p>
      <p> The Epistle to the  EPHESIANS,  amid the deep truths opened up to a congregation which was specially prepared to take them in, interweaves the doctrine of the Spirit in a way which makes the train of the argument in the highest degree practical.</p>
      <p> The economy in virtue of which the Holy Spirit is dis pensed is thus exhibited in the prayer for the congregation: " Making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation  in the knowledge of Him " (Eph. i. 17). He asks the Spirit on their behalf from the God of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, the dis penser of the Spirit, on the ground of Christ's merits as the procuring cause. The import of the words: " The Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus," comprehends a full discovery of what was planned and effected by God in the work of man's redemption. We have here a numerous and varied class of blessings of which the Holy Ghost is the producing cause. It is what philologists call the genitive of the author.</p>
      <p> " The Spirit of revelation in the knowledge of Christ" is a memorable title of the Spirit from the work which He performs upon the human mind (Eph. i. 17), in illuminating the eyes of the heart, as it is here expressed, to behold a beauty in divine things of which it had previously no conception. Notwithstanding the lingering remains of the image of God in reason, conscience, and the longing after immortality, there was not before this one spark from which the illumina tion of the understanding could arise—only darkness and enmity (1 Cor. ii. 14; Rom. viii. 7). The Spirit enlightens the understanding, which was previously alienated from the life of God (Eph. iv. 18), to perceive the truth of the gospel, as worthy of God and divinely adapted to human wants, and especially the truth relating to Christ's atonement. Not that the natural man could not with sufficient correctness grasp the thought in a speculative way; but it was much in the same way in which a blind-born man thinks or speaks of colours. "When the eyes of the heart are opened, a glory is beheld in Christ's person and work unknown before; and a light is conveyed to the mind which produces a transforming change on all its powers.</p>
      <p> Another passage in this Epistle not less emphatic is: "  Through Him  (Christ)  we loth have access by  [in]  one Spirit unto the Father"  (Eph. ii. 17). The apostle, speaking in the person of the Church composed of Jews and Gentiles, says : " We BOTH have access, or introduction, to the Father," and he mentions the mediator through whose merits that intro duction is effected. He adds that it is  IN ONE SPIRIT,  whom w 7 e possess as a Spirit of faith and love, infusing confidence on the ground of Christ's priesthood. The  one Spirit  can only mean the one Holy Ghost, which men of all nationali ties, without distinction, now enjoy; and the force of the preposition: "  IN  one Spirit," is by no means to be stripped of its significance, as has too often been done by commen tators. The intention of the apostle was to bring out with precision the difference of the relation in which Christ and the Spirit stand to the Church,—the one as the meritorious</p>
      
      <p> Surety, the other as the life-giving  agent who puts us in possession of the whole redemption.</p>
      <p> In the use of a favourite expression, the apostle again calls the Spirit a  SEAL  and  EAKNEST.  " After that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance " (i. 13). To the same effect the apostle warns them not to grieve the Holy Spirit by whom they were sealed (iv. 30). As to the order in which this sealing stands, it conies after believing—that is, next after faith; and as to the  SEAL  itself, too much ingenuity has often been used in elucidating it. Without appealing to classical or Hebrew examples, it may suffice to say that the impress of a seal implies a relation to the owner of the seal, and is a sure token of belonging to him. From the three passages where the term  SEAL  is expressly used, we gather that believers are God's inviolable property, and known to be so by the Spirit dwelling in them. The sealing implies that the image engraven on the seal is impressed on the thing, or on the person sealed. In this case it is the image of God im pressed on the heart by the enlightening, regenerating, and sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit. By that seal believers are declared to be the inviolable property of God (2 Tim. ii. 19); and they are sealed to the day of redemption as some thing which is to be inviolably secure (Eph. iv. 30). Not only so: there is a subjective assurance which they acquire as to their gracious state and final glory. The Spirit is also called an  EARNEST  (appaftwv)  as well as a seal—that is, a foretaste which is equivalent to the first-fruits of the Spirit, elsewhere mentioned (Eph. iv. 14).</p>
      <p> The apostle prays in a second memorable prayer for the Ephesians, that they might be  strengthened with might  BY  THE SPIRIT  in the inner man, that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith (iii. 16). The Spirit strengthens the believer by giving him a share in all the benefits and blessings which Christ procured, as well as by confirming faith and love, that the conscious indwelling of Christ may be realized; the in dwelling of Christ answering to the confirmation of the Spirit. When the apostle refers to the Church, he calls it an habitation of God in the Spirit (Eph. ii. 22), and, by another figure, one body and one Spirit (iv. 4). Nor does he stop at doctrine: while enforcing Christian duty, he introduces the Holy Spirit in many connections. When he warns the Ephesians against indulging angry passions and unworthy practices, he says: " Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God," implying that such things on the part of Christians grieve the Spirit 1  (iv. 30). When he exhorts them to prayer, he bids them pray with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit (vi. 18). When he warns them against intemperance, he immediately subjoins an exhortation, calculated in its exercise to exclude all tendency to the habit of intemperance by the spiritual joy and satisfaction which take possession of the Christian:  but be filled ivitli the Spirit  (v. 18); for the enjoy ment of that fulness of the Spirit satisfies the soul, and leaves it no longer a prey to intemperance or any such desires. But in what sense can the Christian be  EXHORTED  to be filled with the Spirit, when we call to mind that it is God alone by whom the Spirit is bestowed ? The answer is easy. It is of God's gracious gift when the Spirit replenishes any soul. But it is also a subject of exhortation. This is of the same nature with the exhortations in the Epistle to the Galatians: walk in the Spirit (Gal. v. 16, 25). The Father, in the cove nant, provided for the restoration of the Spirit; the Son pro cured the Spirit by His satisfaction, and lives to confer the gift; and we have only to receive and make room for Him daily, neither resisting nor grieving Him away from the heart.</p>
      <p> 1  See the beautiful remarks of Rev. Robert Hall on the work of the Spirit. "Vindictive passions," says he, "surround the soul with a sort of turbulent atmosphere, than which nothing can be conceived more opposite to that calm and holy light in which the blessed Spirit loves to dwell" (vol. i. p. 410).</p>
      
      <p> In the Epistle to the  PHILIPPIANS  several allusions to the Holy Spirit are found, having reference partly to Paul's own condition and partly to theirs. Errorists had not as yet troubled the Church from within, but marked intimations and warnings are given respecting them to this congregation, of whom the apostle always speaks with the deepest affection.</p>
      <p> After noticing the mixed motives of some who preached the gospel of contention, not sincerely, the apostle adds: " I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and  THE SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT  of Jesus Christ" (Phil. i. 19). According to his own declaration elsewhere, he was persuaded that all this would work together for good. Their prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Christ are not put together as co-ordinate. He means that all would redound to the victory of Christ's cause, and to his own highest advantage, through the supply (eV^op^/a) of the Spirit, while their prayer would be no unimportant sub ordinate link in the chain. As to the words here used, the Holy Spirit is called " the Spirit of Jesus Christ," not only because He is from the Son as well as from the Father, according to the eternal procession from both, but because the gift of the Spirit is derived from Christ's merits. He procured by his obedience and satisfaction not only the restoration of the divine favour, but the gift of the Holy Ghost, who is thus rightly called the Spirit of Christ. The more copious effusion of the Spirit is referred to the action of Christ no less than to the action of the Father, who gave to the Son the power of sending the Spirit, and of conferring all the benefits which were acquired by His death (Zech. xii. 10).</p>
      <p> The apostle expresses his confidence that the cause of the gospel would be promoted by the aid of the Spirit of Christ, who would not only cause the truth to triumph over false hood, but nerve him with necessary courage to seal, if need be, his testimony with his blood. But that no one might imagine that these results would be given to the indolent or lukewarm, the apostle links the supply (eVry;0/9777/a) of the Spirit with the prayers of believing men in the Church, to which he was writing; for he constantly asked prayer as a means of spreading Christian truth. Such is the weakness of human efforts, that we accomplish nothing unless the Holy Ghost is the guide and ruler of all our actions, and unless He is invocated, as it is here intimated that he should be invocated, by the Church, as alone able to bring help.</p>
      <p> To ward off the danger of disunion and mutual alienation, of which there was no little fear (iv. 2), the apostle bids them stand fast in  ONE SPIRIT  (i. 27); and at the commencement of the second chapter, he bases one of his arguments for unity, love, and concord on the fact that they had received the communication  (fellowship)  of the Spirit;  for this com munication evinces itself in unity and love.</p>
      <p> Another passage referring to the worship of God in the Spirit is: " We are the circumcision who  WORSHIP GOD IN THE SPIRIT,  and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no con fidence in the flesh" (iii. 3); the contrast being between worship in the Spirit and ritualistic tendencies. The apostle depreciates circumcision; he speaks of it as nothing better now than concision, and by contrast he says we are the cir cumcision, the spiritual Church. The next clause is:  who worship God in the Spirit,  as the result of regeneration, and as deduced from it. It is not to be resolved into the vague idea of spiritual worship, as commentators too commonly put it, but viewed as worship in the power of the Spirit; the term  Sjnrit  being plainly the echo of the promise: " I will pour out my Spirit on all ilesh." The reference is not so much to sanctification—though that, too, is comprehended—as to the adoption of sons; nor does the apostle stop there, for another equally important point is, that this worship of God in the Spirit discovers itself in the exercise-of rejoicing in Christ Jesus—that is,  as not leading away from Christ, but to Christ,  and inducing a reliance on Christ's merits and offices, and His whole mediatorial work.    And in that propor tion men abandon or forego all confidence in the flesh.</p>
      <p> The Pauline Epistles, which yet remain to be noticed, contain only a few additional allusions, and our survey of them may be brief.</p>
      <p> The Epistle to the  COLOSSIANS,  written to anchor the Church in sound doctrine against erroneous views, contains but one express allusion to the doctrine of the Spirit, though the whole Epistle implies it. The apostle, referring to Epaphras, says: " Who also declared to us  your love in the Spvrit " (i. 8). The Greek exegetes, followed by not a few Protestants, throw this into the vague phrase: " spiritual love," as contrasted with ordinary love in the relations of life. The love was to be exercised toward Paul, who was absent, and not personally known to the Colossians; and hence he calls it " your love in the Spirit," because the Spirit was its producing cause or author. The love to the saints was a fruit of the Spirit, as is elsewhere described.</p>
      <p> The Epistles to the  THESSALONIANS  contain the following allusions to the doctrine of the Spirit. When the apostle recalls their first reception of the gospel, he says: "Our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost,  and much assurance " (1 Thess. i. 5). Various interpretations have been given of these words, but they offer, really, little difficulty. The obvious meaning suggested by the antithesis is, that the gospel was accom panied with converting power; and when it is added : " and in the Holy Ghost," Calvin makes the expression refer merely to THE AUTHOR  of the previously mentioned power. Others refer the words to the gifts of the Spirit, especially the super natural gifts conferred upon believers in the apostolic age to confirm the truth (Gal. iii. 2). Whether we accept the one view or the other, there was a full certainty  (irX^po^opia),  a complete and perfect satisfaction, from which all dubiety was removed. According to this interpretation, the terms do not refer to the power with which Paul preached, as many suppose, but to the experience of the Thessalonians who received the Spirit.</p>
      <p> There are allusions also to the sin of despising the Spirit and of quenching the Spirit. As to the first, it is said: " He that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given to us His Holy Spirit" (1 Thess. iv. 8). This seems to refer to the inspiration and supernatural guidance given to the apostles in revealing divine truth. As to  quenching the Spirit (1 Thess. v. 19), the allusion must either be to supernatural gifts, as some interpret the passage, or to the testimony of the Spirit, which through sinful practices, indifference, or neglect, may be quenched. It is best to understand it of the supernatural operation of the Spirit, as the following verse, containing a warning not to despise prophecy, seems to imply.</p>
      <p> "  God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation THROUGH SANCTIFICATION  OF  THE SPIRIT  and belief of the truth " (2 Thess. ii. 13). The believing reception of the gospel was effected by the Spirit changing their hearts. The apostle, by the phrase: " the sanctification of the Spirit," means the cause by which their effectual calling was begun and carried out. The Spirit produced a full separation in heart and tone of mind from an ungodly world, thus setting apart all who were included in God's gracious purpose or decree. He works faith in them as the Spirit of sanctification.</p>
      <p> When we examine the two  EPISTLES TO TIMOTHY,  only two allusions to the doctrine of the Spirit call for special mention. In the first Epistle, He who was manifest in the flesh is said to be justified in the Spirit  (1 Tim. iii. 6). Of all the explana tions that have been attempted of this expression, only two deserve attention. The one is, that He had proclaimed Him self the Son of God, and been put to death as a blasphemer, and that He was now raised up by His own divine nature, and justified in all that He claimed to be. The other interpretation, which I prefer, is, that He was put to death under the charge of our imputed guilt, as our Surety, but justified by the Holy Spirit when He rose.</p>
      <p> The  SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY  repeats the frequent expression: " the Holy Ghost that dwelleth in us" (2 Tim. i. 14), which may be taken as the brief formula of all living Christianity. The charge to Timothy to keep the gospel doctrine committed to him, was to be carried out only by depend ence on the Spirit, and in believing prayer for His influences: " Keep through the  HOLY GHOST  which dwelleth in us."</p>
      <p> The  EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS,  which, with the Greek Church, I accept as of Pauline origin, brings out several points in the doctrine of the Spirit. As to the person of Christ, it sets forth how the Redeemer, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God (Heb. ix. 14), and how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost as the oil of gladness above His fellows as His reward (i. 9). The testi mony ta the work of the Spirit in the inspiration of Scripture is very emphatic,  e.g.:  the Holy Ghost says (Heb. iii. 7); the Holy Ghost signifying this (ix. 8); whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us (x. 15). The vast array of miracles and supernatural gifts with which the preaching of the gospel or the New Economy was ushered in is described as the accompanying testimony of God, with signs and wonders, and divers miracles and  GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST  according to His own will  (ii. 4). The two difficult passages which in volve the apostasy of some professing Christians after being made partakers of the Holy Ghost (vi. 4), and where the parties have done despite to the Spirit of grace (x. 29), are instances of men receiving only the supernatural gifts, 1  not true grace.</p>
      <p> 1  So Klinkcnberg puts it; compare Matt. vii. 22. If we take this view, which is every way preferable, we need not labour, as Owen and others have done, to meet the arguments of those who contend against the perseverance of the saints from this text.</p>
      
      <h1 class="caption">THE TESTIMONY OF JAMES.</h1>
      <p> The Epistle of James, directed against a nominal Chris tianity, or dead faith which had begun to prevail in his time, draws a line between nature and grace through all life. James contrasts spiritual religion with that forgetful hearing which, under the empty form, neither keeps itself unspotted from the world, nor exhibits the honour, the love, the benevolence which the law written on the heart prompts. He described that hollow profession by the licence given to the tongue, and by the vain boast of wisdom on which it plumed itself. Though he only once mentions the Spirit, the entire Epistle takes for granted the necessity of the Spirit's renewing grace. He bids those who lack wisdom ask it of God by believing prayer (Jas. i. 5). He implies the Spirit's agency when he says that every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (i. 17). He assumes the Spirit's work of regeneration by the word of truth as the foundation of all (i. 18). The tenor of the Epistle implies that the Holy Spirit, the author of faith, first enters the Christian heart as His habitation, and then makes it a temple worthy of Himself. In the only passage where he definitely names the Spirit, he emphatically expresses this, viz.: "  Do ye think that the Spirit saith in vain, The spirit that dwclleth in  ws  lusteth to envy ? "  This confessedly diffi cult passage is better translated: " Do you think that the Spirit speaketh in vain ? Doth  the spirit that dwclleth in us lust to envy ?" If we compare these words with the com mon style of the apostles, who speak of the Spirit as the great Inhabitant of the Christian heart, no doubt can exist that the allusion is to the Holy Spirit (Eom. viii. 9 ; 2 Tim. i. 14; 1 John iii. 34), who dwells in believers, and instructs, com forts, and sanctifies them. One of the most comprehensive descriptions of a Christian is that he is a man in whom theHoly Spirit dwells. The pointed inquiry of the Apostle James to the envious and contentious men to whom he addressed himself is: Can the Holy Spirit have His habi tation in a heart replete with envy ? And the emphatic answer, tacitly implied, is: No.  But  (that is, on the contrary, Se) He giveth more grace.  The meaning is: the Holy Spirit makes the man in whom He dwells to cherish no envy at another's welfare, but rather wish to see their blessings aug mented ; and the same Spirit gives more grace to him who is thus minded, or makes him the recipient of more grace. On that man he confers richer communications of grace. As to the interpretation of the passage, it is not without its diffi culties, as the quotation is not found in so many words in Scripture. Some refer it to the antediluvians (Gen. vi. 3), others to the Book of Proverbs (Prov. iii. 34). Not to mention far-fetched interpretations, it seems rather to refer to Moses' conduct in the matter of Eldad and Medad, when Joshua, from a desire for the honour of Moses, would have forbidden them to prophesy. But Moses said: "  Enmest tlwu for my sake?"  (Num. xi. 29).</p>
      <p> THE TESTIMONY OF PETEK.</p>
      <p> On the day of Pentecost Peter expounded and applied the prophecy of Joel as to the pouring out of the Spirit in the last days, pointing to the stupendous display of supernatural phenomena and of spiritual gifts, and declaring : " This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel" (Acts ii. 16). On another occasion he represented Jesus as anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power (x. 38). And as to the giving of the Spirit to the Gentiles, irrespective of all national distinc tions, he answered expressly that God gave them the Holy Ghost, and put no difference between the Jews and them (xv. 8).</p>
      <p> But let us more narrowly examine the Petrine Epistles. When we examine what titles Peter applies to the 'Spirit, we find the following: "the Spirit of Christ" (1 Pet. i. 11);  the, Spirit of God,  intimating God and the Spirit who proceeds from God (iv. 14); "the Spirit of glory," resting like the Shechina on the persecuted Christian (iv. 14). As to the ancient prophets, he says  THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST  which was in them testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow (i. 11); in a word, announced the cross and crown of the Redeemer. That passage furnished a convincing proof that Christ had a divine pre-existence, and that His Spirit, prior to the incarnation, guided the inspired writers in all their predictions. Attempts have been made, indeed, to explain this away; and modern divines, such as Weiss, who deny Christ's pre-existence, put this construction on the statement: that the Messiah - Spirit, before He came, was working in the prophets. For such an evacuating comment there exists no ground; it is but a fore gone Sabellian conclusion.</p>
      <p> Nor are we to explain the expression which is applied to Christ: " Put to death in the flesh, but quickened by  THE SPIRIT,"  in any other way than as an allusion to the Holy Ghost. It is neither Christ's human spirit simply, nor the divine nature of our Lord, though both interpretations have found almost equal favour with recent commentators. It appears from the following verse that we must rather think of the Holy Spirit in which, it is said, Christ went and preached to the spirits in prison—that is, by Noah as a preacher of righteousness. And we have only to compare this text with the passage previously expounded (1 Pet. i. 11), to be fully convinced that the reference is to the Spirit of Christ which was in the prophets. That the Redeemer was quickened and raised up by the Holy Spirit, is not obscurely intimated by the Apostle Paul (Rom. viii. 11). The same Spirit that formed Christ's human body and gave it life in His mother's womb, gave to Him the restored life when He rose from the dead. He who raised up Christ from the dead, indeed, is frequently mentioned as one of the Father's most memorable titles or designations; and to prove that it was the Spirit who performed this work, we have only to recall the fact that the Holy Ghost is the executive in every divine operation (Eom. iv. 24, vi. 4).</p>
      <p> To the Spirit also is ascribed the Christian's sauctification: " Elect,  IN  (eV) sanctification of the Spirit,  TO  obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ"  (1  Pet. i. 2). The Holy Spirit, by the gospel, separates Christians, or sets them apart, in a peculiar way, from the common mass of men; and the blessings enjoyed are the fruit of the Spirit's sanctify ing power. As the prophets had the Spirit, so, Peter adds, the apostles, in like manner, preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven (i. 12). In the second Epistle it must be noticed that the only allusion to the Spirit is in connection with the inspiration of the prophets, who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2 Pet. i. 21).</p>
      <h1 class="caption"> THE TESTIMONY OF THE APOSTLE JUDE.</h1>
      <p> The  EPISTLE OF JUDE  was directed against a body of licentious errorists who had crept into the Church, and were corrupting it by their doctrines and practice. These were evil, and there was no room to entertain doubts respecting their character. The apostle accordingly appeals, by way of warning, to some terrible instances of judgment recorded in Scripture—to the Israelites who were destroyed in their unbelief after coming out of Egypt (ver. 5); to the angels who kept not their first estate (ver. 6); to Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbouring cities (ver. 7). Two references are made to the Holy Spirit within the compass of this small Epistle,—the one alluding to the errorists, the other to the Christians whom he exhorts.</p>
      <p> 1. " These are they who separate themselves, sensual (•^rv^iKoi),  having not the Spirit" (ver. 19). The adjective rendered  semual  here and in the Epistle of James (Jas. iii. 15) is elsewhere rendered  natural,  or the natural man (1 Cor. ii. 14). The expression means simply one in a state of nature, or unregenerate, and without the Spirit. This cannot be doubtful to any one who considers the antithesis in which it is placed by three apostles. Expositors have brought more learning to the elucidation of the term  (•^•V^JLKOL}  than was necessary. What a natural man denotes is easily discerned by the antithesis in which it stands to  the spiritual  man, who is one that has received the Spirit. The natural man is one who has merely natural reason, not the Spirit,—that is, the animal man, as Melanchthon expounds it,—one living accord ing to reason, like Zeno or Saul, though not necessarily in gross vices. As to the next phrase:  having not the Spirit,  it conveys the idea that the natural man has not the Spirit, and is the antithesis to what is said, that the true Christian  HAS the Spirit. On the contrary, he who has not the Spirit is not Christ's (Eoin. viii. 9). We must understand the Holy Spirit, and the apostle pronounces it an indisputable truth that natural men, whether addicted to the grosser vices, like those errorists, or practically exempt from them,  have not the Spirit —that is, do not possess the Holy Spirit, who, as a divine inhabitant, occupies the heart of all believers, and sanctifies and renews them after the divine image.</p>
      <p> 2. The second reference to the Spirit in this Epistle, interwoven with other essential elements of the spiritual life, is: " But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,  PRAYING IN THE HOLY GHOST,  keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life" (vers. 20, 21). This implies a life in the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, a life of prayer resulting from that fellowship. The Christians to whom the apostle wrote are exhorted to build themselves up on their faith, which implies all the objects of faith as a foundation. They are taught that they are not simply to be passive, but to some extent active in the process, and especially taught  to pray in the Holy Ghost,  who prompts the matter of all true prayer,—opening men's eyes to discover their poverty, and showing them the value of spiritual things,—exciting true faith,—and imbuing them with right affections. All true prayer is shown to be prayer in the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <h1 class="caption"> THE TESTIMONY OF THE APOSTLE JOHN.</h1>
      <p> On the subject of the Holy Spirit we find comparatively little in the Epistles of John—less, in fact, than every one expects to find when he comes to the examination of it. The reason might be that the Gospel of John had set forth in the Lord's own words the most full and exhaustive delineation of the doctrine of the Spirit, and we are supposed to carry those disclosures of His Gospel with us in the perusal of the Epistle and Apocalypse.</p>
      <p> Though the Epistle alludes more to the Spirit's work than to the personal relations of the Trinity, there are passages which show Him personally distinct from the Father and the Son. As often as the apostle speaks of the Spirit, he speaks of Him as communicated (1 John ii. 20), and as given to us (1 John iii. 24); and he plainly shows that he regards the communication as imparted to us by the Son. As to the names or titles given to Him, He is called the Spirit of God (1 John iv. 2), sent forth from God (e/e  TOU  &amp;eov,  1 John iv. 3); the Spirit of truth, because He opens the mind to truth, and teaches it to distinguish truth from error (1 John iv. 6). He is called the unction from the Holy One, who anoints the followers of Christ as He anointed Christ Himself (1 John ii. 20, 27).</p>
      <p> It is said, the Spirit is truth (1 John v. 6); the meaning of which, in that connection, seems to be that one may securely rely on the testimony of the Spirit as an infallible witness, because He is the truth itself.</p>
      <p> We have specially to inquire in what sense  THE SPIRIT  is said  TO BEAR WITNESS  in the much canvassed passage which refers to the  THREE WITNESSES  on earth (1 John v. 6, S). 1 Without subjecting all the opinions to examination, it may suffice to say that the  WATER  and  BLOOD  first named cannot naturally be referred to the two sacraments, or to the blood and water which flowed from the pierced side of our Lord, though both opinions are maintained by eminent expositors. We rather understand by the first witness, Christ's baptism and the miraculous events connected with it, which clearly attested His Messianic commission. We must understand by THE BLOOD,  His departure to the Father, or the termination of His earthly task by the atoning sacrifice, which was accompanied by the most striking miracles (Matt, xxvii. 51). The  THIRD WITNESS,  that of  THE SPIRIT,  is none other than the effusion of the Spirit, first given on the day of Pentecost, the Spirit that spoke by the mouth of all the apostles, who preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven—the Spirit who accompanied their oral testimony with stupendous miracles, and who moved them in their writings. The apostle's words were accompanied with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost (Heb. ii. 4). But it was not all objective. The Spirit's testimony was also internal—that is, He made all internally efficacious and available to the elect.</p>
      <p> The apostle refers also to Christian assurance when he says: " We know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given us" (1 John iii. 24 and iv. 13). As Paul calls the Spirit the  EARNEST,  so John declares that the Holy Spirit given to Christians gives them a knowledge and an assurance of divine love.</p>
      <p> I have now briefly to refer to  THE APOCALYPSE,  the only remaining work of the Apostle John. The salutation with</p>
      <p> 1  All text-critics and exegetes now let go 1 John v. 7 as no longer tenable. It was probably a mere note on the margin inserted in the text by a subsequent transcriber, which the book opens contains an allusion to the Spirit, but in a way peculiar to John. Paul's manner in invocating blessings on the several Churches to whom he writes was to ask " grace and peace from God the Fatfier and the Lord Jesus Christ;" and he does not name the Spirit, because the Spirit was implied or understood in the blessings which were communicated. They were imparted by the agency of the Holy Ghost, who applies redemption. John, according to his peculiar manner, invocates grace and peace from the whole Trinity,—from the Father, called " Him who is, and who was, and who is to come;"  FROM THE SPIRIT, represented as the seven Spirits which are before the throne; and from Jesus Christ (Rev. i. 4). The seven Spirits in the plural indicate the manifold and various operations of the Holy Ghost in the application of grace, with a reference to the seven gifts mentioned in Isaiah (xi. 2), or with an allusion to the seven Churches. Throughout the Apocalypse this style of description is repeatedly used to represent the Spirit as resting on Christ for the great ends which were involved in the execution of the Covenant. Thus, in the third chapter, we read : " These things saith He that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars" (Rev. iii. 1). In the fourth chapter the apostle describes a door opened in heaven, while the writer says : " Immediately I was in the Spirit" (iv. 2); and he adds: " there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God " (iv. 5). In the fifth chapter, the apostle describes what he beheld in connection \vith the book written within and without, and sealed with seven seals, which no man in heaven or in earth could open: " I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are THE SEVEN SPIRITS  of God sent forth into all the earth." The design of these passages was to set forth the communication of the Holy Spirit in the infinite supplies which Christ imparts, as the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord (Isa. xi. 2), and as all resting on Christ.</p>
      <p> The apostle says at the beginning: " I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day " (i. 10). When Christ sends the seven Epistles to the seven Churches, He bids them hear what the Spirit speaketh to the Churches (ii. 7); for it is the personal Holy Ghost that speaks in and by the gospel, and that speaks in all the word of truth. And the book closes with the call: "THE  SPIRIT  and the Bride say, Come "—that is, the Church moved by the Spirit says, " Conie."</p>
      
      <h1 class="caption"> SECOND   DIVISION. LECTUEE   I.</h1>
      <h2 class="caption"> THE PERSONALITY AND PROCESSION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h2>
      <p> I purpose to discuss to-day the  DIVINE PERSONALITY  of the Holy Spirit. This is a point on which few doubts may be entertained by the vast majority of believing men among us. But it must not be passed over.  Nor  must attention be absorbed with the  WORK  of the Spirit so as to forget  HIMSELF.  All history proves, for instance, that to give exclusive prominence to the work of Christ while the personal Eedeemer is left in the background, ends, for the most part, in placing a mere dogma where Christ Himself should be. The divine dignity of the Spirit demands, in like manner, that no obscuring influence shall come between the soul and the agency of the living person; and in the whole investigation on which it is necessary to enter, we must be upon our guard against being swayed either by the sound of words, which decide nothing, or by those refining speculations which are more shadowy than solid.</p>
      <p> As to the divine personality of the Spirit, there are two modes by which we prove it. We prove it  a priori,  from the fact of the eternal procession, as we prove the divine per sonality of the Son from the fact of the eternal generation; for these immanent acts of God underlie respectively the per sonal distinctions in the Godhead. Or we prove it  a posteriori, from the unquestionable evidences of divine personality which are given in the sacred Scriptures in connection with His works. We shall begin with the latter, and proceed step by step, taking up in order first the  PERSONALITY,  and then the PROCESSION  of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> It is clear to every mind that, after His personality is established, no further proof can reasonably be demanded to show that such a Person must be God. If He is not an in fluence or energy, but a personal agent, it follows on grounds the most conclusive that He is not lower than Supreme God. Hence the objections adduced in opposition to the doctrine of the Spirit mainly turn at present against the proof of His personality. For to no created being can the actions which are ascribed to Him be fitly or competently applied.</p>
      <p> My object is to show that the Spirit of God is as truly a Person as the Father or the Son,—a Person in whom mind resides, and to whom men perform actions which are either culpable or acceptable. That divine personality is asserted against two currents of opinion which agitated the Church in early times,—the Sabellian and Arian heresies, which reci procally evoked each other, and are ever ready to captivate minds which miss the safe middle way. The former is the negation of the Spirit's personality, the latter the denial of His Deity. All who deviate in our day from the Church-doctrine are led by a strong Sabellian bias to consider the Holy Spirit as a mere influence or divine energy without per sonality,—a theory called the indwelling scheme by some, but only a form of Unitarianism. The Arian or Macedonian opinion, which described the Spirit as a creature, is little favoured at present, but may at any moment reappear, accord ing to the strange vitality which is the accompaniment of error. At present Sabellianism is the error of wide diffusion and power, and it is adopted by many who come under the spell of German theology. These theologians evade the force of the Scripture proof by treating ths passages as rhetorical personifications or figures of speech, even while they dilate on the advantages of using only the grammatico-historical method of interpretation. They speak not of the Holy Spirit, but of the COMMON SPIRIT  OF THE CHRISTIAN  CHURCH, which, in fact, means nothing more than an  esprit de corps,  and detaches itself from all obligation to accept the doctrine of the personal Holy Ghost. How far modern theology is alienated from this en tire domain of doctrine is known only to those whose special studies have led them to institute inquiries as to the German current of theological thought, and as to the multitudes in every land who have come under its influence. The per sonality of the Holy Ghost is treated by these divines as a dogma, for the acceptance of which no sufficient ground is found either in Scripture or experience. 1</p>
      <p> When Scripture alludes to the Holy Spirit, the personal terms conveying the idea of  MIND, WILL,  and  SPONTANEOUS ACTION  are so numerous that they may be regarded, not as the occasional, but as the general, nay, uniform and unvaried usage; and it is a usage observed by all the sacred writers, without a single exception. It is observed by the Old Tes tament writers and by the New Testament writers alike. It is retained as the natural expression of their thoughts, even in passages where the writers, without the slightest trace of emotion or elevation in their style, write and speak as simple narrators of historic facts (Acts ii. 15), or convey plain and practical instruction (Eph. iv. 30). To deny that there is any allusion to a person in such references to the Spirit, betrays either deep-seated bias and prejudice, or lack of exegetical aptitude and capacity.</p>
      <p> 1  Dr. Kahnis says, in the preface to his work,  die Lehre vom Heiligen Geiste, 1847, of which only a first part was published : "  was die neuere Theoloyie betrijft,  so sagt Baumgarten-Crusius  (compendium der Dogmen Geschichte,  ii. p. 189, Anm. 4),  dass der neuere Protestantismus die Personlichkeit des Heiligen Geistes aufgegeben hat.  Das wenigstens ist wahr dass die strengkirchliche Dog-matik diese Lehre ziemlich unvermittelt hinstellt,  die Vermittelnde Theologie  der man Kirchlichen Grund und Boden nicht stteitig machen kann,  meist negativ dazu steht. "</p>
      
      <p> To evade or explain away these proofs of personality, two modes have been adopted, having not even the semblance of probability. The one evasion is, that the expressions mean nothing more than  AN ABSTRACT QUALITY  ; and the other is, that they are instances of  TROPICAL LANGUAGE.  It may suffice to reply, that few examples of rhetorical personification occur in any history written in simple prose, and that this holds true pre-eminently of the New Testament, where the writers of set purpose make use of a natural, popular style. In these perspicuous narratives, there was neither occasion nor scope in any of the allusions to the Holy Spirit for a highly figura tive diction ; and when a personal agent is referred to, it is out of keeping with the nature of their composition to under stand the terms of a quality or influence. We must under stand one in whom intelligence arid will reside. It would be the most violent and far-fetched of all conceivable modes of interpretation, to lay it down as a rule—as this theory must do—that whenever the speakers or writers, either in the Old or New Testament, turned their mind toward the doctrine of the Spirit, they instantly abandoned all the plain and easy style familiar to them, and resorted to rhetorical personifica tion, prosopopcea, and the most high-wrought figures which language can sustain, when their object was to be understood in the language which they used. To suppose such- a thing is a sufficient refutation of that whole mode of interpretation. If Jesus and His apostles uniformly represented the Holy Spirit as a Person when He is not a Person, it would be the boldest personification ever found in any literature upon any subject.</p>
      <p> Not only so; the apostles lived at a time when their assailants, the Gnostics, transmuted divine operations into emanations and persons. We may therefore, with Michaelis, pronounce it impossible—a thing, certainly, not to be believed —that they should so frequently resort to rhetorical personifi cation in reference to the Holy Ghost, and thus give occasion to regard Him as a Person, if, in the use of such terms, they did not think of Him as possessed of a divine personality.</p>
      <p> It is not denied that there are passages where impersonal things are so described that at first they might seem to be taken as personal qualities. The two instances most frequently adduced are these: " The wind bloweth where it  listeth,"  and " The blood of sprinkling that  speaketh  better things than that of Abel" (Heb. xii. 24). No man of ordinary capacity, will ing to weigh the force of words, will for a moment doubt that these are figurative expressions, personifications which no man can mistake. The delineation of charity is so given (1 Cor. xiii. 1—8) that we may call it another instance of this personification. Every one sees that it is a vivid way of de--picting the various activities of love in the whole conduct of a living Christian. But it is a wholly different case when we can show, in reference to the doctrine of the Spirit, that this mode of speaking is general, unvaried, uniform; that it is adopted by all the sacred writers with one consent; and that it is retained even in the simplest passages where they narrate facts or give plain instruction.</p>
      <p> It is common among modern theologians, swayed by a Sabellian bias, to allege that the name " Spirit of God" means no more than God Himself, without reference to a personal distinction which, indeed, they do not believe; that Scripture contains such anthropomorphisms as the face of God, the name of God, the soul of God, as metaphors for God Him self ; and that the expression " Spirit of God" is of similar import. To meet this misapprehension, it is not enough to show that the Spirit is possessed of divine properties, but that He is also personally distinct from the Father and the Son. The fact that the Spirit is named as occupying a co-ordinate rank with the other persons of the Godhead, supplies a valid argument against which no objection can be advanced.</p>
      <p> It is also urged that the term  PERSON  is not Biblical, and is capable of being much perverted. But every thoughtful inquirer perceives that the terrn " person" is only used for convenience' sake; that it is an ecclesiastical usage, like the words trinity, sacrament, and the like; and that it became current in the Oriental as well as Western Church, simply because a generic term was found necessary to point out the three subsistents in the Godhead. It has at the same time been always admitted that the use of this particular term was adopted only to avoid circumlocution; and that if a better term could be substituted for it with a general consent, no one would contend for it as indispensable. But with the doctrine underlying the expression the case is wholly different. That cannot be surrendered. Only remove from the use of the term every notion involving imperfection, as we do without difficulty when eyes, ears, or fingers are applied to God, from the mere lack of vocables to express the fit idea, and it must be admitted that in human language no term can be found better fitted to express the Church's meaning than the term person. Because we must use intelligible language, no diffi culty should be felt in calling the Holy Spirit a Person.</p>
      <p> The evidence for the personality of the Holy Spirit, it may be remarked, though often indirect, is not less convincing. For the Scriptures were not written in such a way as to over bear those who challenge every statement till they are subdued by evidence, and who commonly find or make the stumbling-blocks which they wish to meet, but for true inquirers, for receptive minds and honest hearts, which feel the need of redemption, and can be satisfied with a sufficient amount of evidence. The evidence consists in the uniform teaching of Scripture, and in the fact that no counter statements refute it. It amounts to this: (1) That the Spirit is not the Father or the Son, but distinct from both; (2) that He is an agent possessed of intelligence and will, power and wisdom, which come to light in deeds performed with a design; (3) that the masculine pronouns applied to Him, and the nature of the mission on which He is sent, attest a Person.</p>
      
      <p> The Scriptures distinctly recognise the Spirit as a Person. We have only to recall the language used in reference to  THE COMFORTER  to be convinced of this. To compensate for the loss incurred by the departure of the Lord Jesus to the Father, He promised that He would send another Comforter, who should take His place as their immediate Teacher, Helper, and Protector, and thus supply the want of His own presence, the anticipated loss of which filled them with trouble and dismay. When we look at the Persons referred to in that promise, it would be a perversion of language to suppose that a mere quality or influence is meant in any of the personal allusions. The sender is certainly different from the person who is sent: for we do not speak of sending a quality on an errand. Nor does  ANY ONE SEND HIMSELF FROM HIMSELF,  as the Sabellian 1  must put it when he interprets the words: " When  THE COMFORTER  is come, whom I  WILL  send to you  FROM  the Father" (John xv. 26). Whether we accept one rendering or another of the word Comforter, whether we make it  TEACHER  with Ernesti, or  HELPER,  or  ADVOCATE,  or PATRON  with others, it is obvious to every mind that He who was to compensate the disciples and the Church, of which they were the first - fruits, for the loss of Christ's visible presence, was certainly a Person. The refusal to accept the Spirit's personality in that text compels the interpreter, if consistent with himself,  TO DENY THE PERSONALITY OF CHRIST in whose room He came. That is the alternative before him which no ingenuity can evade. And the absurdity is not less obvious of identifying the title Comforter or Paraclete with the impersonal gifts which the apostles subsequently received. That such a comment is untenable, is clear from the explicit announcements that the Spirit should teach them all things (John xiv. 26); guide them into all truth (xvi. 13); bring all things to their remembrance (xiv. 26); glorify Christ by</p>
      <p> ' l   See  e.g.   Dr.  Weiss'   Lehrbuch der Biblischen   Theoloyw,  1868 ;   Grimm's WUMs Lexicon,  1868,—both in a Sabellian tendency.</p>
      
      <p> receiving of His, and showing it to His disciples (xvi. 14). It is not possible more explicitly to distinguish a person from the works which he performs. Nor ought we to omit a note worthy peculiarity in the  THREE  passages which refer to the Comforter. A change of gender in the use of the masculine demonstrative pronoun (e/eetvo?) forestalls the possibility of putting any other sense than a personal reference upon the words. Thus it is said: " The Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, He  (eicelvos')  shall teach you all things" (John xiv. 26); "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from the Father, He (e/cetz/o?) shall testify of me ;" " Howbeit, when He  (eiceivos),  the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of [better: from] Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak, and He will show you things to come. He (e'/cetf09) shall glorify me" (xvi. 13, 14).</p>
      <p> The unbiassed sense of unlettered men, who are beyond the influence of the theological currents, is alive to the fact that the meaning of many passages is lost, unless we think of the Holy Ghost as a Person, and not as a mere influence or energy. To lie to the Holy Ghost (Acts v. 3), to grieve the Holy Spirit of God (Eph. iv. 30), are expressions which, as every reflecting mind perceives, imply a Person who is pleased or displeased; and they cannot, with any propriety or fitness, be referred to what is impersonal.</p>
      <p> The Book of Acts, specially prepared, as we have seen, to exhibit historically the Spirit's operations in the Church after the Lord's ascension, contains allusions to the personal leading of the Spirit on the mind of all Christ's servants, and in the formation of the various Churches. Thus He said to Philip, who had been directed to the way along which the chamber lain of the Ethiopian Queen was returning home: " Go near and join thyself to this chariot" (viii. 29); and after that mission was successfully accomplished, the Spirit of the Lord</p>
      
      <p> caught away Philip (viii. 39). To Peter, when the deputation from Cornelius arrived at Joppa, the Spirit said: " Behold, three men seek thee" (x. 19). When Saul of Tarsus was set apart to his great Gentile commission, which made him in a peculiar sense the apostle of the Gentiles, the Holy Ghost said to the prophets and teachers who were ministering to the Lord in the Church at Antioch : " Separate to me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them " (xiii. 2). When Paul and Timothy attempted to go into Bithynia, the Spirit suffered them not (xvi. 7). When the members constituting the council at Jerusalem gave forth the result of their delibera tions for the guidance of the Churches in reference to the observance of the Jewish rites, they said: " It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us" (xv. 28)—language which could not have been used if the Holy Spirit were nothing but an influence. When He commissioned the apostles, and either directed or forbade them to do this or that according to His will, the language attests a free and sovereign agent, unless we are prepared to abandon the literal sense of words and  the style of historic narrative. Fritzsche, in his learned treatise on the Spirit, 1  correctly maintains — though the treatise is unsatisfactory as a statement of ecclesiastical doctrine—that it is clear as noon-day that Scripture speaks of a Person or subsistence, not of a divine influence or energy; and the Christian Church from the beginning, notwithstanding the deflections of individuals, may be said to have asserted the Spirit's personality, and to have based it on the Scriptures. Collecting the evidence supplied by the survey of Scripture, we may put the arguments for the personality of the Spirit under the six following heads:—</p>
      <p> 1.   The   personal   actions   ascribed   to   Him  abundantly</p>
      <p> prove it (John xiv. 26 ; 1 Cor. xii. 11).</p>
      <p> 2.   His distinction from the Father and the Son, and His</p>
      <p> mission from both, prove it (John xv. 26).</p>
      <p> 1  Dr. Christ.  Frid. Fritzsche,  Nova Opuscula Academica,  1846.</p>
      
      <p> 3.   The co-ordinate rank and power which belong to Him</p>
      <p> equally with the Father and the Son prove it (Matt. xxviii. 19; 2 Cor. xiii. 14).</p>
      <p> 4.   His appearance under a visible form at the baptism of</p>
      <p> Christ and on the day of Pentecost proves it.</p>
      <p> 5.   The sin against  the   Holy Ghost  implying   a   Person</p>
      <p> proves it.</p>
      <p> 6.   The way in which He is distinguished from His gifts</p>
      <p> proves it (1 Cor. xii. 11).</p>
      <p> The glorification of the Holy Ghost in connection with the Church is still future. Passage after passage might be adduced to show that He occupies a co-ordinate rank with the other Persons. But the completion of the Church opens a vista into the future. The appearance of Christ among men ushered in a full historical revelation of the Son in word and deed; and the abasement to which He stooped was followed by an equally conspicuous exaltation. With the Holy Ghost it is not so as yet. He dwells in redeemed hearts bought with a price. He occupies a co-ordinate rank. But His luork is still unseen.  The personality and Deity of the Spirit are, however, one day to be displayed in con spicuous glory in connection with His work upon the Church, when He shall have completed the marvellous transformation. The final issue in the glory reflected from every redeemed and perfected saint, and from the entire body of Christ now scattered over every country, and visited from hour to hour with new communications of wisdom, grace, and power, but then seen to be united to their glorious Head, will be worthy of the divine workman who is carrying on His transforming work, and raising up a temple in which the Godhead shall dwell for ever. At present the divine personality of the Spirit is less perceptible, because it is not beheld in connec tion with the accomplished work. The redeemed are not yet perfect; the Church is not yet complete. There is still another stage of revelation, when the Spirit shall be glorified</p>
      
      <p> in connection with the work which He shall have finished and brought to its destined completeness. 1</p>
      <p> ON THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> The words of Christ on which this discussion largely turns are these: " When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who pro-ceedeth from the Father" (John xv. 26). These three things challenge our attention: (1) The mission of the Spirit by Christ from the Father; (2) the essential relation prior to that mission, and on which that mission rests: " who pro-ceedeth from the Father" (6  irapa rov irarpo^ eKTropeverai); the words " from the Father" corresponding to what is said of the generation of the Son, the Only-begotten "from the Father "  (irapa Trarpo^ ;  (3) the present tense, " proceedeth," intimates an immanent ever-during present.</p>
      <p> Some hold that the name  HOLY SPIRIT  refers exclusively to His office in man's salvation. But it is necessary to distin guish when truth and error are confusedly put together. The designation  SPIRIT OF GOD  is the distinctive name of the third person of the Godhead, denoting a divine subsistent, with intelligence and will, proceeding from another. The epithet HOLY,  frequently conjoined with the term  SPIRIT,  gives us a nearer view of the Spirit's  SPECIAL WORK  in connection with man's salvation, and suggests an antithesis to every unholy spirit, whether human or Satanic. The procession of the Spirit is spoken of by our Lord in connection with a refer ence to the covenant of grace,* and doubtless the reason is to show that the natural order in the Godhead is also the order in the execution of the covenant of grace. Had we no other word of Scripture through which to think on this matter, the single title "  THE SPIRIT OF GOD  " shows the rela-</p>
      <p> 1   This is well brought out in Schmid's  Biblische Theologie,  p. 167.</p>
      <p> 2   See Lampe's Latin  Disputations on the Spirit  (vol. ii. p. 151 ff.).</p>
      
      <p> tion of two Persons, the one proceeding from the other, just as the title " the Son of God" proves the eternal Sonship. He is called—(1) the Spirit of the Lord (Isa. xi. 2); (2) the Spirit of God (Eom. viii. 9); (3) the Spirit that proceedeth from the Father (John xv. 26) ; (4) the Spirit of His Son (Gal. iv. 6); and we should grievously err if we believed that these phrases have no significance. We ascribe no such procession to Him as is in any way associated with the idea of imperfection. We acknowledge, however, something fitly represented by the analogy of respiration, for it would be irreverence to imagine that there is no «naloo:v in the terms</p>
      <p> O  O«-&lt;</p>
      <p> employed.</p>
      <p> The more the matter is discussed, the more is Scripture found to warrant the position that, in the scheme of grace, the acts of the Persons of the Trinity are found to be accord ing to their order of subsistence in the Godhead, and are but the visible manifestation of that order in the divine essence. The Spirit could not be called the Spirit of the Father, or the Spirit of Him who raised up Christ from the dead (Horn. viii. 11), unless He proceeded from the Father. He could not be called the Spirit of His Son (Gal. iv. 6), or the Spirit of Christ (Eom. viii. 9), because He replenished the humanity of Jesus. Nor does it appear how the Spirit could be sent by Him except upon the footing of that procession by which He is the Spirit of the Son as well as the Spirit of the Father, and which is eternally continued without a past and without a future. The question is important in every respect, because it lies at the foundation of the  MISSION OF THE COMFORTER. And as to its practical results, Church history informs us that it is in the last degree calamitous to ignore it. 1</p>
      <p> Some divines, in other respects orthodox, have recently taken exception to the eternal procession, as they also do to the eternal Sonship. Thus the author of an excellent work</p>
      <p> 1  See an excellent paper referring to the practical importance of this question, in Rudelbach's  Zeitsc/irift fiir Lutherische Thcoloyie,  1849, p. 13.</p>
      
      <p> on the Spirit, while soundly Trinitarian as to the action of the three divine Persons in the covenant of grace, unhappily says: " The spiration, procession, or promanation of the Spirit from the Father, or from the Father and the Son, are phrases occupying no mean place in the theology of the early ages. Now,  we humbly submit—whatever reverence may be due to holy synods and to learned men—that such explanations are founded on an erroneous principle, for they are  analyses of human thoughts or words,  not developments of divine realities" (p. 82). 1  They whose sentiments are thus re-echoed (viz. Eoellius of Holland, Dr. Wardlaw, Prof. Moses Stuart, and the like) dismiss the subject of the procession with summary marks of impatience. But by so doing they cut themselves off from the Patristic literature, as well as from the Reforma tion, Puritan, and Anglican theology. The Scripture evidence in support of the procession is conclusive; and it is set forth in a mass of solid literature, from the earliest times to the present day. The question of the procession, analogous as it is in all respects to the question of the eternal Sonship, deserves and rewards a full investigation.</p>
      <p> They who err in this article depart from the confession of a doctrine which the entire Church of God has taught and enforced from the days of the apostles. And the denial of this truth carries with it the most perilous consequences. (1) If there be no generation or procession, and if the names FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT  have respect merely to the covenant of grace, it would follow that these names are but official names, and have no essential relation underlying them. (2) It would follow that the Father could act in an isolated way without the Son and Holy Spirit, and that they, again, could act from themselves apart from the Father, without any natural and necessary relation of the one to the other. (3) It would follow that the bond of unity between the Persons was really subverted or overthrown. These perilous conse-</p>
      <p> 1   The Work of the Spirit,  by William Hendry Stowell.    London, 1849.</p>
      
      <p> quences, especially the two last, may be repudiated; and far be it from me to burden any man or class of men with con sequences which they do not themselves accept and avow. But the consequences which are admitted are one thing, and the consequences which follow logically from an opinion are another thing. The consequences may be of potent influence though neither suspected nor acknowledged.</p>
      <p> The point to which we have adverted is at the foundation of the unity and distinction in the Godhead. The three Persons have a natural relation to each other, both in subsistence and action. They are one in essence and in operation.</p>
      <p> The Biblical foundation of the doctrine that the Spirit is FROM THE SON  as well as from the Father is explicit. Thus it is said : " He shall glorify me : for He shall receive of mine, and show it unto you" (John xvi. 14). The import  is:   HE SHALL,  in the sphere of divine truth and revelation,  DELIVER ONLY WHAT  I  HAVE TAUGHT,  and by so doing,  GLORIFY ME  as a divine teacher; for it redounds to Christ's glory that no other doctrine should be taught but that which was derived from Him. Christ had declared of His own doctrine that it was not His, but the Father's who sent Him, and that He taught nothing but what He had heard of His Father—that is,  the, Son received all from His Father in the eternal generation (John xv. 15); and the Spirit receives all by procession from the Son in the same way as the Spirit of the Son.</p>
      <p> The same thing is elsewhere set forth as follows: "  For He shall not speak of Himself  [better :  from Himself]  (d&lt;/&gt;' eairroG); but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak " (John xvi. 13). As the Son said regardiug Himself: "What I hear, I speak," referring to His ineffable immanence in the Father, so the declaration that the Spirit should  NOT SPEAK FROM HIMSELF,  implies that He spoke nothing but what the Father and Son spoke by Him. There is a certain order, but no isolation of the one Person from the other ; and the twice-</p>
      
      <p> repeated statement: " He shall receive of mine,"—united as it is with the declaration that the Son has the essence, attri butes, and perfections that the Father has,—enables us to understand what is involved in this procession—viz. that the Holy Ghost receives the same numerical divine essence with the Father and the Son.</p>
      <p> Such has been the belief of the Church from the first as set forth in all the creeds. It must be accepted  AS ESSENTIAL</p>
      <p> TO   THE   PERFECTION   OF   THE   DIVINE   NATURE   that  the Father</p>
      <p> have a Son, and that there should be a Spirit proceeding from them both. The phrase:  who proccedeth from the Father,  in the present tense (e/cTropeuerat), intimates an immanent, in ternal, ever-during act according to the unchangeable essence of the Deity.</p>
      <p> THE DEITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BASED ON THE PROCESSION.</p>
      <p> The  SUPREME DEITY OF THE SPIRIT  is clearly established by the procession of the Spirit. The expression through which we think, whenever we direct attention to this doctrine, is the designation  THE SPIRIT OF GOD.  Like the analogous designa tion "the Son of God," it sets forth a unique relation, or a personal distinction, before any work was done. And as we say that the only Son is supreme God, not although He is the Son, but  because  He was begotten of the Father; so we say that the Spirit is supreme God, not although, but  because  He proceedeth from the Father and the Son.</p>
      <p> The following fivefold line of proof, when carried out to its legitimate consequences, and all taking for granted the procession from the Father and the Son, furnishes conclusive proof of the supreme Deity of the Holy Spirit:—</p>
      <p> 1.   The  incommunicable  acts  of creation  and  providence</p>
      <p> ascribed to the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 2.   Divine attributes ascribed to Him.</p>
      <p> 3.   Divine honours and worship paid to Him.</p>
      
      <p> 4.   The co-ordinate rank in which He is placed with the</p>
      <p> Father and the Son.</p>
      <p> 5.   The name of God indirectly given to Him.</p>
      <p> 1. The creation and conservation of all things are attri buted to the Spirit of God (Gen. i. 6 ; Ps. xxxiii. 6 ; Job xxvi. 13). He who summoned the world into being, with its countless laws, adjustments, and concurrent adaptations, is supreme God. The conservation of the stupendous fabric by what is tantamount to a sustained creation, the knowledge necessary for a task beyond finite comprehension, the power that never faints, and the vigilance that never slumbers, argue the ever-present activity of supreme God.  But all that creative energy  which evoked the universe out of nothing, and all the conserving Providence  which sustains it, are  ascribed to the Spirit of God.  To speak of delegation, as the Arians have done, is a hypothesis which needs but to be uttered to be repudiated. For to whom could such activity be delegated  1 Who could wield the perfections which such a task implies, but He to whom these divine perfections naturally belong ? The prophet Isaiah, as if to laugh to scorn the notion of a delegated activity in such a sphere, thus exclaims: " Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance ? Who hath directed  the Spirit of the Lord,  or, being His coiinsellor, hath taught Him ?" A consideration of the universe with the light which modern science has shed upon its laws, adjusted as they are with the finest adaptation over all the realms of nature, affords such a view of the wisdom necessary to plan, and of the power necessary to uphold them, that none but a divine hand was equal to the task.  But that hand was the Spirit's.  And the same argument applies to all the other acts of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 2. As to the  DIVINE ATTRIBUTES  ascribed to the Spirit, we</p>
      
      <p> may choose out of the supply of materials furnished to our hand a few of the properties of supreme Godhead, which He is said to possess, such as omniscience, omnipresence, and eternity.</p>
      <p> We find  OMNISCIENCE  affirmed of the Spirit when it is said: " God hath revealed them to us by  His Spirit:  for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the Spirit of man which is in Him ? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" (1 Cor. ii. 10, 11). The apostle says that he was in a position to unfold the purposes of God, because God revealed them to him by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. This is elucidated in the following verse by an illus tration of a man knowing the things of a man by the Spirit of man which is in him. The term  SEARCH,  by analogy transferred from man to God, does not mean that the Spirit inquires to learn, but that He intimately knows. The language announces His perfect knowledge of the hidden counsels of God, and that the Spirit stands in the same relation to God that the soul of man does to man. The knowledge which the soul has of man's hidden purposes and resolutions is compared with the Spirit's knowledge of the secret purposes of God. For He is said (1) to know all things; (2) to know the deep things of God; (3) to have an intuitive knowledge with the precision and accuracy which the term  search  conveys; (4) to know them with the intimate knowledge with which a man knows his own counsels.</p>
      <p> With regard to the attribute of  OMNIPRESENCE  or immensity ascribed to the Holy Spirit, we find a vivid description of it in the psalm specially prepared to guide the Church's worship on this point: " Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit ? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence ?" (Ps. cxxxix. 7). The remark of the anonymous writer in the Greek  CATENA</p>
      
      <p> on this psalm, that His Spirit intimates the Holy Spirit, and His face the only-begotten Son, is not without probability. 1 But the evidence of the Spirit's omnipresence is put beyond all doubt. And when we trace the Spirit's presence as the inhabitant and guide of the believing soul, and of the Christian Church in all lands at one and the same moment, it is evident that He is as truly omnipresent in essence as He is omniscient in knowledge. For a mere creature cannot be in two places at once, or act, at the same moment, in a great variety of ways in many lands. The attempt of the Socinians to blunt the force of this consideration by referring to Satan plucking away the seed sown in the heart of many hearers of the gospel, is not analogous, because it involves a multitude of evil spirits, and successive, not simultaneous action. To the other attributes we need not advert.</p>
      <p> 3. As to  DIVINE WORSHIP  paid to the Spirit, it is found in various religious exercises. It is the more necessary to put this matter in the proper light, because Arminian writers, with the concession too readily evinced by them, were in the habit of asserting, along with those who denied the doctrine of the Spirit, that we have neither example nor command in Scripture for the worship of the Spirit. That statement is groundless. Why it is not more frequently mentioned may, without difficulty, be ascertained. One reason why the Spirit is not more directly, as well as more frequently, addressed in prayer, is, that He is  THE PROMPTER OF PRAYER, and because no one can pray without the surrender of the heart to Him, and without full dependence on His help (Eom. viii. 26), who moulds within us the prayer which the Son presents. But it is not true, in point of fact, that there is no example of prayer to the Spirit. Of the texts which fully evince it, let me adduce the ordinance of baptism per formed in the name of the Holy Ghost. We have only to</p>
      <p> 1  He Uses   the  words :     re   TvttJux  aurou  Ifncri   rt  a-)-iot   fnvfid,    TTfiffvirai   Js    ret</p>
      
      <p> consider the nature of the ordinance to perceive in it a solemn act of worship, an expression of faith, a testimony that He in whose name it is performed is our God, with a heartfelt surrender to Him in an act of new obedience. That all this is involved in it is clear from the words: " Were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" (1 Cor. i. 13). That these three Persons cannot be put in any other category than entire equality, is obvious from the fact that if any one of them were not God, two irreconcilable opposites would equally be the object of our faith, which is impossible.</p>
      <p> Another proof of the same thing is the invocation of grace from the Spirit, as well as from the Father and from Christ (Eev. i. 4). The words used are: " the seven Spirits which are before His throne;" but the allusion is not to created spirits, but to the one Spirit of God, described in the plural by the number  SEVEN,  to show the perfection of the gifts, or to point out their sufficiency for the Church's necessity and duties. That the reference is to the Spirit is clear, because Christ is said to " have the seven Spirits of God" (Eev. iii. 1) ; and there is no subordination in point of essential glory when He is equally invoked as the fountain of divine communications.</p>
      <p> Another consideration evincing the  DIVINE HONOUR  to be paid to Him is derived from the declaration that the sin against the Holy Ghost can never be forgiven. On the one hand, that could not be affirmed if He were not God; and, on the other hand, it by no means implies a superi ority to the other Persons from whom He is sent. It is to be explained by the nature of the sin which rejects the testimony, or quenches the operations of the Spirit, by w r hich alone men can be saved. The Holy Spirit is never represented as a worshipper, but always as the object of divine worship.</p>
      <p> 4.  THE CO-ORDINATE RANK  in which the Spirit is placed with the Father and the Son, is brought out in not a few</p>
      <p> H</p>
      
      <p> descriptive passages. We find them holding a co-ordinate rank when we look at Christ's baptism (Matt. iii. 16), or at the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit (Acts ii. 33), or at the fact that by Christ we have access in one Spirit to the Father (Eph. ii. 18). Without expounding all these passages, and others in this connection, let me adduce the apostolic benediction: "  THE GRACE  of the Lord Jesus Christ, and  THE LOVE OF GOD, AND THE COMMUNION  [communication]  OF THE HOLY GHOST  be with you all" (2 Cor. xiii. 14); words containing an invocation to all the persons of the God head, and in point of import tantamount to saying: " 0 Lord Jesus Christ, let Thy grace; 0 Father, let Thy love ; O Holy Ghost, let the communication of Thyself be with them all."</p>
      <p> 5. The name of  GOD  is indirectly given to the Spirit. In the early centuries, the opponents of the doctrine of the Spirit were wont to challenge the orthodox Church, asking, Where is the Spirit designated God ? Dr. Samuel Clarke was in the habit of affirming, according to his Arian bias, that the Holy Ghost is never spoken of as God either in the Old or New Testament. The language they desiderate may not be found in the express form which they desire. But we find an ample use of divine names applied to the Holy Spirit; and when we compare one passage with another, and with the connections of the context in which they stand, no possible doubt can remain on an unbiassed mind that the Spirit is supreme God, having a divine personality of the same kind with that of the Father and the Son, with whom He is named as of equal rank. It is happily remarked by Lampe: " It is befitting that  He who sjjcaks by all the prophets and apostles, as His scribes and amanuenses,  should speak less of Himself, when the work abundantly commends the author;" a just and happy observation, by no means to be neglected. But there are express instances where He who is called  THE HOLY GHOST  in one clause is called  GOD  in another. The narrative</p>
      
      <p> of Ananias and Sapphira is of such a character (Acts v. 3, 4). If Ananias lied to the Holy Ghost, and his culpability lay in the fact that he lied not to man, but to God, it is very evident that in Peter's account the Holy Ghost is God. (Compare similiar interchangeable phraseology in Ps. xcv. 7 and Heb. iii. 7.)</p>
      
      <p> THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT IX THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.</p>
      <p> O great thoughts confront us in reference to Christ throughout the Old and New Testament—(1) that He is a  DIVINE PERSON,  and (2)  THE ANOINTED SERVANT OF THE LORD.  On the one hand, the child born is designated and accepted by the Church as the "Wonderful, Counsellor,  THE MIGHTY GOD  (Isa. ix. 6); and, on the other hand, attention is turned to Him as the Servant of the Lord upon whom the Spirit has been put (Isa. xlii. 1). And these two thoughts, though distinctly apprehended, are never disjoined in Biblical theology.</p>
      <p> A twofold line of thought might here be pursued by us to show the constant agency of the Spirit on Christ's humanity. (1) The idea of man implies it (Gen. ii. 7); and (2) the great fact of the incarnation takes for granted that Christ's man hood was immediately filled and led by the Spirit. Many modern writers who deal with Christology, and write Lives of Jesus, are wont to describe the Redeemer in glowin^</p>
      <p> o   o</p>
      <p> language as a man replenished with an absolute fulness of the Spirit,—whatever meaning they may attach to that term, —but maintain for the most part an ominous silence on His higher nature and on His divine pre-existence as the second Person of the Trinity. But both thoughts must be combined.</p>
      <p> The passages which refer to the Spirit as anointing Christ are chiefly given historically. The teaching of the Baptist on the anointing of the Messiah is full of significance. It</p>
      <p> uc,</p>
      
      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHKIST.      11 7</p>
      <p> gives conclusive evidence that the Baptist by no means taught, according to the views largely adopted by writers of the Life of Jesus, that it was the absolute fulness and presence of the Spirit which constituted all the higher element that was in Christ, or that this was all that is involved in what is called His incarnation.</p>
      <p> It is worthy of notice that, prior to the mission of the Comforter to act with convincing power on the world, Scrip ture speaks of a mission of the Spirit conjoined with that of the Son. The Messiah is introduced by the prophet Isaiah saying: " And now the Lord God has sent me and His Spirit" (Isa. xlviii. 16) ; for, as Cocceius, Vitringa, and Lampe have conclusively proved, the words should be so translated. They bring before us a twofold or conjunct mission, which was appointed to take place together. They set forth that the Spirit of God had a part to act in and with the incar nation on the Person of the Messiah and in the whole performance of His mediatorial work. We need not refer again to the remarkable testimony of Isaiah to the anointing of Messiah by the Spirit.</p>
      <p> With regard to the incarnation, it was a conjunct act of the Trinity, in which the Spirit is represented as preparing the body which the Son assumed, by making it  His own  in a sense not to be affirmed of the other Persons of the Godhead. Here I would make one preliminary remark. The incarnation was among the category of  MEANS  to a given result, and introduced by occasion of sin, which it was intended to put away. Many among the scholastics repre sented the ultimate design of the incarnation as the self-manifestation of the Son of God, thus making it an object for Christ Himself, and sought for its own sake. But it is to think unworthily of God to make it  AN END.</p>
      <p> Such a notion destroys the grace of the incarnation, and too readily leads to the conclusion that it is of the nature of God to become incarnate. Not less active in the same</p>
      
      <p> 118     .   THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</p>
      <p> direction is the modern theory of  Dorner 1   and others, that the incarnation was included in the eternal idea of the world, irrespective of a fall. We cannot affirm that either the creation or incarnation was necessary, or that they were anything beyond a free result of God's will. Xo inner want was involved; it was only a self-moved act of love. That the incarnation is but a  MEANS  to au end, not an ultimate object in itself, is a position which must be held, if we would not open the way for that style of speculation to which we have just adverted. Nothing short of such means—for the incar nation was but a  means,  costly as it was—could suffice to bring about the end designed. The problem was, How could a guilty creature appear not guilty, and the partition-wall erected by sin on the one side and justice on the other, be abolished, that unimpeded love might flow forth, and man again be the temple of the Holy Ghost ? The end contem plated was, how every attribute of God could be magnified, all the persons of the Trinity equally honoured, and man's wants so fully met, that from the broken fragments of the first vessel another should be fashioned with still larger capacities of happiness and glory.</p>
      <p> For all His office the Lord Jesus received  THE UNCTION OF THE SPIRIT  : and here a question has been raised: Are we to refer this unction to the humanity of Christ or to the Person ? Theodoret, who too much betrays a Nestorian bias, limited the unction to the humanity alone. 2  On the other hand, Justin Martyr and Ambrose, not to mention others, refer the expression UNCTION to the Deity of our Lord. Others, whom Petavius adduces, refer it to both natures. Unquestionably, wherever allusion is made to this unction, it must be under stood as referring to the Person. The opinion that limits the unction to His humanity originated from the circumstance</p>

      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.      119</p>
      <p> that the propounders of that view concluded—as was by no means unnatural—that the expression could have no further allusion than to the sanctification of our Lord's humanity at His nativity and baptism ; and they did not duly attend to the wider acceptation of the phrase in Scripture. The mode in which the Redeemer subsequently to His exaltation received the promise of the Holy Ghost, together with the power of dispensing such a gift to others, is of such a nature, however, as conclusively proves that the unction is competent to Him only as God-man  l —that is, in both natures. As the humanity was assumed into the hypostatic union, we may fitly say, on the one hand, that  THE PERSON OF CHRIST  was anointed, so far as  THE CALL TO OFFICE  was concerned ; while we bear in mind, on the other hand, that it is the humanity that is anointed in as far as we contemplate the actual sup plies of gifts and graces, aids and endowments, necessary for the execution of His office.</p>
      <p> The unction to which we have referred did riot preclude, but presuppose the knowledge of divine things involved in Christ's pre-existence, and His divine fellowship with the Father before the world was. That was not an ideal, but a real pre-exist ence, and included an immediate intuitive knowledge of divine things. The Lord Jesus affirmed of Himself such things as are not competent to any finite being when He said: " No man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven " (John iii. 13). As our Lord existed from eternity, and as an intimate relation obtained between Him and the Father before the foundation of the world, His knowledge of divine things was intuitive and absolutely perfect to such an extent that He could say: " We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen " (John iii. 11). He refers to Himself as participant of the divine</p>
      <p> 1  Maestriclit puts it happily thus: " Proinde unctus est quoad  utramque naturam, quatenus unctio designat  vocationem;  sed quoad  humanam  tantuin, quatenus notat  qualificationem  "  (Theor, Pract. Theol.  p. 426).</p>
      
      <p> counsels, and as being in heaven before He came down to earth. And the additional clause: " the Son of man who is in heaven,"—which is not only genuine, but essential to the sense,—describes, in contrast with the clause: " no man ascended up to heaven," the sense in which He affirmed that He testified what He had seen. With the omnipresence of the divine nature He was in heaven while He spoke these words on the earth; for we must by no means translate the words (6  wv) "  who  WAS  in heaven," but " who is in heaven."</p>
      <p> The remark of Owen is worthy of deep consideration. " The only singular immediate act," says he, 1  " of the Person of the Son on the human nature, was the assumption of it into subsistence with Himself." That mode of contemplating the Person of Christ is Biblical. But that we may not be ingulfed in one-sidedness, it must be added that the Spirit, according to the order of the Trinity, interposes His power only to execute the will of the Son. 2  And so far is this from interfering with the glory of the Son, that it rather reveals Him more conspicuously, that in the work of redemp tion the operations of the Spirit are next in order to those of the Son.</p>
      <p> The two natures of our Lord actively concurred in every mediatorial act. If He assumed human nature in the true and proper sense of the term into union with His divine per son, that position must be maintained. The Socinian objection, that there could be no further need for the Spirit's agency, and, in fact, no room for it,—if the divine nature of our Lord was itself active in the whole range of Christ's mediation,—is meant to perplex the question, because these men deny the existence of any divine nature in Christ's person. That style of reasoning is futile ; for the question simply is, What do the Scriptures teach ? Do they affirm that  Christ was anointed ~by the Spirit  (Acts x. 38) ? that He was led out into the wilder-</p>

      <p> ness by the Spirit ? that He returned in the power of the Spirit to begin His public ministry ? that He performed His miracles by the Spirit ? and that, previously to His ascension, He gave commandments by the Spirit to the disciples whom He had chosen (Acts i. 2) ? No warrant exists for anything akin to the depotentiation - theory which denudes Him of essential attributes, and puts His humanity on a mere level with that of other men; and as little warrant exists for denying the Spirit's work on Christ's humanity in every mediatorial act, which He performed on earth or performs in heaven.</p>
      <p> The unction of the Spirit must be traced in all His personal and official gifts. In Christ the Person and office coincided. In His divine Person He was the substance of all the offices to which He was appointed and fitted by the Holy Spirit to discharge. The offices would be nothing apart from Himself, and could have neither coherence nor validity without the underlying Person. But He was also anointed with the Spirit, nay, the absolute receiver of the Spirit, poured on Him in such a plenitude that it was not by measure (John iii. 34).</p>
      <p> As to the  UNCTION  of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit, it was different according to the  THREE GRADES  successively imparted. The  first  grade was at the incarnation; the  second  coincided with His baptism; the  third  and  hiyhest  grade was at the ascension, when He sat down on His mediatorial throne and received from the Father the gift of the Holy Ghost to bestow upon His Church in abundant measure.</p>
      <p> I. The first grade of this anointing with the Spirit took place at the incarnation or nativity. The words, as given by Luke, contain a brief description of the supernatural concep tion : " The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God " (Luke i. 35). And they show that the Lord's humanity was sinless, and that it never was in Adam's covenant. The</p>
      
      <p> second clause describes more fully what was said in the first clause, according to the exegetical rule, that in corresponding members of this sort the darker is to be explained by the clearer. The import of both clauses is, that the Holy Spirit was the former of Christ's human nature ; and that the Son, by assuming it into personal union, made it His own by a right peculiar to Himself—that is, by a union personal and incommunicable to the other Persons of the Godhead. 1 And these words are important as serving to refute the ancient and recent Errorists, who disliked the idea that our Lord's flesh was formed by the Spirit from Mary's substance, and fancied to themselves a certain heavenly flesh brought with Him from above.</p>
      <p> Another point demanding notice is the statement that the holy thing born of Mary should be called  THE SON  OF  GOD. In construing this clause, we must make " the holy thing born of thee " the nominative of the sentence, and " shall be called Son of God " the predicate. They who 2  put the adjective HOLY  as the predicate thus: " that which is to be born shall be called holy," not only misapprehend the grammatical con struction, but eliminate the truth which the clause was in tended to convey. The true meaning is: the holy thing born of thee shall, in virtue of the hypostatic union, be also called the Son of God, thus asserting the unity of the Person. The words  (Sto  «at) intimate that there is both an eternal generation and a holy thing begotten, created when assumed, and assumed when created, and that the result is not two Persons, but one; for the holy thing to which Mary gave birth is  ALSO  called the Son of God.</p>
      <p> 1   It was united to Him in such a sense that it  alto  (*«&lt;) is the Son of God. That holy thing began to be at the conception by the Spirit.    The words  of thee  (i*  fou),  deleted by many in the phrase, should probably be retained in the text, for they are found in such a number of Fathers—(Justin, Irenaeus, Tertullian,   Cyprian, Athanasius, Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Jerome)—that the balance of  authority from this source  alone  goes far to counterbalance the evidence of faulty manuscripts against them.</p>
      <p> 2   So Bornemann and the revised version incorrectly.</p>
      
      <p> This explanation meets the argument of the Unitarians, whose plea, derived from this verse, is, that the future tense, " shall be called," implies that Christ was not the Son of God by eternal pre-existence, and that He only began to be the Son of God when He took the flesh; thus confounding the differ ence between His eternal Sonship and His being called so in the knowledge and confession of the Church—that is, the dif ference between being and manifestation. The nativity by the Holy Spirit from the Virgin could not make humanity the Son of God. As the humanity, however, was assumed into personal union by the Son, it also is called the Son of God. Everything included in the Spirit's work on Christ's humanity is of the last importance. Thus it is abundantly evident from Scripture— unless we give an arbitrary meaning to the phrase : " The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee" (Luke i. 35)—that the Lord's humanity was produced by the Holy Ghost in a supernatural way, which at once obviated  the possibility of contracting guilt from Adam, or of deriving any transmitted corruption, and which, by an act of infinite wisdom and power, put Him within the human family as a kinsman-Eedeemer, and yet exempted Him from being in Adam's covenant; for He was the second Adam, the Son of man.</p>
      <p> Nor did the mother need an immaculate nature. The question, How could pure humanity be derived from a defiled source which uniformly entails corruption on others ? is a difficulty which has staggered many—the Valentinians, the Anabaptists, the Quakers, and some modern Plymouthists on the one side, and the entire Church of Home on the other. The sects above named attempted to meet the difficulty by repre senting Mary as but a pipe or channel  (o-wXijv')  through which a heavenly body or flesh, immediately created by the Holy Ghost, but not formed from her substance, was introduced into the world. But on that principle the Lord Jesus would belong to another order of beings, and would not be our</p>
      
      <p> Li-other, born into our family (Heb. ii. 14). And redemption was only possible when effected by a  GOEL  or kinsman-Ifedeemer. As to the way in which the Eomish Church met the difficulty in her last Council, the presupposition (or, as theologians express it, the  Trp&amp;rov  -v^eOSo?) from which she started can be no other than the repetition of the exaggerated theory of Flacius on the subject of original sin, from which the entire Protestant Church, Lutheran and Reformed, re coiled with equal horror—viz. that sin had become the very essence of man. The divines who confuted Flacius at once saw that on such a supposition an incarnation would have been impossible, and replied that human nature, corrupted as it was by the sin of Adam, was still, as a work of God, good, and capable of redemption; that we can distinguish in idea between the good work of God and the vitiating taint super induced upon it, though \ve cannot separate these elements; and that God can do both—redeem His creature, and sepa rate the sin. On the ground of this distinction, which is pre supposed in the whole redeeming and regenerating grace of God, nature could be made available as the substance out of which, by the miraculous intervention of the Holy Ghost, the sinless humanity of our Lord could be produced. The theory of Rome makes a sinless mother indispensable; and it is as faulty as that of the above-named sects, which resorted in their perplexity to the conclusion that Mary was but a medium of transmission. If both these tendencies egregiously fail by regarding original sin as an insuperable difficulty to the sup position that our Lord derived His flesh from a fallen mother, Schleiermacher and his school, from antagonism to the super natural in miracle, place themselves on a Pelagian view of humanity, and concede that there was nothing more than the ordinary generation. As to the theory of Menken and Irving, that our Lord took fallen humanity, it wholly mistakes the great end of the supernatural conception. According to the first promise given in Genesis (iii. 15), and announced by</p>
      
      <p> Isaiah a second time, the Saviour was to be born of a virgin (Isa. vii. 14). The Holy Spirit was upon Him, accordingly, from the moment of His conception, displaying His power in supplying Him with the endowments, capacities, and gifts— physical, intellectual, and spiritual—which were necessary for His high work. As sanctification belongs to the Spirit's operations, there can be no doubt that everything required for the sanctification of the Lord's humanity was plentifully sup plied by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who warded off every taint from whatever quarter it could possibly approach Him. Not only so ; the soul of Christ, from the first moment of con scious existence, was filled with actual communications of the Spirit for such exercises of trust, and love, and holy affections as were necessary in the experience of Him who came as the second Adam, with the image of God restored in all its fulness (Ps. xxii. 10). He who made man a temple of God at first, and who was restoring it in the Incarnate Son, was incessantly active in conferring every conceivable gift, and in signally augmenting these gifts in ever-increasing measure at successive stages for the great work to be performed. All this was for His private life.</p>
      <p> "  And the child grew and waxed strong in Spirit ('jrvev^ari}}, filled with wisdom"  (Luke ii. 40). This passage proves that we must ascribe to the Spirit all the progress in Christ's mental and spiritual development, and all His advancement in knowledge and holiness. He went through the successive stages of acquirement in a manner absolutely unique, because His humanity had its existence in the personal union. He was filled by the Spirit with a wisdom which replenished all the powers of His rational nature. Though the increase, at first sight, seems incompatible with His being the Son of God, yet perfection is compatible with progress in a created nature, and He must needs be made like to His brethren. He knew as a boy what He had not acquired as a child; and as all the</p>
      <p> 1  This reading has a preponderance of authority  in  its favour.</p>
      
      <p> gifts were supplied to Him by the Spirit, we can trace the following stages which come to light in our Lord's history. The Spirit was given to Him, in consequence of the personal union, in a measure which no mere man could possess, con stituting the link between the Deity and humanity, perpetu ally imparting the full consciousness of His personality, and making Him inwardly aware of His divine Sonship at all times (Luke ii. 49).</p>
      <p> Thus the Spirit at the incarnation became the great guiding principle of all Christ's earthly history, according to the order of operation that belongs to the Trinity. It was the Holy Spirit that formed His human nature and directed the tenor of His earthly life. His human nature had no distinct per sonality, nor any self-directing principle  (TO  ^ye/zoi^/coz/), apart from the personal union; and as He was not less perfect, but more perfect than any other of the family of man on this account, it must be carefully remembered that the full con sciousness that He was the only Son of God, who came from God and went to God (John xiii. 3), flowed perpetually from the Spirit.  The communication from the one nature to the other was ~by the Spirit,  the  EXECUTIVE  of all the works of God. Hence He never spoke or acted but at the proper time (John vii. 6). He had His hour for everything that He per formed, and a full consciousness derived from the Spirit that He was the Son of God. The Godhead dwelling in Him made all due communications to His manhood by the Holy Ghost. All the evangelists, but especially the Gospel of John, show that the Spirit prompted all His actions, and gave direction to all His words. Nothing was undertaken but by the Spirit's direction; nothing spoken but by His guidance; nothing executed but by His power. This anointing with the Spirit, foretold in prophecy and accomplished in fact, may be traced in all His official words and deeds. The personal life of Christ as the God-man full of the Spirit, was the natural basis of all His official activity.</p>
      
      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.      127</p>
      <p> II.  THE SECOND GRADE  of the donation or unction of the Holy Spirit was at His  BAPTISM.  Before Jesus appeared invested with His  PUBLIC OFFICE,  the Holy Spirit had formed the human nature, and replenished it with perfect wisdom and faultless holiness; and the baptism,  AS THE PUBLIC IN AUGURATION  of the Lord Jesus  INTO  His  OFFICE,  was the occasion of conferring the supernatural gifts which had been promised in Old Testament prophecy. The evidence of His inauguration was furnished by the Baptist, the voice crying in the wilderness,—that is, the voice of the law and the prophets,—and by the visible descent of the Holy Spirit. The Baptist had a divine revelation that the Messiah should be pointed out to him by the visible descent of the Holy Spirit resting and abiding upon Him (John i. 33). If he supposed that the Messiah should appear after the stern and vehement manner in which the Old Testament prophets pre sented themselves, he was to learn that God had chosen another way. The Messiah came among others to be bap tized, and when He was baptized, the Spirit, like a dove, the emblem of gentleness, purity, and love, descended upon Him from the open heaven, and rested or abode upon Him.</p>
      <p> This descent of the Spirit was intended to confirm and encourage the Lord Jesus before entering on His arduous work; and it took place in that public concourse of people which assembled to hear the Baptist, and became the occasion of His public introduction into office. On this august occa sion all the Persons of the Trinity were distinctly manifested —the Father revealing Himself by an audible voice, the Son appearing in the flesh which He assumed, the Holy Spirit descending in a bodily shape like a dove. The anointer was the Father, the anointed was the Son, the unction, or anointing oil (Ps. xlv. 7), was the Holy Ghost, a divine Person of equal rank. It was not beneath the dignity of the Holy Spirit at the inauguration of the Messiah—whose office implies the reception of the Spirit not by measure (John iii. 34), and</p>
      
      <p> the dignity of receiving authority to dispense that Spirit to others—to make use of that visible emblem to accredit the great fact, and to bear testimony to it. Enough for us that it occurred. We are not warranted in the case of every Biblical narrative to demand an answer to the question, Why was this ? The abiding of the dove on Jesus, or the appearance of a dove, indicated that the Spirit of the Lord now  RESTED  upon Him (Isa. xi. 2). To the same purpose Peter said : " God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power" (Acts x. 38).</p>
      <p> Thus the unction for the office of  MESSIAH  or  CHRIST  is seen in the sinless nature and endowments of every kind that qualified Him for His task (Isa. xlii. 1-4, xlix. 1, 2). The full supply of the Spirit with which the Son was replenished from His nativity, was shadowed forth by many anointings instituted in the typical services of Israel, especially in the appointments to the three principal functions—prophet, priest, and king (Isa. Ixi. 1 ; Ps. xlv. 8). There was, in the Lord's human life, a combination of all the graces that seem the most opposite,—meekness and boldness, the assertion of truth and deep humility, greatness and gentleness,—nay, the scat tered beauties of all the saints jointly found in Him. The expression: " the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus," unfolds to us the source of all His actions, and demonstrates that more habitual grace dwelt in Him than in all created beings. The Baptist therefore declared: " God giveth not the Spirit by measure to Him" (John iii. 34); for though the words "to Him" are not in the original Greek, they are undoubtedly implied, as will appear from the following reasons :—(1) The passage cannot be generalized into an allusion that shall take in the Church. It is a very forced interpretation that would refer it to the general outpouring of the Spirit on the Church, —a comment for which the context supplies no warrant. Moreover, (2) the expression  GIVETH THE SPIRIT,  in the present tense, is there used in connection with the fact, and</p>
      
      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.      129</p>
      <p> is the reason of the fact, that Jesus " speaketh the words of God," but is not in connection with the authority subse quently conferred of giving the Spirit to others.</p>
      <p> If it is asked: "What need had He of the divine teaching of the Holy Spirit when He had known the heavenly Father from eternity ? the answer is: The Son of God, as such, needed no further teaching as to divine things. But as it behoved Him to be man, to be made like to His brethren, and to occupy the servant's place as the one Mediator between God and man, He  NEEDED THAT UNCTION  with which He was supplied. The Socinians, who will have it that whatever higher knowledge of divine things was in Jesus was obtained at His baptism, put the two statements in antagonism to each other. But they are in perfect harmony.</p>
      <p> That unction with the Spirit which preceded Christ's mira culous activity when He began to go about doing good, was bestowed on the occasion when He came to receive baptism, and to be publicly inaugurated into His Messianic office. The Spirit descended upon Him and abode on Him in such fulness that He could communicate His miraculous power to His friends, which no mere prophet could ever perform (John i. 33 ; Matt. iii. 11). He was anointed to be the supreme Prophet (Matt. xvi. 2 0); * and as the prophets had immediate revelations when the Spirit of God came upon them, the same thing held true of Him, but with this marked pecu liarity, that the Spirit did not occasionally reveal the will of God as in their case, but evermore permanently dwelt in Him to reveal the divine mind, and make Him conscious of His own Sonship.</p>
      <p> The visible descent of the Holy Spirit, not only for the sake of the Jews and of the Baptist, but for a testimony to Christ Himself (Matt. iii. 16), took place while Jesus was praying to the Father, probably with a view to obtain the Spirit, which had long before been promised by the prophets (Luke iii. 21).</p>
      
      <p> As to the object designed to be served by the descent of the Holy Spirit, it showed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah promised to the Fathers, and that He was filled with the Spirit, which, on the one hand, would fit Him for the execution of  His high office;  and, on the other hand,  enable Him, when His work was accomplished, to disjjcnse the Spirit to His people without let or hindrance; for the Spirit is the efficient cause of all His divine operations outward to the Church and to the world. The operations of the Son of God upon His human nature were effected by the Holy Spirit, as the immediate efficient cause of its existence, and of its fitness for the accomplishment of the great work for which the Son of God had assumed human nature.</p>
      <p> The Spirit given at the baptism was intended to equip Him for the execution of His mediatorial office, as Prophet, Priest, and King. That the Spirit qualified Him for His prophetic priestly and kingly offices is evident, because, with a full consciousness of His divine Sonship perpetually awakened and sustained by the Holy Spirit, He (1) not only spoke the words of God, but (2) offered Himself without spot to God, and (3) draws all His people to Himself by the constant aid of the eternal Spirit.</p>
      <p> Is it strange that He should be under the guidance of the Spirit which He gives to others ? Tin's will not appear strange when we call to mind that lie was man, and that His human nature without a separate personality of its own had its activity only in personal union with the Son of God, who, though neither depotentiated, nor holding any of His divine perfections in abeyance,  acted on the human nature,  in every mediatorial act,  ly the power of the Holy Spirit.  The divine nature did not absorb the human nature in any of its functions. Both natures were perfectly distinct, but united in the one Person. The light of Christ's understanding, the holy purity and the unswerving obedience of His will, the exercise of all His faculties and powers in religious things,</p>
      
      <p> were due to the immediate guidance of the Holy Spirit of God, giving Him the full consciousness that He was the eternal Son, and authority to act as such.</p>
      <p> The next fact in Christ's life was  THE TEMPTATION,  of which it is said that He was  led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted  (Matt. iv. 1). The human nature was confirmed by the Spirit, and made victorious at every point of assault by the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> And when the temptation was ended, it is said: " Jesus returned  in the poiver of the Spirit  into Galilee" (Luke iv. 14), to begin a ministry of power. Coming from the scenes of the temptation with a victory which gave Him the right of con quest, He, with an absolute plenitude of the Spirit, began to call disciples to Him, partly as trophies of His victory, partly as office-bearers in the kingdom which He was warranted to erect on the ruins of Satan's kingdom, which had already sustained a reverse. Every converted soul was a new prey taken from the adversary by the  HOLY SPIRIT,  on the ground of the meritorious obedience, which was accepted as perfect, at the point where the battle was lost by the first man. Jesus had authority to take the first steps for setting up His kingdom.</p>
      <p> Another memorable fact was the sermon preached in the synagogue of Nazareth, where He was well known (Luke iv. 17). Having read the words of the prophet Isaiah, which are expressly put into the mouth of the Messiah,—" The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach " (Isa. Ixi. 1),—He expounded it, and added: " This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears." The doctrines which He uttered exhibited the unction to which the pro phecy referred, and His townsmen wondered at the  gracious words  (rot?  XOYCW TT}?  ^ap/ro?) which proceeded out of His mouth, as He spoke by the Spirit which anointed Him.</p>
      <p> The next fact which discovers that He acted by the Spirit, was the  CASTING OUT OF SATAN.  " If I cast out devils  BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD,  then the kingdom of God is come to you"</p>
      
      <p> (Matt. xii. 28). The Lord Jesus was then face to face with Satan's kingdom, and was setting up the kingdom of God. This was not the general dominion over the world. It was that kingdom referred to in the first promise, where it was said that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. By the Spirit of God which rested on Him, He was able to work miracles in general, and to cast out Satan in particular from his fortress in the human heart; thus show ing an authority and a miraculous power which sufficiently attested that the King of a new kingdom was on the scene, and had begun His sway over those who are born of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit was for a time shut up and limited to Christ's own Person. But when the atonement was con summated, the life-principle of His own Person was also to be that of His kingdom.</p>
      <p> I next refer to the Spirit's work in connection with Christ's priestly oblation : "  Wlto, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God"  (Heb. ix. 14). The expression: '•' the eternal Spirit," can only mean the Holy Spirit according to the usual acceptation of the term,—not the divine nature of Christ, as too many expositors have understood it. The meaning is, that the Son of God, moved and animated by the Holy Ghost, offered Himself without spot as an atoning sacrifice. The Spirit rendered Him an unspotted sacrifice. The Spirit discovered to Him the inflexible claims of God as well as inflamed Him with such love to man and zeal for God as prompted Him to go forward in spite of every hindrance, pain, and difficulty, to effect the world's redemp tion, and thus fitted Him as man for His work. The Holy Spirit, in a word, filled His mind with the unflagging ardour, zeal, and love which led Him to complete the sacrifice.</p>
      <p> To explain the text as if it described the divine nature as priest and the human nature as the sacrifice, is inadmissible. The  WHOLE PERSON  is priest and victim; for all done by either nature belongs to the Person :  HE  offered  HIMSELF,</p>
      
      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.      133</p>
      <p> says the apostle. In this view of the matter, it would be a mere tautology—if the eternal Spirit is interpreted of the divine nature—to say He offered Himself through the divine nature. It would on that principle be but a repetition of the same thing. If we take it, however, as intimating the action of the Holy Spirit, it will vividly represent the holy fire by which the sacrifices were consumed. One does not find, except on this interpretation, anything in the sacrifice of Christ that could be adduced as the antitype of the holy fire employed in the sacrifice. Nor are the objections to the view which we have propounded of any weight. When it is objected that the Holy Spirit was not the Priest who offered the sacrifice, the obvious answer is that Christ as Priest offered Himself a sacrifice possessed of infinite value and excellence in consideration of His divine Person, and of the additional fact that it was unspotted and offered through the Holy Spirit. Because the Spirit was in Him as a Spirit of faith and zeal and love, the Eedeemer took upon Him with the utmost alacrity all that was to be performed and endured for man's redemption.</p>
      <p> The Holy Spirit, which framed the Redeemer's mind as well as body, perpetually rested upon Him during all His earthly sojourn, imparting to Him the full consciousness of His Sonship in the highest sense, and prompting Him to execute the mediatorial work imposed on Him (Isa. xlii. 1-4). That our Saviour was also raised from the dead by the Holy Ghost, is clearly taught by Peter, when he affirms that He was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit (1 Pet. iii. 18).</p>
      <p> III. The  THIRD DEGREE  of Christ's unction, reserved for His exaltation, is thus described : " Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and  having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost,  He hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear" (Acts ii. 33). This third</p>
      
      <p> degree of unction to which reference is made in the Psalms (Ps. ii. G, xlv. 7), and which became apparent at Pentecost, was an ascension-gift, the description of which by Peter is but a paraphrase of the words : " Thou hast ascended on high; Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts for men" (Ps. Ixviii. 18). That supply of the Spirit was meant for the Church to be erected and organized; and it was fitly bestowed after the ascension on those for whom the Spirit was purchased as well as destined.</p>
      <p> When we follow the sequence of events on the day of Pentecost, we see the Spirit acting in a twofold way—as the Spirit of conviction and as the Spirit of adoption. lie  con • vinccd  the multitude  of their sin  and guilt, that they might seek repentance and forgiveness. To minds penitent and receiving baptism for the remission of sins, lie was further promised as the Spirit of adoption: " Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts ii. 38). The order of salvation is repentance, forgiveness, and then the inhabitation of the Holy Ghost as the Spirit of adoption.</p>
      <p> We are brought to the  ACTUAL MISSION  of the Comforter. Previous to His resurrection Christ had been the receiver of the Spirit, and the Spirit was mainly limited to Christ's own Person. With His resurrection the day came when He showed that the great result of His atoning death was the power of bestowing the Spirit upon others, a blessing so momentous that it may be described as that in which all other blessings are included. This is the grandest display of Christ's exaltation—the culminating point,—arguing at once reward and divine dignity. Fur no mere servant could occupy the position of conferring upon others the gift of the Spirit, who is a divine Person. He only who had put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and who had the Spirit to bestow, could exercise the authority of sending Him. The Spirit was given by the risen Christ to equip His ministers and to be the all-directing as well as sanctifying power in</p>
      
      <p> WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST.      135</p>
      <p> the kingdom of heaven which was now set up, as had been expressly promised by the Old Testament prophets and by the Lord Himself (Ps. Ixviii. 19 ; John xiv. 16).</p>
      <p> As Mediator, the Lord Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit for the execution of all His offices and for the per formance of all His work. The  RIGHT TO SEND THE SPIRIT into the hearts of fallen men was acquired by atonement. Many, indeed, had been saved in virtue of His covenant engagement from the day of the first promise. The opera tions of the Spirit in every epoch presuppose the vicarious sacrifice, on which depends the right of giving the Holy Spirit in any case : " He redeemed us that  ("vaj  we might receive the promise of the Spirit by faith " (Gal. iii. 14). The promised Spirit followed the cancelling of the curse as the effect the cause. Countless multitudes had been saved on the ground of the coming sacrifice, but the precision of the language which connects the gift of the Spirit with the finished work of Christ is never forgotten, and the Holy Spirit was never spoken of as  SENT  while the old economy stood.</p>
      <p> The Holy Ghost, supplying His humanity with light and strength for His mediatorial work, was, according to the divine order, only carrying out the will of the Son, and interposing His power to execute the intimations of the Son. The Spirit's operations revealed the will and purpose of the Son.</p>
      <p> The  WORKING OF MIRACLES  was also from the Holy Spirit, though the authority flowed from Christ Himself. The Holy Spirit is described as acting in Christ's prophetical office in the same way as in the apostles and prophets. He per formed miracles: He showed that the kingdom of God was come. The distinction which Peter employs when he uses the expression: " anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power," may refer to both gifts—to the sanctifying as well as to the miraculous works (Acts x. 38).</p>
      
      <p> From the statements referring to Christ's unction for all His offices, it sometimes appears as if He were in the sub ordinate position of needing direction, aid, and miraculous power for the purposes of His mission; at other times He is said to  GIVE THE SPIRIT  and to  SEND THE SPIRIT,  as if the Spirit's operations were subordinated to the Son. It is, however, evident from the whole tenor of Scripture that there was a conjoined mission in which the Son and Spirit acted together for man's restoration, according to the order of operation in the Trinity.</p>
      
      <p> LECTUEE    III.</p>
      <p> THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN THE INSPIRATION OF PROPHETS AND APOSTLES.</p>
      <p> TN the Old and New Testament we find two kinds of gifts, -*-  dividing the community into two classes. We find (1) the ordinary saving gifts in the religious body, or people of God: (2) the extraordinary gifts for official service. The latter created duties rather than dignities; and the authority conferred on their possessors was only a further obligation. They were the necessary endowments for qualifying office bearers called to administer the covenant, and in whom God spoke (Heb. i. 1).</p>
      <p> It may be proper to show that they were gifts intended to fit men for office; that they were but temporary; and that they were conspicuously displayed, now here and now there.</p>
      <p> Extraordinary gifts were given from the earliest times to the recipients of the divine oracles, first to Moses, through whom the law was given, and then to the cycle of prophets who spoke the word of God to their own generation, or wrote it, by divine command, for all coming times. These gifts were intended to show men generally, that in receiving their word as a divine message, they were not misled by cunningly devised fables. The Spirit is referred to as the author of these supernatural gifts (Heb. ii. 4); and they ceased wjien no longer needed for the great end which they were intended to subserve.</p>
      
      <p> 1. As to prophecy, it was not, as some will have it, mere religious enthusiasm, or the exaltation of the religious senti ment. Though Abraham is called a prophet (Gen. xx. 7), and all by whom the Spirit uttered a divine communication, we find it was specially from the time of Samuel that a series of  PROPHETS,  with a commission supernaturally accredited, appeared in succession, down to the time of Malachi, to recall Israel to their law,—to reprove the nation's vices, to declare the divine judgments,—and to proclaim the greatest events in the world's history—the incarnation, atonement, and gracious reign of the Messiah. This gift of prophecy was the chief gift of Old Testament times; and an act of divine immediate intervention conveyed that gift to those who were invested with it.</p>
      <p> The Holy Spirit is referred to as  THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY in that very variously expounded passage of the Apocalypse : »} &lt;yap fiaprvpia rov  'I^crou e'crrt  TO  irvevpa  TJ}?  Trpcxfirjreia 1 ? : "  the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy " (llev. xix. 10); the meaning of which appears not so much in the order of the words given in the Authorized Version, as in their trans position, which the Greek warrants and the sense demands, thus: " the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus." ' The expression: " the Spirit of prophecy," according to the uniform nsage where a genitive follows the term Spirit, intimates that the Spirit spoke in all the prophets ; and the import of the clause is, that the scope or aim of all prophecy was to testify of Jesus (John xv. 2G, v. 39).</p>
      <p> The nature of the Spirit's operation on the prophet's mind is explained by Peter when he thus declares, in full harmony with all that the historic outline of the Old Testament narrative contains: " No prophecy of the Scripture was of any private excitation (tVtXucrew*,); but holy men of God spoke as</p>
      <p> 1  See to this effect a dissertation by Stade, published under the auspices of Mosheim,  de Spiritn Prophetlae de Christo testante,  1734. The purport of the verse is thus put: " ita ego quo^ne jussus sum testeni Christ! agerc."</p>
      
      <p> they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Pet. i. 21). The antithesis intended to be conveyed by the two clauses is, no private impulse, but a moving influence of the Spirit. The allusion of the words, though variously interpreted, seems to be to the mission of the prophets, to the removal of the barriers or the opening of the lists when they started on their race ; for they ran only when the Spirit sent them (Jer. xxiii. 21). They remained silent till they received the Spirit's communi cation, or the unmistakable impulse of the Spirit (Jer. xx. 17); in other words, they did not start till the lists were opened, and they were told to run. The Spirit did not give them this gift as a permanent habit, or so much reserved wealth from which they could draw at their discretion. He gave them light and divine communications for the official purpose which all inspiration subserved at certain times, and so moved them that they could not but speak or write what the Spirit enjoined them to declare. The prophetic Spirit imparted a supernatural illumination in virtue of which they understood fully what they were commissioned to announce,— whether things past, present, or to come,—beyond the range of the unaided human faculties. As to the mode of communi cation to the human mind, whether given by dream, vision, or ecstasy, we should not attempt to scrutinize it, partly because we have had no experience of the thing, partly because our faculties are not commensurate to the task.</p>
      <p> 2. The supernatural gifts in the New Testament Church were very abundant, but all culminated in  THE APOSTLES,  who were the organs of Christ's revelation to the Church, and invested with an ecumenical commission which extended to all lands, and which endures through all time. The Church is built on the apostles, and will continue to stand on that foundation till the second advent. As to those supernatural gifts which the Spirit thus dispensed in the apostolic Churches in the most ample fulness, according to His will, even beyond the circle of the apostles, we find that to one He</p>
      
      <p> gave the gift of knowledge, to another the gift of healing, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, and the like. These gifts were limited to individuals, and not universal; they were temporary, so that one might possess them to-day and want them to-morrow; and they were by no means co-extensive with the possession of divine grace. That rich supply of supernatural or miraculous gifts with which the apostolic Churches were adorned, was a standing pledge and sign that the inward miracle of inspiration continued. The cessation of these gifts, after they had served their purpose, was a significant fact. But during the whole time of their continuance, these miraculous gifts, and especially the gift of tongues,—that is, the gift of speaking in languages which had never been learned,—were a conclusive proof and illustration of the miracle of inspiration.</p>
      <p> These extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were no longer needed when the canon of Scripture was closed. Up to that time they were an absolute necessity. They are now no longer so. Nor is the Church warranted to expect their restoration, or to desire prophetic visions, immediate revela tions, or miraculous gifts, either in public or in private, beyond, or besides, the all-perfect canon of Scripture. The Church of Home, which still claims these extraordinary gifts, is to that extent injurious to the Spirit as the author of Scripture. And enthusiastic sects  l   that cherish the belief of their restoration, or an expectation to that effect, have not learned or duly pondered how great a work of the Spirit has been completed and provided for the Church of all times in the gift of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
      <p> When they began to be abused for purposes of display on the one side, or envy on the other, they were put in a secondary place ; and a more excellent way presented to men's attention. Then the saving graces—faith, hope, love—were</p>
      <p> 1   E.rj.    The  Montanists  of the  second  century and  the  Irvingites  of the nineteenth century.</p>
      
      <p> so preferred as to eclipse the most imposing extraordinary gifts (1 Cor. xii. 31 ff.). The inestimable blessings of regene rating grace, and of true spiritual life, were set forth as of paramount value far beyond all the transitory gifts.</p>
      <p> The presence of miraculous gifts in both dispensations served a twofold purpose. They were (1) an indubitable proof of a supernatural revelation from God to man in general (Heb. ii. 4); (2) they were a reliable pledge as well as elucidation of the inward miracle of inspiration. The man who possessed them, that is, who was invested with what was in its own nature miraculous, and who gave evidence that he could at proper seasons reveal the future, was entitled with authority to say : " Thus saith the Lord."</p>
      <p> When it is alleged that the restoration of these gifts is not an unwarrantable expectation, the answer is, they are no longer required. The closing of the canon has superseded their necessity and value, inasmuch as the Church possesses in the Scriptures all that they were intended to accredit and commend. Beyond the written word which was completed before the apostles passed away, the Spirit has no further revelations or immediate communications of the divine will to impart. The extraordinary gifts, limited as they were to the primitive Church, wholly passed away, because they were no longer necessary.</p>
      <p> When it is argued that they have been lost by the Church's fault, and that they would be restored to the be lieving expectation of the Church,—if she had faith to wait for them in prayer,—the answer is, that the prophecy of Joel was fulfilled at Pentecost and during the apostolic age. To the allegation that these gifts ought still to be possessed, we reply by denying the supposition that the miraculous gifts were to continue. What would they accredit if the canon is closed ? Had they been intended as a part of the Church's chartered rights, they would not have been withheld for nearly two thousand years. The link with a miraculous past</p>
      
      <p> would have been kept up. But they had served their purpose.</p>
      <p> The proposition which I shall here endeavour to set forth and vindicate is the following :  The Holy Spirit supplied prophets and apostles, as chosen organs, with gifts which must be distinguished from ordinary grace, to give forth in human forms of speech a revelation which must be accepted as the word of God in its whole contents, and as the authoritative guide for doctrine and duty.</p>
      <p> This proposition I will now assert and elucidate. But let me at the outset obviate a difficulty as to the order in which we take up the question. It has been objected by certain writers that we reason in a circle here, first proving the truth of Scripture by its unerring inspiration, and then establishing inspiration by Scripture. It is not so. We proceed by a strictly inductive method. In the whole argu ment, which goes to establish the fact of a divine revelation as well as the genuineness, authenticity, and canonical autho rity of Scripture, nothing is assumed. We neither forestall historic proof nor dispense with rational evidence. All this is completed before the question of inspiration is even taken into consideration. It is only when these points have been conclusively proved and established that we interrogate the books committed to the Church as the oracles of God on the question of their higher origin. The evidence from  MIRACLES and  PROPHECY,  which accredits a divine commission, accredits also the inspiration to which the apostles laid claim.</p>
      <p> As to the credentials supplied by  MIRACLES,  wrought as they were by the same Spirit who is the Spirit of revelation and the Spirit of prophecy, it must be held that the miracles performed by Moses, by the prophets, and by the apostles, furnish undeniable evidence that they spoke and wrote by divine inspiration. It is a first principle to which no valid exception can be taken, that the Holy Spirit, the divine author of all miracles, will by no means give countenance to</p>
      
      <p> an impostor, or give a divine sanction to falsehood. The Deists and sceptics generally are so well aware of this, that they have left no means untried to invalidate this proof. As it would carry us away from our subject to enter into this topic at large, I shall only touch its salient point. Whether miracles prove a commission to reveal a divine message and the truth of the doctrine  IMMEDIATELY  or  MEDIATELY,  has been debated with much acuteness. I unhesitatingly attach myself to the view which asserts that miracles immediately prove the truth of the doctrine and the inspiration of the messenger.</p>
      <p> If, therefore, any one declared, as Moses and the prophets did in the Old Testament, and as Christ and His apostles in the New Testament, that he was divinely commissioned and performed miracles in attestation of his doctrine, the acceptance of their testimony with unhesitating confidence was only a compliance with divine authority. They were organs of a heaven-attested revelation, speaking and writing with divine inspiration; for God evidently spoke in them (Heb. i. 1). They who attempt, as many now attempt in a more open or more modified way, to expel the miracles from Scripture, are virtually endeavouring—whether they con sciously mean it or not—to make the writers false witnesses, and to undermine all certainty.</p>
      <p> Another test of not less validity than the former is the evidence derived from  PROPHECY,  which is  A MIRACLE OF KNOWLEDGE  as the other is of power. The great test of a true prophet was that the prediction came to pass (Deut. xviii. 22). As this test, however, could not be applied by his contemporaries, if the matter were remote, we find that those credentials which established him as a prophet of the Lord were based on the fulfilment of things which could be known by experience. In proof of this we have only to recall the predictions of Moses, Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha in reference to things near at hand, and verified before the eyes of their contemporaries. We have only to recall such</p>
      
      <p> near predictions as Micaiah's (1 Kings xxii. 28) or Isaiah's (Isa. vii. 4, xxxvii. 34) ; and when they were summoned to write, so vividly had all been presented to their minds, and so accurately had all been retained in their memory, that we find a Jeremiah, at the end of twenty years, making the selection of the matter and digesting it into form by the Spirit's guidance in a manner succinct enough to prevent the book from exceeding reasonable bounds, and we must clearly hold that thoughts and words were, as it were, fused and molten together or formed and shaped together (Jer. xxxvi. 32).</p>
      <p> As for the apostles in the New Testament, it is only necessary to recall their opportunities and the terms of their commission, to see that they were armed with historic information obtained in the Lord's immediate presence, and subsequently brought back, as occasion required, to their remembrance by the Holy Spirit, who also furnished the communication of new truths, which were supernaturally imparted as the necessities of the Church required. Their authority, accordingly, was the same with that of Christ, because He took all the responsibility of their official teaching upon Himself, when He said: " He that heareth you heareth me " (Matt. x. 40).</p>
      <p> It is important to keep in mind, that while the Holy Spirit is the author of supernatural revelation with all its accompaniments, adjuncts, and evidences, there are two aspects of the question—one  IN FACT  and one  IN WORD.  The former is the objective manifestation of the Son of God ; the latter is the written word prepared by men whom the Spirit specially called and endowed.  THE PERSONAL SELF-MANIFESTATION  preceded ; the  WRITTEN WORD  followed. The former conveyed the revelation to the minds of prophets and apostles; the latter conveyed it in appropriate terms from their minds to the Church at large, securing for it such a safe communication as became the oracles of God.</p>
      <p> 1  See  Studlen und Kritiktn  for 1861, H. 1.</p>
      
      <p> Both operations were from the Holy Spirit. Eevelation always existed  IN GREAT FACTS,  with an appended explanation in spoken or written words. In these facts we find the various attributes of God and the aspects of His moral government exhibited to the faith of the Church and for the enlargement of her knowledge. And  THE REVELATION OF WORD  showed how the facts answered this purpose. Eevelation of fact and revelation of word, emanating from one and the same Spirit of God, were conjoined from the beginning. From the time of the fall, the types and pro phecies—foreshadowing and predicting the great sacrifice— opened up a revelation of fact in due time to be accom plished, of which also a thousand deliverances in the history of the Church were the pledges. To this revelation of fact the patriarchs looked forward, just as we look back to the accomplished reality. In the New Testament the revelation is embodied in the historic facts of the incarnation, atone ment, and resurrection of Christ, and in the perfect narrative or record of these facts in the written word.</p>
      <p> Of this written revelation the Holy Spirit is the author. The fact that the personal Spirit not only conveyed the truth to the writer's mind, but found adequate expression for it, involved a certain limitation or abasement in con descending to speak in human forms of speech. We may not unfitly say that, as God is said to humble Himself to behold the things that are in the earth (Ps. cxiii. 6), and as the Son humbled Himself when He became obedient to death (Phil. ii. 8), so the Holy Spirit abases Himself in giving His message, however lofty the matter, in a form of speech, which often resembles a mother's accommodation to the capacity of an infant. And this was necessary in order that the written word might, without constraint or difficulty, pass into the articulate speech and the written language of every nation on the surface of the globe.</p>
      <p> I have referred to divine fact as underlying the inspired</p>
      <p> K</p>
      
      <p> word, because the principal argument at present urged against inspiration—as is well known to those who know German theology—is, that the revelation is not in the documents or in the written word at all. It is argued that the latter are mere literary productions, composed under the same conditions w r ith ordinary writings, or differing from them only in the circumstance that the writers were holier men ; and hence they have no reserve or fear in permitting any liberty to be taken with the Scriptures. They fall back on the fact. They say the revelation of fact is secure. This mediating theology, which took its rise from Schleiermacher, and has been represented on this point by Tholuck, Rothe, and the great body of German divines, allows a revelation in historic facts, but denies the Biblical revelation in any true accepta tion of the term. In a word, the historic revelation of fact is isolated from the book-Revelation. The books, according to them, are no more than any other narrative digested by pious men—mere literary productions having no supernatural origin whatever. The revelation, according to this theory, is not in the records at all, which, in fact, are correct and trust worthy just in proportion as the writers had access or had not to reliable information, and who are by no means supposed to be exempt from the infirmities, mistakes, and even moral obliquities into which men, acting from ordinary motives, are betrayed.</p>
