<h1 class="caption"> LIFE AND CHARACTER OF CHARNOCK</h1>
<p>
                                         BY WM. SYMINGTON, D.D.
</p>

<p>
     STEPHEN CHARNOCK, B.D., was born in the year 1628, in the parish of St. Katharine Cree, London.
His father, Mr. Richard Charnock, practised as a solicitor in the Court of Chancery, and was descended
from a family of some antiquity in Lancashire. Stephen, after a course of preparatory study, entered
himself, at an early period of life, a student in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was placed under
the immediate tuition of the celebrated Dr. William Sancroft, who became afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury. Although there is too much reason to fear that colleges seldom prove the spiritual birthplaces
of the youth that attend them, it was otherwise in this case. The Sovereign Spirit, who worketh where and
how he wills, had determined that this young man, while prosecuting his early studies, should undergo
that essential change of heart which, besides yielding an amount of personal comfort, could not fail to
exert a salutary influence on all his future inquiries, sanctify whatever learning he might hereafter acquire,
and fit him for being eminently useful to thousands of his fellow-creatures. To this all-important event we
may safely trace the eminence to which, both as a Preacher and as a Divine, he afterwards attained,—as
he had thus a stimulus to exertion, a motive to vigorous and unremitting application, which could not
otherwise have existed.
</p>
<p>
     On his leaving the University he spent some time in a private family, either as a preceptor or for the
purpose of qualifying himself the better for discharging the solemn and arduous duties of public life, on
which he was about to enter. Soon after this, just as the Civil War broke out in England, he commenced
his official labors as a minister of the gospel of peace, somewhere in Southwark. He does not appear to
have held this situation long; but short as was his ministry there, it was not altogether without fruit. He
who had made the student himself, while yet young, the subject of saving operations, was pleased also to
give efficacy to the first efforts of the youthful pastor to win souls to Christ. Several individuals in this his
first charge were led to own him as their spiritual father. Nor is this a solitary instance of the early
ministry of an individual receiving that countenance from on high which has been withheld from the
labors of his riper years. A circumstance this, full of encouragement to those who, in the days of youth,
are entering with much fear and trembling on service in the Lord’s vineyard. At the time when they may
feel impelled to exclaim with most vehemence, Who is sufficient for these things? God may cheer them
with practical confirmations of the truth, that their sufficiency is of God.
</p>
<p>
     In 1649, Charnock removed from Southwark to Oxford, where, through favor of the Parliamentary
Visitors, he obtained a fellowship in New College; and, not long afterwards, in consequence of his own
merits, was incorporated Master of Arts. His singular gifts, and unwearied exertions, so attracted the
notice and gained the approbation of the learned and pious members of the University, that, in 1652, he
was elevated to the dignity of Senior Proctor,—an office which he continued to hold till 1656, and the
duties of which he discharged in a way which brought equal honor to himself and benefit to the
community.
</p>
<p>
     When the period of his proctorship expired, he went to Ireland, where he resided in the family of Mr.
Henry Cromwell, who had been appointed by his father, the Protector, to the government of that country.
It is remarkable how many of the eminent divines, both of England and Scotland, have spent some part of
their time in Ireland, either as chaplains to the army or as refugees from persecuting bigotry. Charnock
seems to have gone thither in the capacity of chaplain to the Governor, an office which, in his case at
least, proved no sinecure. During his residence in Dublin, he appears to have exercised his ministry with
great regularity and zeal. He preached, we are told, every Lord’s day, with much acceptance, to an
audience composed of persons of different religious denominations, and of opposite grades in society. His
talents and worth attracted the members of other churches, and his connection with the family of the
Governor secured the attendance of persons of rank. By these his ministrations were greatly esteemed and
applauded; and it is hoped that to some of them they were also blessed. But even many who had no
respect for his piety, and who reaped no saving benefits from his preaching, were unable to withhold their
admiration of his learning and his gifts. Studying at once to be an “ensample to the flock,” and to “walk
within his house with a perfect heart,” his qualities, both public and private, his appearances, whether in
the pulpit or the domestic circle, commanded the esteem of all who were privileged to form his
acquaintance. It is understood that the honorary degree of Bachelor in Divinity, which he held, was the
gift of Trinity College, Dublin, conferred during his residence in that city.
</p>
<p>
     The restoration of Charles, in 1660, put an end to Charnock’s ministry in Ireland, and hindered his
resuming it elsewhere for a considerable time. That event, leading, as it could not but do, to the re-
establishment of arbitrary power, was followed, as a natural consequence, by the ejectment of many of the
most godly ministers that ever lived. Among these was the excellent individual of whom we are now
speaking. Accordingly, although on his return to England he took up his residence in London, he was not
permitted to hold any pastoral charge there. Nevertheless, he continued to prosecute his studies with
ardor, and occasionally exercised his gifts in a private way for fifteen years, during which time he paid
some visits to the continent, especially to France and Holland.
</p>
<p>
     At length, in 1675, when the restrictions of the government were so far relaxed, he accepted a call
from a congregation in Crosby Square, to become co-pastor with the Rev. Thomas Watson, the ejected
minister of St. Stephen’s, Walbrook, who, soon after the Act of Uniformity, had collected a church in that
place. Mr. Watson was an eminent Presbyterian divine, and the society which he was instrumental in
founding became afterwards, under the ministry of Dr. Grosvenor, one of the most flourishing in the city,
in respect both of numbers and of wealth. It may not be uninteresting here to insert a few brief notices
respecting the place of worship which this congregation occupied, being the scene of Charnock’s labors
during a principal part of his ministry, and that in connection with which he closed his official career.
</p>
<p>
     The place in which this humble Presbyterian congregation1 assembled was a large hall of Crosby
House, an ancient mansion on the east side of Bishopgate Street, erected by Sir John Crosby, Sheriff and
Alderman of London, in 1470. After passing through the hands of several occupants, and, among others,
those of Richard III., who thought it not unfit for being a royal residence, it became, about the year 1640,
the property of Alderman Sir John Langham, a staunch Presbyterian and Loyalist. A calamitous fire
afterwards so injured the building, as to render it unsuitable for a family residence; but the hall, celebrated
for its magnificent oaken ceiling, happily escaped the conflagration, and was converted into a meeting-
house for Mr. Watson’s congregation, of which the proprietor is supposed to have been a member. The
structure, though greatly dilapidated, still exists, and is said to be regarded as one of the most perfect
specimens of the domestic architecture of the fifteenth century now remaining in the metropolis. But, as
an illustration of the vicissitudes such edifices are destined to undergo, it may be stated that Crosby Hall,
after having witnessed the splendors of royalty, and been consecrated to the solemnities of divine
worship, was lately—perhaps it is still—dedicated to the inferior, if not ignoble, uses of a wool-packer.
</p>
<p>
     After saying so much about the building, a word or two respecting the congregation which assembled
for years under its vaulted roof, may not be deemed inappropriate. It was formed, as we have already said,
by the Rev. Thomas Watson, the ejected minister of St. Stephen’s, Walbrook. This took place in 1662,
and Charnock was Mr. Watson’s colleague for five years. Mr. Watson was succeeded by the son of an
ejected minister, the Rev. Samuel Slater, who discharged the pastoral duties with great ability and
faithfulness for twenty-four years, and closed his ministry and life with this solemn patriarchal sentence
addressed to his people:—“I charge you before God, that you prepare to meet me at the day of judgment,
as my crown of joy; and that not one of you be wanting at the right hand of God.” Dr. Benjamin
Grosvenor succeeded Mr. Slater. His singular acumen, graceful utterance, lively imagination, and fervid
devotion, are said to have secured for the congregation a greater degree of prosperity than it had ever
before enjoyed. A pleasing recollection has been preserved, of perhaps one of the most touching
discourses ever composed, having been delivered by him in this Hall, on The Temper of Christ. In this
discourse the Saviour is introduced, by way of illustrating his own command that “repentance and
remission of sins should be preached unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem,” as giving the Apostles
directions how they are to proceed in carrying out this requirement. Amongst other things, he is
represented as saying to them:—“Go into all nations and offer this salvation as you go; but lest the poor
house of Israel should think themselves abandoned to despair, the seed of Abraham, mine ancient friend;
as cruel and unkind as they have been, go, make them the first offer of grace; let them that struck the rock,
drink first of its refreshing streams; and they that drew my blood, be welcome to its healing virtue. Tell
them, that as I was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, so, if they will be gathered, I will be their
shepherd still. Though they despised my tears which I shed over them, and imprecated my blood to be
upon them, tell them ’twas for their sakes I shed both; that by my tears I might soften their hearts towards
God, and by my blood I might reconcile God to them .... ...Tell them, you have seen the prints of the
nails upon my hands and feet, and the wounds of the spear in my side; and that those marks of their
cruelty are so far from giving me vindictive thoughts, that, if they will but repent, every wound they have
given me speaks in their behalf, pleads with the Father for the remission of their sins, and enables me to
bestow it .... ...Nay, if you meet that poor wretch that thrust the spear into my side, tell him there is
another way, a better way, of coming at my heart. If he will repent, and look upon him whom he has
pierced, and will mourn, I will cherish him in that very bosom he has wounded; he shall find the blood he
shed an ample atonement for the sin of shedding it. And tell him from me, he will put me to more pain
and displeasure by refusing this offer of my blood, than when he first drew it forth.” In Dr. Grosvenor’s
old age, notwithstanding that he was assisted, from time to time, by eminent divines, the congregation
began to decline. After his death, the pastoral charge was held by Dr. Hodge and Mr. Jones successively,
but, under the ministry of the latter, the church had become so enfeebled, that, on the expiration of the
lease in 1769, the members agreed to dissolve, and were gradually absorbed in other societies.
</p>
<p>
    From this digression we return, only to record the last circumstance necessary to complete this brief
sketch. The death of Charnock took place July 27, 1680, when he was in the fifty-third year of his age.
The particulars that have come down to us of this event, like those of the other parts of his history, are
scanty, yet they warrant us to remark that he died in a frame of mind every way worthy of his excellent
character and holy life. He was engaged, at the time, in delivering to his people, at Crosby Hall, that series
of Discourses on the Existence and Attributes of God, on which his fame as a writer chiefly rests. The
intense interest which he was observed to take in the subjects of which he treated, was regarded as an
indication that he was nearly approaching that state in which he was to be “filled with all the fulness of
God.” Not unfrequently was he heard to give utterance to a longing desire for that region for which he
gave evidence of his being so well prepared. These circumstances were, naturally enough, looked upon as
proofs that his mighty mind, though yet on earth, had begun to “put off its mortality,” and was fast
ripening for the paradise of God. From his death taking place in the house of Mr. Richard Tymns, in the
parish of Whitechapel, London, it may be inferred that his departure was sudden. The body was
immediately after taken to the meeting-house at Crosby Square, which had been so often the scene of his
prayers and preaching. From thence, accompanied by a long train of mourners, it was conveyed to St.
Michael’s Church, Cornhill, where it was deposited hard by the Tower under the belfrey. The funeral
sermon was preached by his early friend and fellow-student at Cambridge, Mr. John Johnson, from these
apposite words:—“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”
</p>
<p>
     Such is an outline of the facts, as far as they are known, of the life of this great man. There are none, it
is true, of those striking occurrences and marvellous incidents in the narrative, which attract the notice of
the multitude, and which are so gratifying to those who are in quest of excitement more than of
edification. But, let it not be thought that, for this reason, the narrative must be destitute of the materials
of personal improvement. If the advantages to be derived from a piece of biography are at all proportioned
to the degree in which the character and circumstances of the subject resemble those of the reader, a
greater number, at least, may be expected to obtain benefit from a life, the incidents of which are more
common, inasmuch as there are but comparatively few, the events of whose history are of an
extraordinary and dazzling description. “When a character,” to use the language of a profound judge of
human nature,2 “selected from the ordinary ranks of life, is faithfully and minutely delineated, no effort is
requisite to enable us to place ourselves in the same situation; we accompany the subject of the narrative,
with an interest undiminished by distance, unimpaired by dissimilarity of circumstances; and, from the
efforts by which he surmounted difficulties and vanquished temptations, we derive the most useful
practical lessons. He who desires to strengthen his virtue and purify his principles, will always prefer the
solid to the specious; will be more disposed to contemplate an example of the unostentatious piety and
goodness which all men may obtain, than of those extraordinary achievements to which few can aspire;
nor is it the mark of a superior, but rather a vulgar and superficial taste, to consider nothing as great or
excellent but that which glitters with titles, or is elevated by rank.”
</p>
<p>
     Let us endeavor to portray the character of Charnock.
</p>
<p>
     The mental qualities by which he was most distinguished as a man, were judgment and imagination.
The reasoning faculty, naturally strong, was improved by diligent training and habitual exercise. In
tracing the relations and tendencies of things, he greatly excelled; he could compare and contrast with
admirable ease and beautiful discrimination; and his deductions, as was to be expected, were usually
sound and logical. Judgment was, indeed, the presiding faculty in his, as it ought to be in all minds.
</p>
<p>
     The more weighty qualities of intellect were in him united to a brilliant fancy. By this means he was
enabled to adorn the more solid materials of thought with the attractive hues of inventive genius. His fine
and teeming imagination, ever under the strict control of reason and virtue, was uniformly turned to the
most important purposes. This department of mental phenomena, from the abuses to which it is liable, is
apt to be undervalued; yet, were this the proper place, it would not be difficult to show that imagination is
one of the noblest faculties with which man has been endowed—a faculty, indeed, the sound and proper
use of which is not only necessary to the existence of sympathy and other social affections, but also
intimately connected with those higher exercises of soul, by which men are enabled to realize the things
that are not seen and eternal. Charnock’s imagination was under the most cautious and skilful
management—the handmaid, not the mistress of his reason—and, doubtless, it tended, in no small degree,
to free his character from that cold and contracted selfishness which is apt to predominate in those who
are deficient in this quality; to impart a generous warmth to his intercourse with others; and to throw over
his compositions as an author an animating and delightful glow.
</p>
<p>
     These qualities of mind were associated with habits of intense application and persevering diligence,
which alike tended to invigorate his original powers, and enabled him to turn them all to the best account.
To the original vigor of his powers must be added that which culture supplied. Charnock was a highly
educated man. As remarked by the first editors of his works, he was not only “a person of excellent parts,
strong reason, great judgment, and curious fancy,” but “of high improvements and general learning, as
having been all his days a most diligent and methodical student.” An alumnus of both the English
universities, he may be said to have drawn nourishment from each of these generous mothers. He had the
reputation of being a general scholar; his acquisitions being by no means limited to the literature of his
profession. Not only was his, acquaintance with the original languages of Scripture great, but he had made
considerable attainments in the study of medicine; and, indeed, there was scarcely any branch of learning
with which he was unacquainted. All his mental powers were thus strengthened and refined by judicious
discipline, and, as we shall see presently, he knew well how to devote his treasures, whether original or
acquired, to the service of the Redeemer; and to consecrate the richest stores of natural genius and
educational attainment, by laying them all at the foot of the Cross.
</p>
<p>
     But that which gave the finish to Charnock’s intellectual character, was not the predominance of any
one quality so much as the harmonious and nicely balanced union of all. Acute perception, sound
judgment, masculine sense, brilliant imagination, habits of reflection, and a complete mastery over the
succession of his thoughts, were all combined in that comely order and that due proportion which go to
constitute a well-regulated mind. There was, in his case, none of that disproportionate development of any
one particular faculty, which, in some cases, serves, like an overpowering glare, to dim, if not almost to
quench the splendor of the rest. The various faculties of his soul, to make use of a figure, rather shone
forth like so many glittering stars, from the calm and clear firmament of his mind, each supplying its
allotted tribute of light, and contributing to the serene and solemn lustre of the whole. As has been said of
another, so may it be said of him—“If it be rare to meet with an individual whose mental faculties are thus
admirably balanced, in whom no tyrant faculty usurps dominion over the rest, or erects a despotism on the
ruins of the intellectual republic; still more rare is it to meet with such a mind in union with the far higher
qualities of religious and moral excellence.”
</p>
<p>
     Nor were Charnock’s moral qualities less estimable than his intellectual. He was a pre-eminently holy
man, distinguished at once by personal purity, social equity, and habitual devotion. Early the subject of
saving grace, he was in his own person an excellent example of the harmony of faith, with the philosophy
of the moral feelings. Strongly he felt that while “not without law to God,” he was nevertheless “under
law to Christ.” The motives from which he acted in every department of moral duty were evangelical
motives; and so entirely was he imbued with the spirit, so completely under the power of the gospel, that
whatever he did, no matter how humble in the scale of moral duty, he “served the Lord Christ.” The
regulating principle of his whole life is embodied in the apostolical injunction:—“Whatsoever ye do, do it
heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.” The various talents with which he was gifted by the God of
nature, were all presided over by an enlightened and deep-toned piety, for which he was indebted to the
sovereign grace of God in the Lord Jesus Christ. It was this that struck the key-note of the intellectual and
moral harmony to which we have adverted as a prominent feature in his character. This at once directed
each faculty to its proper object, and regulated the measure of its exercise. Devotion was the very element
in which he lived and breathed, and had his being. Devout communion with Supreme Excellence, the
contemplation of celestial themes, and preparation for a higher state of being, constituted the truest
pleasures of his existence, elevated him far above the control of merely sentient and animal nature, and
secured for him an undisturbed repose of mind, which was itself but an antepast of what awaited him in
the unclouded region of glory. Nor was his devotion transient or occasional merely; it was habitual as it
was deep, extending its plastic and sanctifying influence to every feature of character, and every event of
life; dictating at once ceaseless efforts for the welfare of man, and intensest desires for the glory of God;
and securing that rarest perhaps of all combinations, close communion with the future and the eternal, and
the busy and conscientious discharge of the ordinary duties of everyday life.
</p>
<p>
     His natural temper appears to have been reserved, and his manners grave. Regarding the advantages to
be derived from general society as insufficient to compensate for the loss of those to be acquired by
retirement, he cultivated the acquaintance of few, and these few the more intelligent and godly, with
whom, however, putting aside his natural backwardness, he was wont to be perfectly affable and
communicative. But his best and most highly cherished companions were his books, of which he had
contrived to secure a valuable though select collection. With these he held frequent and familiar
intercourse. Great part of his time, indeed, was spent in his study; and when the calls of unavoidable duty
compelled him to leave it, so bent was he on redeeming time, that, not content with appropriating the
hours usually devoted to sleep, he cultivated the habit of thinking while walking along the streets. So
successful was he in his efforts of abstraction, that, amid the most crowded and attractive scenes, he could
withdraw his mind easily from the vanities which solicited his attention, and give himself up to close
thinking and useful meditation. The productions of his pen, and the character of his pulpit services, bore
ample evidence that the hours of retirement were given neither to frivolous vacuity nor to self-indulgent
sloth, but to the industrious cultivation of his powers, and to conscientious preparation for public duty. He
was not content, like many, with the mere reputation of being a recluse; on the contrary, he was set on
bringing forth the fruits of a hard student. There was always one day in the week in which he made it to
appear that the others were not misspent. His Sabbath ministrations were not the loose vapid effusions of
a few hours’ careless preparation, but were rather the substantial, well-arranged, well-compacted products
of much intense thought and deep cogitation. “Had he been less in his study,” says his editors quaintly,
“he would have been less liked in the pulpit.”
</p>
<p>
    To a person of these studious habits it may easily be conceived what distress it must have occasioned
to have his library swept away from him. In that dreadful misfortune which befell the metropolis in 1666,
ever since known as “the fire of London,” the whole of Charnock’s books were destroyed. The amount of
calamity involved in such an occurrence can be estimated aright only by those who know from experience
the strength and sacredness of that endearment with which the real student regards those silent but
instructive friends which he has drawn around him by slow degrees; with which he has cultivated a long
and intimate acquaintance; which are ever at hand with their valuable assistance, counsel and consolation,
when these are needed; which, unlike some less judicious companions, never intrude upon him against his
will; and with whose very looks and positions, as they repose in their places around him, he has become
so familiarized, that it is no difficult thing for him to call up their appearance when absent, or to go
directly to them in the dark without the risk of a mistake. Some may be disposed to smile at this love of
books. But where is the scholar who will do so? Where is the man of letters who, for a single moment,
would place the stately mansions and large estates of the “sons of earth” in comparison with his own well-
loaded shelves? Where the student who, on looking round upon the walls of his study, is not conscious of
a satisfaction greater and better far than landed proprietor ever felt on surveying his fields and lawns—a
satisfaction which almost unconsciously seeks vent in the exclamation, “My library! a dukedom large
enough!” Such, and such only, can judge what must have been Charnock’s feelings, when he found that
his much cherished volumes had become a heap of smouldering ashes. The sympathetic regret is only
rendered the more intense, when it is thought that, in all probability, much valuable manuscript perished
in the conflagration.
</p>
<p>
    Charnock excelled as a Preacher. This is an office which, whether as regards its origin, nature, design,
or effects, it will be difficult to overrate. The relation in which it stands to the salvation of immortal souls,
invests it with an interest overwhelmingly momentous. Our former remarks will serve to show how well
he of whom we now speak was qualified for acting in this highest of all the capacities in which man is
required to serve. His mental and moral endowments, his educational acquirements, his habitual
seriousness, his sanctified imagination, and his vigorous faith, pre-eminently fitted him for discharging
with ability and effect the duties of a herald of the Cross. Of his style of preaching we may form a pretty
accurate idea from the writings he has left, which were all of them transcribed from the notes of his
sermons. We hence infer that his discourses, while excelling in solid divinity and argumentative power,
were not by any means deficient in their practical bearing, being addressed not more to the understandings
than to the hearts of his hearers. “Nothing,” it has been justly remarked, “can be more nervous than his
reasoning, nothing more affecting than his applications.” While able to unravel with great acuteness and
judgment the intricacies of a nice question in polemics, he could with no less dexterity and skill address
himself to the business of the Christian life, or to the casuistry of religious experience. Perspicuous
plainness, convincing cogency, great wisdom, fearless honesty, and affectionate earnestness, are the chief
characteristics of his sermons.
</p>
<p>
    To this it must be added that his preaching was eminently evangelical. So deeply imbued with gospel
truth were his discourses, that, like the Book of the Law of old, they might be said to be sprinkled with
blood, even the blood of atonement. The Cross was at once the basis on which he rested his doctrinal
statements, and the armory from which he drew his most forcible and pointed appeals to the conscience.
His aim seems never once to have been to catch applause to himself by the enticing words of man’s
wisdom, by arraying his thoughts in the motley garb of an affected and gorgeous style, or by having
recourse to the tricks of an inflated and meretricious oratory. His sole ambition appears to have been to
“turn sinners from the error of their ways;” and for this end he wisely judged nothing to be so well
adapted as “holding forth the words of eternal life” in their native simplicity and power, and in a spirit of
sincere and ardent devotion. His object was to move his hearers; not towards himself, but towards his
Master; not to elicit expressions of admiration for the messenger, but to make the message bear on the
salvation of those to whom it was delivered; not to please, so much as to convert, his hearers; not to tickle
their fancy, but to save the soul from death, and thus to hide a multitude of sins.
</p>
<p>
    The character of his preaching, it is true, was adapted to the higher and more intelligent classes; yet
was it not altogether unsuited to those of humbler rank and pretensions. He could handle the mysteries of
the gospel with great perspicuity and plainness, using his profound learning for the purpose, not of
mystifying, but of making things clear, so that persons even in the ordinary walks of life felt him to be not
beyond their capacity. The energy, gravity, and earnestness of his manner, especially when young,
contributed to render him a great favorite with the public, and accordingly he drew after him large and
deeply interested audience—a circumstance which, we can suppose, was valued by him, not because of
the incense which it ministered to a spirit of vanity, but of the opportunity it afforded him of winning
souls to the Redeemer. When more advanced in life, this kind of popularity, we are told, declined, in
consequence of his being compelled from an infirmity of memory to read his sermons, with the additional
disadvantage of requiring to supply defect of sight by the use of a glass. But an increasing weight and
importance in the matter, fully compensated for any deficiency in the manner of his preaching. If the more
flighty of his hearers retired, others—among whom were many of his brethren in the ministry—who knew
how to prefer solidity to show, crowded to supply their places. Reckoning it no ordinary privilege to be
permitted to sit devoutly at the feet of one so well qualified to initiate them into the knowledge of the deep
things of God, they continued to listen to his instructions with as much admiration and profit as ever.
</p>
<p>
    It is as a Writer, however, that Charnock is best known, and this, indeed, is the only character in
which we can now come into contact with him. His works are extensive, but, with a single exception,
posthumous. The only thing published by himself was the piece on “The Sinfulness and Cure of
Thoughts,” which appeared originally in the Supplement to the Morning Exercise at Cripplegate. Yet such
was the quantity of manuscript left behind him at his death, that two large folio volumes were soon
transcribed, and published by his friends, Mr. Adams and Mr. Veal, to whom he had committed his
papers. The Discourse on Providence was the first published; it appeared in 1680. The Discourses on the
Existence and Attributes of God came next, in 1682. There followed in succession the treatises on
Regeneration, Reconciliation, The Lord’s Supper, &amp;c. A second edition of the whole works, in two
volumes, folio, came out in 1684, and a third in 1702—no slight proof of the estimation in which they
were held. Several of the treatises have appeared from time to time in a separate form, especially those on
Divine Providence, on Man’s Enmity to God, and on Mercy for the Chief of Sinners. The best edition of
Charnock’s works is that published in 1815, in nine volumes, royal Svo; with a prefatory Dedication, and
a Memoir of the Author, by the Rev. Edward Parsons of Leeds.
</p>
<p>
    All Charnock’s writings are distinguished for sound theology, profound thinking, and lively
imagination. They partake of that massive divinity for which the Puritan Divines were in general
remarkable, and are of course orthodox in their doctrinal statements and seasonings. Everywhere the
reader meets with the evidences and fruits of deep thought, of a mind, indeed, of unusual comprehension
and energy of grasp, that could penetrate with ease into the very core, and fathom at pleasure the
profoundest depths of the most abstruse and obscure subjects; while, from the rich stores of an exuberant
and hallowed fancy, he was enabled to throw over his compositions the most attractive ornaments, and to
supply spontaneously such illustrations as were necessary to render his meaning more clear, or his lessons
more impressive. In a word, for weight of matter, for energy of thought, for copiousness of improving
reflection, for grandeur and force of illustration, and for accuracy and felicitousness of expression,
Charnock is equalled by few, and surpassed by none of the writers of the age to which he belonged. The
eulogy pronounced by a competent judge on the Treatise on the Attributes, applies with equal justice to all
his other writings:—“Perspicuity and depth; metaphysical subtlety and evangelical simplicity; immense
learning, and plain but irrefragable reasoning, conspire to render that work one of the most inestimable
productions that ever did honor to the sanctified judgment and genius of a human being.”3
</p>
<p>
    The correctness of the composition, in these works, is remarkable, considering that they were not
prepared for the press by the author himself, and that they must have been originally written amid scenes
of distraction and turmoil, arising out of the events of the times. The latter circumstance may account for
the manly vigor by which they are characterized, but it only renders their accuracy and polish the more
wonderful. Refinement of taste and extensive scholarship can alone explain the chasteness, ease, and
elegance of style, so free from all verbosity and clumsiness, which mark these productions. There were
giants in literature in those days, and STEPHEN CHARNOCK was not the least of the noble fraternity.
</p>
<p>
    Charnock may not have all the brilliancy of Bunyan, nor all the metaphysical acumen and subtle
analysis of Howe, nor all the awful earnestness of Baxter; but he is not less argumentative, while he is
more theological than any of them, and his theology, too, is more sound than that of some. “He was not,”
say the original editors of his works, “for that modern divinity which is so much in vogue with some, who
would be counted the only sound divines; having tasted the old, he did not desire the new, but said the old
is better.” There is, therefore, not one of all the Puritan Divines whose writings can with more safety be
recommended to the attention of students of divinity and young ministers. It is one of the happy signs of
the times in which we live, that a taste for reading such works is beginning to revive; and we can conceive
no better wish for the interests of mankind in general, and of our country in particular, than that the minds
of our young divines were thoroughly impregnated with the good old theology to be found in such
writings as those which we now take the liberty to introduce and recommend. “If a preacher wishes to
recommend himself by the weight of his doctrines,” to use the language of Mr. Parsons, “he will find in
the writings of Charnock the great truths of Scripture illustrated and explained in the most lucid and
masterly manner. If he wishes to be distinguished by the evangelical strain of his discourses, and by the
continual exhibition of Christ and him crucifled, he will here find the characters of Christ, and the
adaptation of the gospel to the circumstances and wants of man as a fallen creature, invariably kept in
view. If he wishes for usefulness in the Church of God, here he has the brightest example of forcible
appeals to the conscience, and of the most impressive applications of Scripture truth, to the various
conditions of mankind. And, finally, if he reads for his own advantage as a Christian, his mind will be
delighted with the inexhaustible variety here provided for the employment of his enlightened faculties,
and his improvement in every divine attainment.”
</p>
<p>
    Happy shall we be, if what we have written shall, by the blessing of God, prove the means of
producing or reviving a taste for reading the works of our author, being fully convinced with a former
editor, that, “while talent is respected, or virtue revered—while holiness of conversation, consistency of
character, or elevation of mind, are considered as worthy of imitation—while uniform and strenuous
exertion for the welfare of man is honored, and constant devotedness to the glory of God admired, the
memory of CHARNOCK shall be held in grateful remembrance.”

<div class="chapter">
<h1 class="caption">  TO THE READER</h1>

<p>
     THIS long since promised and greatly expected volume of the reverend author upon the Divine
Attributes, being transcribed out of his own manuscripts by the unwearied diligence of those worthy
persons that undertook it,4 is now at last come to thy hands: doubt not but thy reading will pay for thy
waiting, and thy satisfaction make full compensation for thy patience. In the epistle before his treatise on
Providence, it was intimated that his following discourses would not be inferior to that; and we are
persuaded that, ere thou hast perused one half of this, thou wilt acknowledge that it was modestly spoken.
Enough, assure thyself, thou wilt find here for thy entertainment and delight, as well as profit. The
sublimeness, variety, and rareness of the truths here handled, together with the elegancy of the
composure, neatness of the style, and whatever is wont to make any book desirable, will all concur in the
recommendation of this. What so high and noble a subject, what so fit for his meditations or thine, as the
highest and noblest Being, and those transcendently glorious perfections wherewith he is clothed! A mere
contemplation of the Divine excellencies may afford much pleasure to any man that loves to exercise his
reason, and is addicted to speculation: but what incomparable sweetness, then, will holy souls find in
viewing and considering those perfections now, which they are more fully to behold hereafter; and seeing
what manner of God, how wise and powerful, how great, and good, and holy is he, in whom the covenant
interests them, and in the enjoyment of whom their happiness consists! If rich men delight to sum up their
vast revenues, to read over their rentals, look upon their hoards; if they bless themselves in their great
wealth, or, to use the prophet’s words (Jer. 9:23), “glory in their riches,” well may believers rejoice and
glory in their “knowing the Lord” (ver. 24), and please themselves in seeing how rich they are in having
an immensely full and all-sufficient God for their inheritance. Alas! how little do most men know of that
Deity they profess to serve, and own, not as their Sovereign only, but their Portion. To such this author
might say, as Paul to the Athenians, “Whom you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you” (Acts
17:23). These treatises, reader, will inform thee who He is whom thou callest thine, present thee with a
view of thy chief good, and make thee value thyself a thousand times more upon thy interest with God,
than upon all external accomplishments and worldly possessions. Who but delights to hear well of one
whom he loves! God is thy love, if thou be a believer; and then it cannot but fill thee with delight and
ravishment to hear so much spoken in his praise. David desired to “dwell in the house of the Lord,” that
he might there behold his beauty: how much of that beauty, if thou art but capable of seeing it, mayest
thou behold in this volume, which was our author’s main business, for about three years before he died, to
display before his hearers! True, indeed, the Lord’s glory, as shining forth before his heavenly courtiers
above, is unapproachable by mortal men; but what of it is visible in his works—creation, providence,
redemption—falls under the cognizance of his inferior subjects here. And this is, in a great measure,
presented to view in these discourses; and so much, we may well say, as may, by the help of grace, be
effectual to raise thy admiration, attract thy love, provoke thy desires, and enable thee to make some guess
at what is yet unseen; and why not, likewise, to clear thy eyes, and prepare them for future sight, as well
as turn them away from the contemptible vanities of this present life? Whatever is glorious in this world,
yet (as the apostle, in another case) “hath no glory, by reason of the glory that excels” (2 Cor. 3:10). This
“excellent glory” is the subject of this book, to which all created beauty is but mere shadow and
duskiness. If thy eyes be well fixed on this, they will not be easily drawn to wander after other objects: if
thy heart be taken with God, it will be mortified to everything that is not God.
</p>
<p>
     But thou hast in this book, not only an excellent subject in the general, but great variety of matter for
the employment of thy understanding, as well as enlivening thy affections, and that, too, such as thou wilt
not find elsewhere: many excellent things which are out of the road of ordinary preachers and writers, and
which may be grateful to the curious, no less than satisfactory to the wise and judicious. It is not,
therefore, a book to be played with or slept over, but read with the most intent and serious mind; for
though it afford much pleasure for the fancy, yet much more work for the heart, and hath, indeed, enough
in it to busy all the faculties. The dress is complete and decent, yet pot garish nor theatrical; the rhetoric
masculine and vigorous, such as became a pulpit, and was never borrowed from the stage; the expressions
full, clear, apt, and such as are best suited to the weightiness and spirituality of the truths here delivered. It
is plain he wag no empty preacher, but was more for sense than sound, filled up his words with matter,
and chose rather to inform his hearers’ minds than to claw any itching ears. Yet we will not say but some
little things, a word, or a phrase now and then he may have, which, no doubt, had he lived to transcribe
his own sermons, he would have altered. If in some lesser matters he differ from thee, it is but in such as
godly and learned men do frequently, and may, without breach of charity, differ in among themselves: in
some things he may differ from us too, and, it may be, we from each other; and where are there any two
persons who have in all, especially the more disputable points of religion, exactly the same sentiments,—
at least, express themselves altogether in the same terms? But this we must say, that though he treat of
many of the most abstruse and mysterious doctrines of Christianity, which are the subjects of great
debates and controversies in the world, yet we find no one material thing in which he may justly be called
heterodox (unless old heresies be of late grown orthodox, and his differing from them must make him
faulty), but generally delivers, as in his former pieces,5 what is most consonant to the faith of this and
other, the best reformed churches. He was not, indeed, for that modern divinity which is so much in vogue
with some who would be counted the only sound divines; having “tasted the old,” he did not desire “the
new,” but said, “the old is better.” Some errors, especially the Socinian, he sets himself industriously
against, and cuts the very sinews of them, yet sometimes almost without naming them.
</p>
<p>
     In the doctrinal part of several of his discourses thou wilt find the depth of polemical divinity, and in
his inferences from thence, the sweetness of practical; some things which may exercise the profoundest
scholar, and others which may instruct and edify the weakest Christian. Nothing is more nervous than his
reasonings, and nothing more affecting than his applications. Though he make great use of achoolmen, yet
they are certainly more beholden to him than he to them; he adopts their notions, but he refines them too,
and improves them and reforms them from the barbarousness in which they were expressed, and dresseth
them up in his own language (so far as the nature of the matter will permit, and more clear terms are to be
found), and so makes them intelligible to vulgar capacities, which, in their original rudeness, were
obscure and strange even to learned heads.
</p>
<p>
     In a word, he handles the great truths of the gospel with that perspicuity, gravity, and majesty, which
best becomes the oracles of God; and we have reason to believe, that no judicious and unbiassed reader
but will acknowledge this to be incomparably the best practical treatise the world ever saw in English
upon this subject. What Dr. Jackson did, to whom our author gave all due respect, was more brief and in
another way. Dr. Preston did worthily upon the Attributes in his day; but his discourses likewise, are more
succinct, when this author’s are more full and large. But whatever were the mind of God in it, it was not
his will that either of these two should live to finish what he had begun, both being taken away when
preaching upon this subject. Happy souls! whose last breath was spent in so noble a work, praising God
while they had any being (Ps. 146:2).
</p>
<p>
     His method is much the same in most of these discourses, both in the doctrinal and practical part,
which will make the whole more plain and facile to ordinary readers. He rarely makes objections, and yet
frequently answers them, by implying them in those propositions he lays down for the clearing up the
truths he asserts. His dexterity is admirable in the applicatory work, where he not only brings down the
highest doctrines to the lowest capacities, but collects great variety of proper, pertinent, useful, and yet,
many times, unthought-of inferences, and that from those truths, which however they afford much matter
for inquisition and speculation, yet might seem, unless to the most intelligent and judicious Christians, to
have a more remote influence upon practice. He is not like some school writers, whe attenuate and rarefy
the matter they discourse of to a degree bordering upon annihilation, at least, beat it so thin, that a puff of
breath may blow it away; spin their thread so fine, that the cloth, when made up, proves useless, solidity
dwindles into niceties, and what we thought we had got by their assertions, we lose by their distinctions.
But if our author have some subtilties and superfine notions in his argumentations, yet he condenseth
them again, and consolidates them into substantial and profitable corollaries in his applications; and in
them his main business is, as to discipline a profane world for its neglect of God, and contempt of him in
his most adorable and shining perfections, so likewise to show how the Divine Attributes are not only
infinitely excellent in themselves, but a grand foundation for all true divine worship, and should be the
great motives to provoke men to the exercise of faith, and love, and fear, and humility, and all that holy
obedience they are called to by the gospel; and this, without peradventure, is the great end of all those rich
discoveries God hath in his word made of himself to us. And, reader, if these elaborate discourses of this
holy man, through the Lord’s blessing, become a means of promoting holiness in thee, and stir thee up to
love and live to the God of his praise (Ps. 109:1), we are well assured that his end in preaching them is
answered, and so is ours in publishing them.

<h1 class="caption"> DISCOURSE I - ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD</h1>
<blockquote>
The fool hath said in his heart There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
<div class="sig"> PSALM 14:1</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
    THIS psalm is a description of the deplorable corruption by nature of every son of Adam, since the
withering of that common root. Some restrain it to the Gentiles, as a wilderness full of briers and thorns,
as not concerning the Jews, the garden of God, planted by his grace, and watered by the dew of heaven.
But the apostle, the best interpreter, rectifies this in extending it by name to Jews, as well as Gentiles,
(Rom. 6:9.) “We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin,” and (ver. 10–12)
cites part of this psalm and other passages of scripture for the further evidence of it, concluding by Jews
and Gentiles, every person in the world naturally in this state of corruption.
</p>
<p>
    The psalmist first declares the corruption of the faculties of the soul, The fool hath said in his heart;
secondly, the streams issuing from thence, they are corrupt, &amp;c.: the first in atheistical principles, the
other in unworthy practice; and lays all the evil, tyranny, lust, and persecutions by men, (as if the world
were only for their sake) upon the neglects of God, and the atheism cherished in their hearts.
</p>
<p>
    The fool, a term in scripture signifying a wicked man, used also by the heathen philosophers to signify
a vicious person, ‫ גבל‬as coming from ‫ נבל‬signifies the extinction of life in men, animals, and plants; so the
word ‫ נבל‬is taken, a plant that hath lost all that juice that made it lovely and useful.6 So a fool is one that
hath lost his wisdom, and right notion of God and divine things which were communicated to man by
creation; one dead in sin, yet one not so much void of rational faculties as of grace in those faculties, not
one that wants reason, but abuses his reason. In Scripture the word signifies foolish.7
</p>
<p>
    Said in his heart; that is, he thinks, or he doubts, or he wishes. The thoughts of the heart are in the
nature of words to God, though not to men. It is used in the like case of the atheistical person, (Ps. 10:11,
13) “He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.” He
doth not form a syllogism, as Calvin speaks, that there is no God: he dares not openly publish it, though
he dares secretly think it. He cannot raze out the thoughts of a Deity, though he endeavors to blot those
characters of God in his soul. He hath some doubts whether there be a God or no: he wishes there were
not any, and sometimes hopes there is none at all. He could not so ascertain himself by convincing
arguments to produce to the world, but he tampered with his own heart to bring it to that persuasion, and
smothered in himself those notices of a Deity; which is so plain against the light of nature, that such a
man may well be called a fool for it.
</p>
<p>
    There is no God8 ‫ לית שׁולטנא‬non potestas Domini, Chaldae. It is not Jehovah, which name signifies
the essence of God, as the prime and supreme being; but Eloahia, which name signifies the providence of
God, God as a rector and judge. Not that he denies the existence of a Supreme Being, that created the
world, but his regarding the creatures, his government of the world, and consequently his reward of the
righteous or punishments of the wicked.
</p>
<p>
    There is a threefold denial of God,9 1. Quoad existentiam; this is absolute atheism. 2. Quoad
Providentiam, or his inspection into, or care of the things of the world, bounding him in the heavens. 3.
Quoad naturam, in regard of one or other of the perfections due to his nature.
</p>
<p>
    Of the denial of the providence of God most understand this, not excluding the absolute atheist, as
Diagoras is reported to be, nor the skeptical atheist, as Protagoras, who doubted whether there were a
God.10 Those that deny the providence of God, do in effect deny the being of God; for they strip him of
that wisdom, goodness, tenderness, mercy, justice, righteousness, which are the glory of the Deity. And
that principle, of a greedy desire to be uncontrolled in their lusts, which induceth men to a denial of
Providence, that thereby they might stifle those seeds of fear which infect and embitter their sinful
pleasures, may as well lead them to deny that there is any such being as a God. That at one blow, their
fears may be dashed all in pieces and dissolved by the removal of the foundation: as men who desire
liberty to commit works of darkness, would not have the lights in the house dimmed, but extinguished.
What men say against Providence, because they would have no check in their lusts, they may say in their
hearts against the existence of God upon the same account; little difference between the dissenting from
the one and disowning the other.
</p>
<p>
    They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. He speaks of the
atheist in the singular, “the fool;” of the corruption issuing in the life in the plural; intimating that though
some few may choke in their hearts the sentiments of God and his providence, and positively deny them,
yet there is something of a secret atheism in all, which is the fountain of the evil practices in their lives,
not an utter disowning of the being of a God, but a denial or doubting of some of the rights of his nature.
When men deny the God of purity, they must needs be polluted in soul and body, and in their actions.
When the sense of religion is shaken off, all kinds of wickedness is eagerly rushed into, whereby they
become as loathsome to God as putrefied carcases are to men.11 Not one or two evil actions is the product
of such a principle, but the whole scene of a man’s life is corrupted and becomes execrable.
</p>
<p>
    No man is exempted from some spice of atheism by the depravation of his nature, which the psalmist
intimates, “there is none that doeth good:” though there are indelible convictions of the being of a God,
that they cannot absolutely deny it; yet there are some atheistical bubblings in the hearts of men, which
evidence themselves in their actions. As the apostle, (Tit. 1:16,) “They profess that they know God, but in
works they deny him.” Evil works are a dust stirred up by an atheistical breath. He that habituates himself
in some sordid can scarcely be said seriously and firmly to believe that there is a God in being; and the
apostle doth not say that they know God, but they profess to know him: true knowledge and profession of
knowledge are distinct. It intimates also to us, the unreasonableness of atheism in the consequence, when
men shut their eyes against the beams of so clear a sun, God revengeth himself upon them for their
impiety, by leaving them to their own wills, lets them fall into the deepest sink and dregs of iniquity; and
since they doubt of him in their hearts, suffers them above others to deny him in their works, this the
apostle discourseth at large.12 The text then is a description of man’s corruption.
</p>
<p>
    1. Of his mind. The fool hath said in his heart. No better title than that of a fool is afforded to the
atheist.
</p>
<p>
    2. Of the other faculties, 1. In sins of commission, expressed by the loathsomeness (corrupt,
abominable), 2. In sins of omission (there is none that doeth good) he lays down the corruption of the
mind as the cause, the corruption of the other faculties as the effect.
</p>
<p>
    I. It is a great folly to deny or doubt of the existence or being of God: or, an atheist is a great fool.
</p>
<p>
    II. Practical atheism is natural to man in his corrupt state. It is against nature as constituted by God,
but natural, as nature is depraved by man: the absolute disowning of the being of a God is not natural to
men, but the contrary is natural; but an inconsideration of God, or misrepresentation of his nature, is
natural to man as corrupt.
</p>
<p>
     III. A secret atheism, or a partial atheism, is the spring of all the wicked practices in the world: the
disorders of the life spring from the ill dispositions of the heart.
</p>
<p>
     For the first, every atheist is a grand fool. If he were not a fool, he would not imagine a thing so
contrary to the stream of the universal reason of the world, contrary to the rational dictates of his own
soul, and contrary to the testimony of every creature, and link in the chain of creation: if he were not a
fool, he would not strip himself of humanity, and degrade himself lower than the most despicable brute. It
is a folly; for though God be so inaccessible that we cannot know him perfectly, yet he is so much in the
light, that we cannot be totally ignorant of him; as he cannot be comprehended in his essence, he cannot
be unknown in his existence; it is as easy by reason to understand that he is, as it is difficult to know what
he is. The demonstrations reason furnisheth us with for the existence of God, will be evidences of the
atheist’s folly. One would think there were little need of spending time in evidencing this truth, since in
the principle of it, it seems to be so universally owned, and at the first, proposal and demand, gains the
assent of most men.
</p>
<p>
     But, 1. Doth not the growth of atheism among us render this necessary? may it not justly be suspected,
that the swarms of atheists are more numerous in our times, than history records to have been in any age,
when men will not only say it in their hearts, but publish it with their lips, and boast that they have shaken
off those shackles which bind other men’s consciences? Doth not the bare-faced debauchery of men
evidence such a settled sentiment, or at least a careless belief of the truth, which lies at the root, and
sprouts up in such venomous branches in the world? Can men’s hearts be free from that principle
wherewith their practices are so openly depraved? It is true, the light of nature shines too vigorously for
the power of man totally to put it out; yet loathsome actions impair and weaken the actual thoughts and
considerations of a Deity, and are like mists that darken the light of the sun, though they cannot
extinguish it: their consciences, as a candlestick, must hold it, though their unrighteousness obscure it,
(Rom. 1:18.) “Who hold the truth in unrighteousness.” The engraved characters of the law of nature
remain, though they daub them with their muddy lusts to make them illegible: so that since the
inconsideration of a Deity is the cause of all the wickedness and extravagances of men; and as Austin
saith, the proposition is always true, the fool hath said in his heart, &amp;c. and more evidently true in this age
than any, it will not be unnecessary to discourse of the demonstrations of this first principle. The apostles
spent little time in urging this truth; it was taken for granted all over the world, and they were generally
devout in the worship of those idols they thought to be gods: that age run from one God to many, and our
age is running from one God to none at all.
</p>
<p>
     2. The existence of God is the foundation of all religion. The whole building totters if the foundation
be out of course: if we have not deliberate and right notions of it, we shall perform no worship, no service,
yield no affection to him. If there be not a God, it is impossible there can be one, for eternity is essential
to the notion of a God; so all religion would be vain, and unreasonable to pay homage to that which is not
in being, nor can ever be. We must first believe that he is, and that he is what he declares himself to be,
before we can seek him, adore him, and devote our affections to him.13 We cannot pay God a due and
regular homage, unless we understand him in his perfections, what he is; and we can pay him no homage
at all, unless we believe that he is.
</p>
<p>
     3. It is fit we should know why we believe, that our belief of a God may appear to be upon undeniable
evidence, and that we may give a better reason for his existence, than that we have heard our parents and
teachers tell us so, and our acquaintance think so. It is as much as to say there is no God, when we know
not why we believe there is, and would not consider the arguments for his existence.
</p>
<p>
     4. It is necessary to depress that secret atheism which is in the heart of every man by nature. Though
every visible object which offers itself to our sense, presents a deity to our minds, and exhorts us to
subscribe to the truth of it; yet there is a root of atheism springing up sometimes in wavering thoughts and
foolish imaginations, inordinate actions, and secret wishes. Certain it is, that every man that doth not love
God, denies God; now can he that disaffects him, and hath a slavish fear of him, wish his existence, and
say to his own heart with any cheerfulness, there is a God, and make it his chief care to persuade himself
of it? he would persuade himself there is no God, and stifle the seeds of it in his reason and conscience,
that he might have the greatest liberty to entertain the allurements of the flesh. It is necessary to excite
men to daily and actual considerations of God and his nature, which would be a bar to much of that
wickedness which overflows in the lives of men.
</p>
<p>
     5. Nor is it unuseful to those who effectually believe and love him; 14 for those who have had a
converse with God, and felt his powerful influences in the secrets of their hearts, to take a prospect of
those satisfactory accounts which reason gives of that God they adore and love; to see every creature
justify them in their owning of him, and affections to him: indeed the evidences of a God striking upon
the conscience of those who resolve to cleave to sin as their chiefest darling, will dash their pleasures with
unwelcome mixtures.
</p>
<p>
     I shall further premise this, That the folly of atheism is evidenced by the light of reason. Men that will
not listen to Scripture, as having no counterpart of it in their souls, cannot easily deny natural reason,
which riseth up on all sides for the justification of this truth. There, is a natural as well as a revealed
knowledge, and the book of the creatures is legible in declaring the being of a God, as well as the
Scriptures are in declaring the nature of a God; there are outward objects in the world, and common
principles in the conscience, whence it may be inferred.
</p>
<p>
     For, 1. God in regard of his existence is not only the discovery of faith, but of reason. God hath
revealed not only his being, but some sparks of his eternal power and godhead in his works, as well as in
his word. (Rom. 1:19, 20), “God hath showed it unto them,”—how?15 in his works; by the things that are
made, it is a discovery to our reason, as shining in the creatures; and an object of our faith as breaking out
upon us in the Scriptures: it is an article of our faith, and an article of our reason. Faith supposeth natural
knowledge, as grace supposeth nature. Faith indeed is properly of things above reason, purely depending
upon revelation. What can be demonstrated by natural light, is not so properly the object of faith; though
in regard of the addition of a certainty by revelation it is so. The belief that God is, which the apostle
speaks of,16 is not so much of the bare existence of God, as what God is in relation to them that seek him,
viz. a rewarder. The apostle speaks of the faith of Abel, the faith of Enoch, such a faith that pleases God:
but the faith of Abel testified in his sacrifice, and the faith of Enoch testified in his walking with God, was
not simply a faith of the existence of God. Cain in the time of Abel, other men in the world in the time of
Enoch, believed this as well as they: but it was a faith joined with the worship of God, and desires to
please him in the way of his own appointment; so that they, believed that God was such as he had
declared himself to be in his promise to Adam, such an one as would be as good as his word, and bruise
the serpent’s head. He that seeks to God according to the mind of God, must believe that he is such a God
that will pardon sin, and justify a seeker of him; that he is a God of that ability and will, to justify a sinner
in that way he hath appointed for the clearing the holiness of his nature, and vindicating the honor of his
law violated by man. No man can seek God or love God, unless he believe him to be thus; and he cannot
seek God without a discovery of his own mind how he would be sought. For it is not a seeking God in any
way of man’s invention, that renders him capable of this desired fruit of a reward. He that believes God as
a rewarder, must believe the promise of God concerning the Messiah. Men under the conscience of sin,
cannot tell without a divine discovery, whether God will reward, or how he will reward the seekers of
him; and therefore cannot act towards him as an object of faith. Would any man seek God merely because
he is, or love him because he is, if he did not know that he should be acceptable to him? The bare
existence of a thing is not the ground of affection to it, but those qualities of it and our interest in it, which
render it amiable and delightful. How can men, whose consciences fly in their faces, seek God or love
him, without this knowledge that he is a rewarder? Nature doth not show any way to a sinner, how to
reconcile God’s provoked justice with his tenderness. The faith the apostle speaks of here is a faith that
eyes the reward as an encouragement, and the will of God as the rule of its acting; he doth not speak
simply of the existence of God.
</p>
<p>
    I have spoken the more of this place, because the Socinians17 use this to decry any natural knowledge
of God, and that the existence of God is only to be known by revelation, so that by that reason any one
that live without the Scripture hath no ground to believe the being of a God. The Scripture ascribes a
knowledge of God to all nations in the world (Rom. 1:19); not only a faculty of knowing, if they had
arguments and demonstrations, as an ignorant man in any art hath a faculty to know; but it ascribes an
actual knowledge (ver.10) “manifest in them;” (ver. 21) “They knew God;” not they might know him;
they knew him when they did not care for knowing him. The notices of God are as intelligible to us by
reason, as any object in the world is visible; he is written in every letter.
</p>
<p>
    2. We are often in the Scripture sent to take a prospect of the creatures for a discovery of God. The
apostles drew arguments from the topics of nature, when they discoursed with those that owned the
Scripture (Rom. 1:19), as well as when they treated with those that were ignorant of it, as Acts 14:16, 17.
And among the philosophers of Athens (Acts 17:27, 29), such arguments the Holy Ghost in the apostles
thought sufficient to convince men of the existence, unity, spirituality, and patience of God. Such
arguments had not been used by them and the prophets from the visible things in the world to silence the
Gentiles with whom they dealt, had not this truth, and much more about God, been demonstrable by
natural reason: they knew well enough that probable arguments would not satisfy piercing and inquisitive
minds.18
</p>
<p>
    In Paul’s account, the testimony of the creatures was without contradiction. God himself justifies this
way of proceeding by his own example, and remits Job to the consideration of the creatures, to spell out
something of his divine perfections.19 And this is so convincing an argument of the existence of God, that
God never vouchsafed any miracle, or put forth any act of omnipotency, besides what was evident in the
creatures, for the satisfaction of the curiosity of any atheist, or the evincing of his being, as he hath done
for the evidencing those truths which were not written in the book of nature, or for the restoring a decayed
worship, or the protection or deliverance of his people. Those miracles in publishing the gospel, indeed,
did demonstrate the existence of some supreme power; but they were not seals designedly affixed for that,
but for the confirmation of that truth, which was above the ken of purblind reason, and purely the birth of
divine revelation. Yet what proves the truth of any spiritual doctrine, proves also in that act the existence
of the Divine Author of it. The revelation always implies a revealer, and that which manifests it to be a
revelation, manifests also the supreme Revealer of it. By the same light the sun manifests other things to
us, it also manifests itself. But what miracles could rationally be supposed to work upon an atheist, who is
not drawn to a sense of the truth proclaimed aloud by so many wonders of the creation? Let us now
proceed to the demonstration of the atheist’s folly.
</p>
<p>
    It is a folly to deny or doubt of a Sovereign Being, incomprehensible in his nature, infinite in his
essence and perfections, independent in his operations, who hath given being to the whole frame of
sensible and intelligible creatures, and governs them according to their several natures, by an
unconceivable wisdom; who fills the heavens with the glory of his majesty, and the earth with the
influences of his goodness.
</p>
<p>
    It is a folly inexcusable to renounce, in this case, all appeal to universal consent, and the joint
assurances of the creatures.
</p>
<p>
    Reason I. ’Tis a folly to deny or doubt of that which hath been the acknowledged sentiment of all
nations, in all places and ages. There is no nation but hath owned some kind of religion, and, therefore, no
nation but hath consented in the notion of a Supreme Creator and Governor.
</p>
<p>
    1. This hath been universal. 2. It hath been constant and uninterrupted. 3. Natural and innate.
</p>
<p>
    First, It hath been universally assented to by the judgments and practices of all nations in the world.
</p>
<p>
    1. No nation hath been exempt from it. All histories of former and latter ages have not produced any
one nation but fell under the force of this truth. Though they have differed in their religions, they have
agreed in this truth; here both heathen, Turk, Jew, and Christian, centre without any contention. No
quarrel was ever commenced upon this score; though about other opinions wars have been sharp, and
enmities irreconcilable. The notion of the existence of a Deity was the same in all, Indians as well as
Britons, Americans as well as Jews. It hath not been an opinion peculiar to this or that people, to this or
that sect of philosophers; but hath been as universal as the reason whereby men are differenced from other
creatures, so that some have rather defined man by animal religiosum, than animal rationale. ’Tis so
twisted with reason that a man cannot be accounted rational, unless he own an object of religion; therefore
he that understands not this, renounceth his humanity when he renounceth a Divinity. No instance can be
given of any one people in the world that disclaimed it. It hath been owned by the wise and ignorant, by
the learned and stupid, by those who had no other guide but the dimmest light of nature, as well as those
whose candles were snuffed by a more polite education, and that without any solemn debate and
contention. Though some philosophers have been known to change their opinions in the concerns of
nature, yet none can be proved to have absolutely changed their opinion concerning the being of a God.
One died for asserting one God; none, in the former ages upon record, hath died for asserting no God. Go
to the utmost bounds of America, you may find people without some broken pieces of the law of nature,
but not without this signature and stamp upon them, though they wanted commerce with other nations,
except as savage as themselves, in whom the light of nature was as it were sunk into the socket, who are
but one remove from brutes, who clothe not their bodies, cover not their shame, yet were they as soon
known to own a God, as they were known to be a people. They were possessed with the notion of a
Supreme Being, the author of the world; had an object of religious adoration; put up prayers to the deity
they owned for the good things they wanted, and the diverting the evils they feared. No people so
untamed where absolute perfect atheism had gained a footing. No one nation of the world known in the
time of the Romans that were without their ceremonies, whereby they signified their devotion to a deity.
They had their places of worship, where they made their vows, presented their prayers, offered their
sacrifices, and implored the assistance of what they thought to be a god; and in their distresses run
immediately, without any deliberation, to their gods: so that the notion of a deity was as inward and
settled in them as their own souls, and, indeed, runs in the blood of mankind. The distempers of the
understanding cannot utterly deface it; you shall scarce find the most distracted bedlam, in his raving fits,
to deny a God, though he may blaspheme, and fancy himself one.
</p>
<p>
    2. Nor doth the idolatry and multiplicity of gods in the world weaken, but confirm this universal
consent. Whatsoever unworthy conceits men have had of God in all nations, or whatsoever degrading
representations they have made of him, yet they all concur in this, that there is a Supreme Power to be
adored. Though one people worshipped the sun, others the fire,—and the Egyptians, gods out of their
rivers, gardens, and fields; yet the notion of a Deity existent, who created and governed the world, and
conferred daily benefits upon them, was maintained by all, though applied to the stars, and in part to those
sordid creatures. All the Dagons of the world establish this truth, and fall down before it. Had not the
nations owned the being of a God, they had never offered incense to an idol: had there not been a deep
impression of the existence of a Deity, they had never exalted creatures below themselves to the honor of
altars: men could not so easily have been deceived by forged deities, if they had not had a notion of a real
one. Their fondness to set up others in the place of God, evidenced a natural knowledge that there was
One who had a right to be worshipped. If there were not this sentiment of a Deity, no man would ever
have made an image of a piece of wood, worshipped it, prayed to it, and said, “Deliver me, for thou art
my God.”20 They applied a general notion to a particular image. The difference is in the manner, and
immediate object of worship, not in the formal ground of worship. The worship sprung from a true
principle, though it was not applied to a right object: while they were rational creatures, they could not
deface the notion; yet while they were corrupt creatures it was not difficult to apply themselves to a wrong
object from a true principle. A blind man knows he hath a way to go as well as one of the clearest sight;
but because of his blindness he may miss the way and stumble into a ditch. No man would be imposed
upon to take a Bristol stone instead of a diamond, if he did not know that there were such things as
diamonds in the world: nor any man spread forth his hands to an idol, if he were altogether without the
sense of a Deity. Whether it be a false or a true God men apply to, yet in both, the natural sentiment of a
God is evidenced; all their mistakes were grafts inserted in this stock, since they would multiply gods
rather than deny a Deity.
</p>
<p>
    How should such a general submission be entered into by all the world, so as to adore things of a base
alloy,21 if the force of religion were not such, that in any fashion a man would seek the satisfaction of his
natural instinct to some object of worship? This great diversity confirms this consent to be a good
argument, for it evidenceth it not to be a cheat, combination or conspiracy to deceive, or a mutual
intelligence, but every one finds it in his climate, yea in himself. People would never have given the title
of a God to men or brutes had there not been a pre-existing and unquestioned persuasion, that there was
such a being;—how else should the notion of a God come into their minds?—the notion that there is a
God must be more ancient.22
</p>
<p>
    3. Whatsoever disputes there have been in the world, this of the existence of God was never the
subject of contention. All other things have been questioned. What jarrings were there among
philosophers about natural things! into how many parties were they split! with what animosities did they
maintain their several judgments! but we hear of no solemn controversies about the existence of a
Supreme Being: this never met with any considerable contradiction: no nation, that hath but other things
to question, would ever suffer this to be disparaged so much as by a public doubt. We find among the
heathen contentions about the nature of God and the number of gods, some asserted an innumerable
multitude of gods, some armed him to be subject to birth and death, some affirmed the entire world was
God; others fancied him to be a circle of a bright fire; others that he was a spirit diffused through the
whole world:23 yet they unanimously concurred in this, as the judgment of universal reason, that there was
such a sovereign Being: and those that were skeptical in everything else, and asserted that the greatest
certainty was that there was nothing certain, professed a certainty in this. The question was not whether
there was a First Cause, but what it was. It is much the same thing, as the disputes about the nature and
matter of the heavens, the sun and planets, though there be great diversity of judgments, yet all agree that
there are heavens, sun, planets; so all the contentions among men about the nature of God, weaken not,
but rather confirm, that there is a God, since there was never a public formal debate about his existence.24
Those that have been ready to pull out one another’s eyes for their dissent from their judgments, sharply
censured one another’s sentiments, envied the births of one another’s wits, always shook hands with an
unanimous consent in this; never censured one another for being of this persuasion, never called it into
question; as what was never controverted among men professing Christianity, but acknowledged by all,
though contending about other things, has reason to be judged a certain truth belonging to the christian
religion; so what was never subjected to any controversy, but acknowledged by the whole world, hath
reason to be embraced as a truth without any doubt.
</p>
<p>
     4. This universal consent is not prejudiced by some few dissenters. History doth not reckon twenty
professed atheists in all ages in the compass of the whole world: and we have not the name of any one
absolute atheist upon record in Scripture; yet it is questioned, whether any of them, noted in history with
that infamous name, were downright deniers of the existence of God, but rather because they disparaged
the deities commonly worshipped by the nations where they lived, as being of a clearer reason to discern
that those qualities, vulgarly attributed to their gods, as lust and luxury, wantonness and quarrels, were
unworthy of the nature of a god.25 But suppose they were really what they are termed to be, what are they
to the multitude of men that have sprung out of the loins of Adam? not so much as one grain of ashes is to
all that were ever turned into that form by any fires in your chimneys. And many more were not sufficient
to weigh down the contrary consent of the whole world, and bear down an universal impression. Should
the laws of a country, agreed universally to by the whole body of the people, be accounted vain, because
an hundred men of those millions disapprove of them, when not their reason, but their folly and base
interest, persuades them to dislike them and dispute against them? What if some men be blind, shall any
conclude from thence that eyes are not natural to men? shall we say that the notion of the existence of
God is not natural to men, because a very small number have been of a contrary opinion? shall a man in a
dungeon, that never saw the sun, deny that there is a sun, because one or two blind men tell him there is
none, when thousands assure him there is.26 Why should then the exceptions of a few, not one to millions,
discredit that which is voted certainly true by the joint consent of the world? Add this, too, that if those
that are reported to be atheists had had any considerable reason to step aside from the common persuasion
of the whole world, it is a wonder it met not with entertainment by great numbers of those, who, by reason
of their notorious wickedness and inward disquiets, might reasonably be thought to wish in their hearts
that there were no God. It is strange if there were any reason on their side, that in so long a space of tine
as hath run out from the creation of the world, there could not be engaged a considerable number to frame
a society for the profession of it. It hath died with the person that started it, and vanished as soon as it
appeared.
</p>
<p>
     To conclude this, is it not folly for any man to deny or doubt of the being of a God, to dissent from all
mankind, and stand in contradiction to human nature? What is the general dictate of nature is a certain
truth. It is impossible that nature can naturally and universally lie. And therefore those that ascribe all to
nature, and set it in the place of God, contradict themselves, if they give not credit to it in that which it
universally affirms. A general consent of all nations is to be esteemed as a law of nature.27 Nature cannot
plant in the minds of all men an assent to a falsity, for then the laws of nature would be destructive to the
reason and minds of men. How is it possible, that a falsity should be a persuasion spread through all
nations, engraven upon the minds of all men, men of the most towering, and men of the most creeping
understanding; that they should consent to it in all places, and in those places where the nations have not
had any known commerce with the rest of the known world? a consent not settled by any law of man to
constrain people to a belief of it: and indeed it is impossible that any law of man can constrain the belief
of the mind. Would not he deservedly be accounted a fool, that should deny that to be gold which hath
been tried and examined by a great number of knowing goldsmiths, and hath passed the test of all their
touch-stones? What excess of folly would it be for him to deny it to be true gold, if it had been tried by all
that had skill in that metal in all nations in the world!
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, It hath been a constant and uninterrupted consent. It hath been as ancient as the first age of
the world; no man is able to mention any time, from the beginning of the world, wherein this notion hath
not been universally owned; it is as old as mankind, and hath run along with the course of the sun, nor can
the date be fixed lower than that.
</p>
<p>
    1. In all the changes of the world, this hath been maintained. In the overturnings of the government of
states, the alteration of modes of worship, this hath stood unshaken. The reasons upon which it was
founded were, in all revolutions of time, accounted satisfactory and convincing, nor could absolute
atheism in the changes of any laws ever gain the favor of any one body of people to be established by a
law. When the honor of the heathen idols was laid in the dust, this suffered no impair. The being of one
God was more vigorously owned when the unreasonableness of multiplicity of gods was manifest; and
grew taller by the detection of counterfeits. When other parts of the law of nature have been violated by
some nations, this hath maintained its standing. The long series of ages hath been so far from blotting it
out, that it hath more strongly confirmed it, and maketh further progress in the confirmation of it. Time,
which hath eaten out the strength of other things, and blasted mere inventions, hath not been able to
consume this. The discovery of all other impostures, never made this by any society of men to be
suspected as one. It will not be easy to name any imposture that hath walked perpetually in the world
without being discovered, and whipped out by some nation or other. Falsities have never been so
universally and constantly owned without public control and question. And since the world hath detected
many errors of the former age, and learning been increased, this hath been so far from being dimmed, that
it hath shone out clearer with the increase of natural knowledge, and received fresh and more vigorous
confirmations.
</p>
<p>
    2. The fears and anxieties in the consciences of men have given men sufficient occasion to root it out,
had it been possible for them to do it. If the notion of the existence of God had been possible to have been
dashed out of the minds of men, they would have done it rather than have suffered so many troubles in
their souls upon the commission of sin; since there did not want wickedness and wit in so many corrupt
ages to have attempted it and prospered in it, had it been possible. How comes it therefore to pass, that
such a multitude of profligate persons that have been in the world since the fall of man, should not have
rooted out this principle, and dispossessed the minds of men of that which gave birth to their tormenting
fears? How is it possible that all should agree together in a thing which created fear, and an obligation
against the interest of the flesh, if it had been free for men to discharge themselves of it? No man, as far as
corrupt nature bears sway in him, is willing to live controlled.
</p>
<p>
    The first man would rather be a god himself than under one:28 why should men continue this notion in
them, which shackled them in their vile inclinations, if it had been in their power utterly to deface it? If it
were an imposture, how comes it to pass, that all the wicked ages of the world could never discover that to
be a cheat, which kept them in continual alarms? Men wanted not will to shake off such apprehensions; as
Adam, so all his posterity are desirous to hide themselves from God upon the commission of sin,29 and by
the same reason they would hide God from their souls. What is the reason they could never attain their
will and their wish by all their endeavors? Could they possibly have satisfied themselves that there were
no God, they had discarded their fears, the disturbers of the repose of their lives, and been unbridled in
their pleasures. The wickedness of the world would never have preserved that which was a perpetual
molestation to it, had it been possible to be razed out.
</p>
<p>
    But since men under the turmoils and lashes of their own consciences could never bring their hearts to
a settled dissent from this truth, it evidenceth, that as it took its birth at the beginning of the world, it
cannot expire, no not in the ashes of it, nor in anything but the reduction of the soul to that nothing from
whence it sprung. This conception is so perpetual, that the nature of the soul must be dissolved before it
be rooted out, nor can it be extinct while the soul endures.
</p>
<p>
    3. Let it be considered also by us that own the Scripture, that the devil deems it impossible to root out
this sentiment. It seems to be so perpetually fixed, that the devil did not think fit to tempt man to the
denial of the existence of a Deity, but persuaded him to believe he might ascend to that dignity and
become a god himself; Gen. 3:1, “Hath God said?” and he there owns him (ver. 5), “Ye shall become as
gods.” He owns God in the question he asks the woman, and persuades our first parents to be gods
themselves. And in all stories, both ancient and modern, the devil was never able to tincture men’s minds
with a professed denial of the Deity, which would have opened a door to a world of more wickedness than
hath been acted, and took away the bar to the breaking out of that evil, which is naturally in the hearts of
men, to the greater prejudice of human societies. He wanted not malice to raze out all the notions of God,
but power: he knew it was impossible to effect it, and therefore in vain to attempt it. He set up himself in
several places of the ignorant world as a god, but never was able to overthrow the opinion of the being of
a God. The impressions of a Deity were so strong as not to be struck out by the malice and power of hell.
</p>
<p>
    What a folly is it then in any to contradict or doubt of this truth, which all the periods of time have not
been able to wear out; which all the wars and quarrels of men with their own consciences have not been
able to destroy; which ignorance and debauchery, its two greatest enemies, cannot weaken; which all the
falsehoods and errors which have reigned in one or other part of the world, have not been able to banish;
which lives in the consents of men in spite of all their wishes to the contrary, and hath grown stronger,
and shone clearer, by the improvements of natural reason!
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, Natural and innate; which pleads strongly for the perpetuity of it. It is natural, though some
think it not a principle writ in the heart of man;30 it is so natural that every man is born with a restless
instinct to be of some kind of religion or other, which implies some object of religion. The impression of a
Deity is as common as reason, and of the same age with reason.31 It is a relic of knowledge after the fall of
Adam, like fire under ashes, which sparkles as soon as ever the heap of ashes is opened. A notion sealed
up in the soul of every man;32 else how could those people who were unknown to one another, separate by
seas and mounts, differing in various customs and manner of living, had no mutual intelligence one with
another, light upon this as a common sentiment, if they had not been guided by one uniform reason in all
their minds, by one nature common to them all: though their climates be different, their tempers and
constitutions various, their imaginations in some things as distant from one another as heaven is from
earth, the ceremonies of their religion not all of the same kind; yet wherever you find human nature, you
find this settled persuasion. So that the notion of a God seems to be twisted with the nature of man, and is
the first natural branch of common reason, or upon either the first inspection of a man into himself and his
own state and constitution, or upon the first sight of any external visible object. Nature within man, and
nature without man, agree upon the first meeting together to form this sentiment, that there is a God. It is
as natural as anything we call a common principle. One thing which is called a common principle and
natural is, that the whole is greater than the parts. If this be not born with us, yet the exercise of reason
essential to man settles it as a certain maxim; upon the dividing anything into several parts, he finds every
part less than when they were altogether. By the same exercise of reason, we cannot cast our eyes upon
anything in the world, or exercise our understandings upon ourselves, but we must presently imagine,
there was some cause of those things, some cause of myself and my own being; so that this truth is as
natural to man as anything he can call most natural or a common principle.
</p>
<p>
    It must be confessed by all, that there is a law of nature writ upon the hearts of men, which will direct
them to commendable actions, if they will attend to the writing in their own consciences. This law cannot
be considered without the notice of a Lawgiver. For it is but a natural and obvious conclusion, that some
superior hand engrafted those principles in man, since he finds something in him twitching him upon the
pursuit of uncomely actions, though his heart be mightily inclined to them; man knows he never planted
this principle of reluctancy in his own soul; he can never be the cause of that which he cannot be friends
with. If he were the cause of it, why doth he not rid himself of it? No man would endure a thing that doth
frequently molest and disquiet him, if he could cashier it. It is therefore sown in man by some hand more
powerful than man, which riseth so high, and is rooted so strong, that all the force that man can use cannot
pull it up. If therefore this principle be natural in man, and the law of nature be natural, the notion of a
Lawgiver must be as natural, as the notion of a printer, or that there is a printer, is obvious upon the sight
of a stamp impressed. After this the multitude of effects in the world step in to strengthen this beam of
natural light, and the direct conclusion from thence is, that that power which made those outward objects,
implanted this inward principle. This is sown in us, born with us, and sprouts up with our growth, or as
one with; it is like letters carved upon the bark of a young plant, which grows up together with us, and the
longer it grows the letters are more legible.33
</p>
<p>
     This is the ground of this universal consent, and why it may well be termed natural. This will more
evidently appear to be natural, because,
</p>
<p>
     1. This consent could not be by mere tradition. 2. Nor by any mutual intelligence of governors to keep
people in awe, which are two things the atheist pleads; the first hath no strong foundation, and that other
is as absurd and foolish as it is wicked and abominable. 3. Nor was it fear first introduced it.
</p>
<p>
     First, It could not be by mere tradition. Many things indeed are entertained by posterity which their
ancestors delivered to them, and that out of a common reverence to their forefathers, and an opinion that
they had a better prospect of things than the increase of the corruption of succeeding ages would permit
them to have. But if this be a tradition handed from our ancestors, they also must receive it from theirs;
we must then ascend to the first man, we cannot else escape a confounding ourselves with running into
infinite. Was it then the only tradition he left to them? Is it not probable he acquainted them with other
things in conjunction with this, the nature of God, the way to worship him, the manner of the world’s
existence, his own state? We may reasonably suppose him to have a good stock of knowledge; what is
become of it? It cannot be supposed, that the first man should acquaint his posterity with an object of
worship, and leave them ignorant of a mode of worship and of the end of worship. We find in Scripture
his immediate posterity did the first in sacrifices, and without doubt they were not ignorant of the other:
how come men to be so uncertain in all other things, and so confident of this, if it were only a tradition?
How did debates and irreconcilable questions start up concerning other things, and this remain untouched,
but by a small number? Whatsoever tradition the first man left besides this, is lost, and no way
recoverable, but by the revelation God hath made in his Word. How comes it to pass this of a God is
longer lived than all the rest which we may suppose man left to his immediate descendants? How come
men to retain the one and forget the other? What was the reason this survived the ruin of the rest, and
surmounted the uncertainties into which the other sunk? Was it likely it should be handed down alone
without other attendants on it at first? Why did it not expire among the Americans, who have lost the
account of their own descent, and the stock from whence they sprung, and cannot reckon above eight
hundred or a thousand years at most? Why was not the manner of the worship of a God transmitted as
well as that of his existence? How came men to dissent in their opinions concerning his nature, whether
he was corporeal or incorporeal, finite or infinite, omnipresent or limited? Why were not men as negligent
to transmit this of his existence as that of his nature? No reason can be rendered for the security of this
above the other, but that there is so clear a tincture of a Deity upon the minds of men, such traces and
shadows of him in the creatures, such indelible instincts within, and invincible arguments without to keep
up this universal consent. The characters are so deep that they cannot possibly be rased out, which would
have been one time or other, in one nation or other, had it depended only upon tradition, since one age
shakes off frequently the sentiments of the former. I cannot think of above one which may be called a
tradition, which indeed was kept up among all nations, viz. sacrifices, which could not be natural but
instituted. What ground could they have in nature, to imagine that the blood of beasts could expiate and
wash off the guilt and stains of a rational creature? Yet they had in all places (but among the Jews, and
some of them only) lost the knowledge of the reason and end of the institution, which the Scripture
acquaints us was to typify and signify the redemption by the Promised Seed. This tradition hath been
superannuated and laid aside in most parts of the world, while this notion of the existence of a God hath
stood firm. But suppose it were a tradition, was it likely to be a mere intention and figment of the first
man? Had there been no reason for it, this posterity would soon have found out the weakness of its
foundation. What advantage had it been to him to transmit so great a falsehood to kindle the fears or raise
the hopes of his posterity, if there were no God? It cannot be supposed he should be so void of that natural
affection men in all ages bear to their descendants, as so grossly to deceive them, and be so contrary to the
simplicity and plainness which appears in all things nearest their original.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, Neither was it by any mutual intelligence of governors among themselves to keep people in
subjection to them. If it were a political design at first, it seems it met with the general nature of mankind
very ready to give it entertainment.
</p>
<p>
     1. It is unaccountable how this should come to pass. It must be either by a joint assembly of them, or a
mutual correspondence. If by an assembly, who were the persons? Let the name of any one be mentioned.
When was the time? Where was the place of this appearance? By what authority did they meet together?
Who made the first motion, and first started this great principle of policy? By what means could they
assemble from such distant parts of the world? Human histories are utterly silent in it, and the Scripture,
the ancientest history, gives an account of the attempt of Babel, but not a word of any sign of this nature.
What mutual correspondence could such have, whose interests are for the most part different, and their
designs contrary to one another? How could they, who were divided by such vast seas, have this mutual
converse? How could those who were different in their customs and manners, agree so unanimously
together in one thing to gull the people? If there had been such a correspondence between the governors
of all nations, what is the reason some nations should be unknown to the world till of late times? How
could the business be so secretly managed, as not to take vent, and issue in a discovery to the world? Can
reason suppose so many in a joint conspiracy, and no man’s conscience in his life under sharp afflictions,
or on his death-bed, when conscience is most awakened, constrain him to reveal openly the cheat that
beguiled the world? How came they to be so unanimous in this notion, and to differ in their rites almost in
every country? why could they not agree in one mode of worship throughout all the world, as well as in
this universal notion? If there were not a mutual intelligence, it cannot be conceived how in every nation
such a state-engineer should rise up with the same trick to keep people in awe. What is the reason we
cannot find any law in any one nation to constrain men to the belief of the existence of a God, since
politic stratagems have been often fortified by laws? Besides, such men make use of principles received to
effect their contrivances, and are not so impolitic as to build designs upon principles that have no
foundation in nature. Some heathen lawgivers have pretended a converse with their gods, to make their
laws be received by the people with a greater veneration, and fix with stronger obligation the observance
and perpetuity of them; but this was not the introducing a new principle, but the supposition of an old
received notion, that there was a God, and an application of that principle to their present design. The
pretence had been vain had not the notion of a God been ingrafted. Politicians are so little possessed with
a reverence of God, that the first mighty one in the Scripture (which may reasonably gain with the atheist
the credit of the ancientest history in the world), is represented without any fear of God.34 An invader and
oppressor of his neighbors, and reputed the introducer of a new worship, and being the first that built
cities after the flood (as Cain was the first builder of them before the flood), built also idolatry with them,
and erected a new worship, and was so far from strengthening that notion the people had of God, that he
endeavored to corrupt it. The first idolatry in common histories being noted to proceed from that part of
the world; the ancientest idol being at Babylon, and supposed to be first invented by this person: whence,
by the way, perhaps Rome is in the Revelations called Babylon, with respect to that similitude of their
saint-worship, to the idolatry first set up in that place.35 ’Tis evident politicians have often changed the
worship of a nation, but it is not upon record that the first thoughts of an object of worship ever entered
into the minds of people by any trick of theirs.
</p>
<p>
     But to return to the present argument, the being of a God is owned by some nations that have scarce
any form of policy among them. ’Tis as wonderful how any wit should hit upon such an invention, as it is
absurd to ascribe it to any human device, if there were not prevailing arguments to constrain the consent.
Besides, how is it possible they should deceive themselves? What is the reason the greatest politicians
have their fears of a Deity upon their unjust practices, as well as other men they intend to befool? How
many of them have had forlorn consciences upon a death-bed, upon the consideration of a God to answer
an account to in another world? Is it credible they should be frighted by that wherewith they knew they
beguiled others? No man satisfying his pleasures would impose such a deceit upon himself to render and
make himself more miserable than the creatures he hath dominion over.
</p>
<p>
     2. It is unaccountable how it should endure so long a time; that this policy should be so fortunate as to
gain ground in the consciences of men, and exercise an empire over them, and meet with such an
universal success. If the notion of a God were a state-engine, and introduced by some political grandees,
for the ease of government, and preserving people with more facility in order, how comes it to pass the
first broachers of it were never upon record? There is scarce a false opinion vented in the world, but may,
as a stream, be traced to the first head and fountain. The inventors of particular forms of worship are
known; and the reasons why they prescribed them known; but what grandee was the author of this? Who
can pitch a time and person that sprung up this notion? If any be so insolent as to impose a cheat, he can
hardly be supposed to be so successful as to deceive the whole world for many ages: impostures pass not
free through the whole world without examination and discovery: falsities have not been universally and
constantly owned without control and question. If a cheat imposeth upon some towns and countries, he
will be found out by the more piercing inquiries of other places; and it is not easy to name any imposture
that hath walked so long in its disguise in the world, without being unmasked and whipped out by some
nation or other. If this had been a mere trick, there would have been as much craft in some to discern it as
there was in others to contrive it. No man can be imagined so wise in a kingdom, but others may be found
as wise as himself: and it is not conceivable, that so many clear-sighted men in all ages should be ignorant
of it, and not endeavour to free the world from so great a falsity. It cannot be found that a trick of state
should always beguile men of the most piercing insights, as well as the most credulous: that a few crafty
men should befool all the wise men in the world, and the world lie in a belief of it and never like to be
freed from it.36 What is the reason the succeeding politicians never knew this stratagem; since /their
maxims are usually handed to their successors.37
</p>
<p>
     This persuasion of the existence of God, owes not itself to any imposture or subtility of men: if it had
not been agreeable to common nature and reason, it could not so long have borne sway. The imposed
yoke would have been cast off by multitudes; men would not have charged themselves with that which
was attended with consequences displeasing to the flesh, and hindered them from a full swing of their
rebellious passions; such a shackle would have mouldered of itself, or been broke by the extravagances
human nature is inclined unto. The wickedness of men, without question, hath prompted them to
endeavour to unmask it, if it were a cosenage, but could never yet be so successful as to free the world
from a persuasion, or their own consciences from the tincture of the existence of a Deity. It must be
therefore of an ancienter date than the craft of statesmen, and descend into the world with the first
appearance of human nature. Time, which hath rectified many errors, improves this notion, makes it
shock down its roots deeper and spread its branches larger. It must be a natural truth that shines clear by
the detection of those errors that have befooled the world, and the wit of man is never able to name any
human author that first insinuated it into the beliefs of men.
</p>
<p>
     Thirdly, Nor was it fear first introduced it. Fear is the consequent of wickedness. As man was not
created with any inherent sin, so he was not created with any terrifying fears; the one had been against the
holiness of the Creator, the other against his goodness: fear did not make this opinion, but the opinion of
the being of a Deity was the cause of this fear, after his sense of angering the Deity by his wickedness.
The object of fear is before the act of fear; there could not be an act of fear exercised about the Deity, till
it was believed to be existent, and not only so, but offended: for God as existent only, is not the object of
fear or love; it is not the existence of a thing that excites any of those affections, but the relation a thing
bears to us in particular. God is good, and so the object of love, as well as just, and thereby the object of
fear. He was as much called Love,38 and Mens, or Mind, in regard of his goodness and understanding, by
the heathens, as much as by any other name. Neither of those names were proper to insinuate fear; neither
was fear the first principle that made the heathens worship a God; they offered sacrifices out of gratitude
to some, as well as to other, out of fear; the fear of evils in the world, and the hopes of relief and
assistance from their gods, and not a terrifying fear of God, was the principal spring of their worship.
When calamities from the hands of men, or judgments by the influences of Heaven were upon them, they
implored that which they thought a deity; it was not their fear of him, but a hope in his goodness, and
persuasion of remedy from him, for the averting those evils that rendered them adorers of a God: if they
had not had pre-existing notions of his being and goodness, they would never have made addresses to
him, or so frequently sought to that they only apprehended as a terrifying object.39 When you hear men
calling upon God in a time of affrighting thunder, you cannot imagine that the fear of thunder did first
introduce the notion of a God, but implies, that it was before apprehended by them, or stamped upon
them, though their fear doth at present actuate that belief, and engage them in a present exercise of piety;
and whereas the Scripture saith, “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,”40 or of all religion; it is
not understood of a distracted and terrifying fear, but a reverential fear of him, because of his holiness; or
a worship of him, a submission to him, and sincere seeking of him.
</p>
<p>
     Well, then, is it not a folly for an atheist to deny that which is the reason and common sentiment of the
whole world; to strip himself of humanity, run counter to his own conscience, prefer a private before an
universal judgment, give the lie to his own nature and reason, assert things impossible to be proved, nay,
impossible to be acted, forge irrationalities for the support of his fancy against the common persuasion of
the world, and against himself, and so much of God as is manifest in him and every man?41
</p>
<p>
     Reason II. It is a folly to deny that which all creatures or all things in the world manifest42 Let us view
this in Scripture, since we acknowledge it, and after consider the arguments from natural reason.
</p>
<p>
     The apostle resolves it (Rom. 1:19, 20), “The invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so
that they are without excuse.” They know, or might know, by the things that were made, the eternity and
power of God; their sense might take a circuit about every object, and their minds collect the being and
something of the perfections of the Deity. The first discourse of the mind upon the sight of a delicate
piece of workmanship, is the conclusion of the being of an artificer, and the admiration of his skill and
industry. The apostle doth not say, the invisible things of God are believed, or they have an opinion of
them, but they are seen, and clearly seen. They are like crystal glasses, which give a clear representation
of the existence of a Deity, like that mirror, reported to be in a temple in Arcadia, which represented to the
spectator, not his own face, but the image of that deity which he worshipped. The whole world is like a
looking-glass, which, whole and entire, represents the image of God, and every broken piece of it, every
little shred of a creature doth the like; not only the great ones, elephants and the leviathan, but ants, flies,
worms, whose bodies rather than names we know: the greater cattle and the creeping things (Gen. 1:24);
not naming there any intermediate creature, to direct us to view him in the smaller letters, as well as the
greater characters of the world. His name is “glorious,” and his attributes are excellent “in all the earth”43
in every creature, as the glory of the sun is in every beam and smaller flash; he is seen in every insect, in
every spire of grass. The voice of the Creator is in the most contemptible creature. The apostle adds, that
they are so clearly seen, that men are inexcusable if they have not some knowledge of God by them; if
they might not certainly know them, they might have some excuse: so that his existence is not only
probably, but demonstratively proved from the things of the world.44
</p>
<p>
     Especially the heavens declare him, which God “stretches out like a curtain,”45 or, as some render the
word, a “skin,” whereby is signified, that heaven is as an open book, which was anciently made of the
skins of beasts, that by the knowledge of them we may be taught the knowledge of God. Where Scripture
was not revealed, the world served for a witness of a God; whatever arguments the Scripture uses to prove
it, are drawn from nature (though, indeed, it doth not so much prove as suppose the existence of a God);
but what arguments it uses are from the creatures, and particularly the heavens, which are the public
preachers of this doctrine. The breath of God sounds to all the world through those organ-pipes. His being
is visible in their existence, his wisdom in their frame, his power in their motion, his goodness in their
usefulness. They have a voice, and their voice is as intelligible as any common language.46 And those are
so plain heralds of a Deity, that the heathen mistook them for deities, and gave them a particular
adoration, which was due to that God they declared. The first idolatry seems to be of those heavenly
bodies, which began probably in the time of Nimrod. In Job’s time it is certain they admired the glory of
the sun, and the brightness of the moon, not without kissing their hands, a sign of adoration.47 It is evident
a man may as well doubt whether there be a sun, when he sees his beams gilding the earth, as doubt
whether there be a God, when he sees his works spread in the world.
</p>
<p>
     The things in the world declare the existence of a God. 1. In their production. 2. Harmony. 3.
Preservation. 4. Answering their several ends.
</p>
<p>
     First, In their production. The declaration of the existence of God was the chief end for which they
were created, that the notion of a supreme and independent Eternal Being might easier incur into the
active understanding of man from the objects of sense, dispersed in every corner of the world, that he
might pay a homage and devotion to the Lord of all (Isa. 40:12, 13, 18, 19, &amp;c.), “Have you not
understood from the foundation of the earth, it is he that sits upon the circle of the heaven,” &amp;c. How
could this great heap be brought into being, unless a God had framed it? Every plant, every atom, as well
as every star, at the first meeting, whispers this in our ears, “I have a Creator; I am witness to a Deity.”
Who ever saw statues or pictures but presently thinks of a statuary and limner? Who beholds garments,
ships, or houses, but understands there was a weaver, a carpenter, an architect?48 Who can cast his eyes
about the world, but must think of that power that formed it, and that the goodness which appears in the
formation of it hath a perfect residence in some being? “Those things that are good must flow from
something perfectly good: that which is chief in any kind is the cause of all of that kind. Fire, which is
most hot, is the cause of all things which are hot. There is some being, therefore, which is the cause of all
that perfection which is in the creature; and this is God.” (Aquin. 1 qu. 2. Artic. 3.) All things that are
demonstrate something from whence they are. All things have a contracted perfection, and what they have
is communicated to them. Perfections are parcelled out among several creatures. Anything that is
imperfect cannot exist of itself. We are led, therefore, by them to consider a fountain which bubbles up in
all perfection; a hand which distributes those several degrees of being and perfection to what we see. We
see that which is imperfect; our minds conclude something perfect to exist before it. Our eye sees the
streams, but our understanding riseth to the head; as the eye sees the shadow, but the understanding
informs us whether it be the shadow of a man or of a beast.
</p>
<p>
    God hath given us sense to behold the objects in the world, and understanding to reason his existence
from them. The understanding cannot conceive a thing to have made itself; that is against all reason. As
they are made, they speak out a Maker,49 and cannot be a trick of chance, since they are made with such
an immense wisdom, that is too big for the grasp of all human understanding. Those that doubt whether
the existence of God be an implanted principle, yet agree that the effects in the world lead to a supreme
and universal cause; and that if we have not the knowledge of it rooted in our natures, yet we have it by
discourse; since, by all masters of reason, a processus in infinitum must be accounted impossible in
subordinate causes. This will appear in several things.
</p>
<p>
    I. The world and every creature had a beginning. The Scripture ascertains this to us.50 David, who was
not the first man, gives the praise to God of his being “curiously wrought,” &amp;c. (Ps. 139:14, 15.) God
gave being to men, and plants, and beasts, before they gave being to one another. He gives being to them
now as the Fountain of all being, though the several modes of being are from the several natures of second
causes.
</p>
<p>
    It is true, indeed, we are ascertained that they were made by the true God; that they were made by his
word; that they were made of nothing; and not only this lower world wherein we live, but, according to
the Jewish division, the world of men, the world of stars, and the world of spirits and souls. We do not
waver in it, or doubt of it, as the heathen did in their disputes; we know they are the workmanship of the
true God, of that God we adore, not of false gods; “by his word,” without any instrument or engine, as in
earthly structures; “of thngs which do not appear,” without any pre-existent matter, as all artificial works
of men are framed. Yet the proof of the beginning of the world is affirmed with good reason; and if it had
a beginning, it had also some higher cause than itself: every effect hath a cause.
</p>
<p>
    The world was not eternal, or from eternity.51 The matter of the world cannot be eternal. Matter cannot
subsist without form, nor put on any form without the action of some cause. This cause must be in being
before it acted; that which is not cannot act. The cause of the world must necessarily exist before any
matter was endued with any form; that, therefore, cannot be eternal before which another did subsist; if it
were from eternity, it would not be subject to mutation. If the whole was from eternity, why not also the
parts; what makes the changes so visible, then, if eternity would exempt it from mutability?
</p>
<p>
    1. Time cannot be infinite, and, therefore, the world not eternal. All motion hath its beginning; if it
were otherwise, we must say the number of heavenly revolutions of days and nights, which are past to this
instant, is actually infinite, which cannot be in nature.52 If it were so, it must needs be granted that a part is
equal to the whole; because infinite being equal to infinite, the number of days past, in all ages to the
beginning of one year being infinite (as they would be, supposing the world had no beginning) would by
consequence be equal to the number of days which shall pass to the end of the next; whereas that number
of days past is indeed but a part; and so a part would be equal to the whole.
</p>
<p>
    2. Generations of men, animals, and plants, could not be from eternity. If any man say the world was
from eternity, then there must be propagations of living creatures in the same manner as are at this day;
for without this the world could not consist.53 What we see now done must have been prepetually done, if
it be done by a necessity of nature; but we see nothing now that doth arise but by a mutual propagation
from another. If the world were eternal, therefore, it must be so in all eternity. Take any particular species.
Suppose a man, if men were from eternity; then there were perpetual generations—some were born into
the world, and some died. Now the natural condition of generation is, that a man doth not generate a man,
nor a sheep a lamb, as soon as ever itself is brought into the world; but get strength and vigor by degrees,
and must arrive to a certain stated age before they can produce the like; for whilst any thing is little and
below the due age, it cannot increase its kind. Men, therefore, and other creatures, did propagate their kind
by the same law, not as soon as ever they were born, but in the interval of some time; and children grew
up by degrees in the mother’s womb till they were fit to be brought forth. If this be so, then there could
not be an eternal succession of propagating; for there is no eternal continuation of time. Time is always to
be conceived as having one part before another; but that perpetuity of nativities is always after some time,
wherein it could note for the weakness of age. If no man, then, can conceive a propagation from eternity,
there must be then a beginning of generation in time, and, consequently, the creatures were made in time.
</p>
<p>
     “If the world were eternal, it must have been in the same posture as it is now, in a state of generation
and corruption; and so corruption must have been as eternal as generation, and then things that do
generate and corrupt must have eternally been and eternally not have been: there must be some first way
to set generation on work.”54 We must lose ourselves in our conceptions; we cannot conceive a father
before a child, as well as we cannot conceive a child before a father: and reason is quite bewildered, and
cannot return into a right way of conception, till it conceive one first of every kind: one first man, one first
animal, one first plant, from whence others do proceed. The argument is unanswerable, and the wisest
atheist (if any atheist can be called wise) cannot unloose the knot. We must come to something that is first
in every kind, and this first must have a cause, not of the same kind, but infinite and independent;
otherwise men run into inconceivable labyrinths and contradictions.
</p>
<p>
     Man, the noblest creature upon earth, hath a beginning. No man in the world but was some years ago
no man. If every man we see had a beginning, then the first man had also a beginning, then the world had
a beginning: for the earth, which was made for the use of man, had wanted that end for which it was
made. We must pitch upon some one man that was unborn; that first man must either be eternal; that
cannot be, for he that hath no beginning hath no end; or must spring out of the earth as plants and trees
do;55 that cannot be; why should not the earth produce men to this day, as it doth plants and trees? He was
therefore made; and whatsoever is made hath some cause that made it, which is God. If the world were
uncreated, it were then immutable, but every creature upon the earth is in a continual flux, always
changing:56 if things be mutable, they were created; if created, they were made by some author:
whatsoever hath a beginning must have a maker; if the world hath a beginning, there was then a time
when it was not; it must have some cause to produce it. That which makes is before that which is made,
and this is God.
</p>
<p>
     II. Which will appear further in this proposition, No creature can make itself; the world could not
make itself.
</p>
<p>
     If every man had a beginning, every man then was once nothing; he could not then make himself,
because nothing cannot be the cause of something; ‘The Lord he is God; he hath made us, and not we
ourselves.’ (Ps. 100:3.) Whatsoever begun in time was not; and when it was nothing, it had nothing, and
could do nothing; and therefore could never give to itself, nor to any other, to be, or to be able to do: for
then it gave what it had not, and did what it could not. Since reason must acknowledge a first of every
kind, a first man, &amp;c., it must acknowledge him created and made, not by himself:57 why have not other
men since risen up by themselves, not by chance? why hath not chance produced the like in that long time
the world hath stood? If we never knew anything give being to itself, how can we imagine anything ever
could? If the chiefest part of this lower world cannot, nor any part of it hath been known to give being to
itself, then the whole cannot be supposed to give any being to itself: man did not form himself; his body is
not from himself; it would then have the power of moving itself, but that it is not able to live or act
without the presence of the soul. Whilst the soul is present, the body moves; when that is absent, the body
lies as a senseless log, not having the least action or motion. His soul could not form itself. Can that which
cannot form the least mote, the least grain of dust, form itself a nobler substance than any upon the earth?
This will be evident to every man’s reason, if we consider,
</p>
<p>
     1. Nothing can act before it be. The first man was not, and therefore could not make himself to be. For
anything to produce itself is to act; if it acted before it was, it was then something and nothing at the same
time; it then had a being before it had a being; it acted when it brought itself into being. How could it act
without a being, without it was? So that if it were the cause of itself, it must be before itself as well as
after itself; it was before it was; it was as a cause before it was as an effect. Action always supposeth a
principle from whence it flows; as nothing hath no existence, so it hath no operation: there must be,
therefore, something of real existence to give a being to those things that are, and every cause must be an
effect of some other before it be a cause. To be and not to be at the same time, is a manifest contradiction,
which would be, if anything made itself. That which makes is always before that which is made. Who will
say the house is before the carpenter, or the picture before the limner? The world as a creator must be
before itself as a creature.
</p>
<p>
     2. That which doth not understand itself and order itself could not make itself. If the first man fully
understood his own nature, the excellency of his own soul, the manner of its operations, why was not that
understanding conveyed to his posterity? Are not many of them found, who understand their own nature,
almost as little as a beast understands itself; or a rose understands its own sweetness; or a tulip its own
colors? The Scripture, indeed, gives us an account how this came about, viz. by the deplorable rebellion
of man, whereby death was brought upon them (a spiritual death, which includes ignorance, as well as an
inability to spiritual action.58) Thus he fell from his honor, and became like the beasts that perish, and not
retaining God in his knowledge, retained not himself in his own knowledge.
</p>
<p>
     But what reply can an atheist make to it, who acknowledges no higher cause than nature? If the soul
made itself, how comes it to be so muddy, so wanting in its knowledge of itself, and of other things? If the
soul made its own understanding, whence did the defect arise? If some first principle was settled by the
first man in himself, where was the stop that he did not implant all in his own mind, and, consequently in
the minds of all his descendants? Our souls know little of themselves, little of the world, are every day
upon new inquiries, have little satisfaction in themselves, meet with many an invincible rub in their way,
and when they seem to come to some resolution in some cases, stagger again, and, like a stone rolled up
to the top of the hill, quickly find themselves again at the foot. How come they to be so purblind in truth?
so short of that which they judge true goodness? How comes it to pass they cannot order their own
rebellious affections, and suffer the reins they have to hold over their affections to be taken out of their
hands by the unruly fancy and flesh? This no man that denies the being of a God, and the revelation in
Scripture, can give an account of. Blessed be God that we have the Scripture, which gives us an account
of those things, that all the wit of men could never inform us of; and that when they are discovered and
known by revelation, they appear not contrary to reason!
</p>
<p>
     3. If the first man made himself, how came he to limit himself? If he gave himself being, why did he
not give himself all the perfections and ornaments of being? Nothing that made itself could sit down
contented with a little, but would have had as much power to give itself that which is less, as to give itself
being, when it was nothing. The excellences it wanted had not been more difficult to gain than the other
which it possessed, as belonging to its nature. If the first man had been independent upon another, and had
his perfection from himself, he might have acquired that perfection he wanted as well as have bestowed
upon himself that perfection he had; and then there would have been no bounds set to him. He would have
been omniscient and immutable. He might have given himself what he would; if he had had the setting his
own bounds, he would have set none at all; for what should restrain him? No man now wants ambition to
be what he is not; and if the first man had not been determined by another, but had given himself being,
he would not have remained in that determinate being, no more than a toad would remain a toad, if it had
power to make itself a man, and that power it would have had, if it had given itself a being. Whatsoever
gives itself being, would give itself all degrees of being, and so would have no imperfection, because
every imperfection is a want of some degree of being. He that could give himself matter and life, might
give himself everything.59 The giving of life is an act of omnipotence; and what is omnipotent in one
thing may be in all. Besides, if the first man had made himself, he would have conveyed himself to all his
posterity in the same manner; every man would have had all the perfections of the first man, as every
creature hath the perfections of the same kind, from whence it naturally issues; all are desirous to
communicate what they can to their posterity. Communicative goodness belongs to every nature. Every
plant propagates its kind in the same perfection it hath itself; and the nearer anything comes to a rational
nature, the greater affection it hath to that which descends from it; therefore this affection belongs to a
rational nature much more. The first man, therefore, if he had had power to give himself being, and,
consequently, all perfection, he would have had as much power to convey it down to his posterity; no
impediment could have stopped his way; then all souls proceeding from that first man would have been
equally intellectual. What should hinder them from inheriting the same perfections? Whence should they
have divers qualifications and differences in their understandings? No man then would have been subject
to those weaknesses, doubtings, and unsatisfied desires of knowledge and perfection. But being all souls
are not alike, it is certain they depend upon some other cause for the communication of that excellency
they have. If the perfections of man be so contracted and kept within certain bounds, it is certain that they
were not in his own power, and so were not from himself. Whatsoever hath a determinate being must be
limited by some superior cause. There is, therefore, some superior power, that hath thus determined the
creature by set bounds and distinct measures, and hath assigned to every one its proper nature, that it
should not be greater or less than it is; who hath said of every one as of the waves of the sea, “Hitherto
shalt thou come, but no further”60 and this is God. Man could not have reserved any perfection from his
posterity; for since he doth propagate not by choice, but nature, he could no more have kept back any
perfection from them, than he could, as he pleased, have given any perfection belonging to his nature to
them.
</p>
<p>
     4. That which hath power to give itself being, cannot want power to preserve that being. Preservation
is not more difficult than creation. If the first man made himself, why did he not preserve himself? He is
not now among the living in the world. How came he to be so feeble as to sink into the grave? Why did he
not inspire himself with new heat and moisture, and fill his languishing limbs and declining body with
new strength? Why did he not chase away diseases and death at the first approach? What creature can find
the dust of the first man? All his posterity traverse the stage and retire again; in a short space their age
departs, and is removed from them ‘as a shepherd’s tent,’ and is ‘cut off with pining sickness.’61 ‘The life
of man is as a wind, and like a cloud that is consumed and vanishes away. The eye that sees him shall see
him no more; he returns not to his house, neither doth his place know him any more.’62 The Scripture
gives us the reason of this, and lays it upon the score of sin against his Creator, which no man without
revelation can give any satisfactory account of. Had the first man made himself, he had been sufficient for
himself, able to support himself without the assistance of any creature. He would not have needed animals
and plants, and other helps to nourish and refresh him, nor medicines to cure him. He could not be
beholden to other things for his support, which he is certain he never made for himself. His own nature
would have continued that vigor, which once he had conferred upon himself. He would not have needed
the heat and light of the sun; he would have wanted nothing sufficient for himself in himself; he needed
not have sought without himself for his own preservation and comfort. What depends upon another is not
of itself; and what depends upon things inferior to itself is less of itself. Since nothing can subsist of itself,
since we see those things upon which man depends for his nourishment and subsistence, growing and
decaying, starting into the world and retiring from it, as well as man himself; some preserving cause must
be concluded, upon which all depends.

<p>
     5. If the first man did produce himself, why did be not produce himself before?
</p>
<p>
     It hath been already proved, that he had a beginning, and could not be from eternity. Why then did he
not make himself before? Not because he would not. For having no being, he could have no will; he could
neither be willing nor not willing. If he could not then, how could he afterwards? If it were in his own
power, he could have done it, he would have done it; if it were not in his own power, then it was in the
power of some other cause, and that is God. How came he by that power to produce himself? If the power
of producing himself were communicated by another, then man could not be the cause of himself. That is
the cause of it which communicated that power to it. But if the power of being was in and from himself
and in no other, nor communicated to him, man would always have been in act, and always have existed;
no hindrance can be conceived. For that which had the power of being in itself was invincible by anything
that should stand in the way of its own being.
</p>
<p>
     We may conclude from hence, the excellency of the Scripture; that it is a word not to be refused
credit. It gives us the most rational account of things in the 1st and 2d of Genesis, which nothing in the
world else is able to do.
</p>
<p>
     III. No creature could make the world. No creature can create another. If it creates of nothing, it is
then omnipotent and so not a creature. If it makes something of matter unfit for that which is produced out
of it, then the inquiry will be, Who was the cause of the matter? and so we must arrive to some uncreated
being, the cause of all. Whatsoever gives being to any other must be the highest being, and must possess
all the perfections of that which it gives being to. What visible creature is there which possesses the
perfections of the whole world? If therefore an invisible creature made the world, the same inquiries will
return whence that creature had its being? for he could not make himself. If any creature did create the
world, he must do it by the strength and virtue of another, which first gave him being, and this is God. For
whatsoever hath its existence and virtue of acting from another, is not God. If it hath its virtue from
another, it is then a second cause, and so supposeth a first cause. It must have some cause of itself, or be
eternally existent. If eternally existent, it is not a second cause, but God; if not eternally existent, we must
come to something at length which was the cause of it, or else be bewildered without being able to give an
account of anything. We must come at last to an infinite, eternal, independent Being, that was the first
cause of this structure and fabric wherein we and all creatures dwell. The Scripture proclaims this aloud,
“I am the Lord and there is none else: I form the light, and I create darkness.”63 Man, the noblest creature,
cannot of himself make a man, the chiefest part of the world. If our parents only, without a superior
power, made our bodies or souls, they would know the frame of them; as he that makes a lock knows the
wards of it; he that makes any curious piece of arras, knows how he sets the various colors together, and
how many threads went to each division in the web; he that makes a watch, having the idea of the whole
work in his mind, knows the motions of it, and the reason of those motions. But both parents and children
are equally ignorant of the nature of their souls and bodies, and of the reason of their motions. God only,
that had the supreme hand in forming us, in whose “book all our members are written, which in
continuance were fashioned,”64 knows what we all are ignorant of. If man hath in an ordinary course of
generation his being chiefly from a higher cause than his parents, the world then certainly had its being
from some infinitely wise intelligent Being, which is God. If it were, as some fancy, made by an assembly
of atoms, there must be some infinite intelligent cause that made them, some cause that separated them,
some cause that mingled them together for the piling up so comely a structure as the world. It is the most
absurd thing to think they should meet together by hazard, and rank themselves in that order we see,
without a higher and a wise agent. So that no creature could make the world. For supposing any creature
was formed before this visible world, and might have a hand in disposing things, yet he must have a cause
of himself, and must act by the virtue and strength of another, and this is God.
</p>
<p>
     IV. From hence it follows, that there is a first cause of things, which we call God. There must be
something supreme in the order of nature, something which is greater than all, which hath nothing beyond
it or above it, otherwise we must run in infinitum. We see not a river, but we conclude a fountain; a watch,
but we conclude an artificer. As all number begins from unity, so all the multitude of things in the world
begins from some unity, oneness as the principle of it. It is natural to arise from a view of those things, to
the conception of a nature more perfect than any. As from heat mixed with cold, and light mixed with
darkness, men conceive and arise in their understandings to an intense heat and a pure light; and from a
corporeal or bodily substance joined with an incorporeal, (as man is an earthly body and a spiritual soul,
we ascend to a conception of a substance pure incorporeal and spiritual: so from a multitude of things in
the word, reason leads us to one choice being above all. And since in all natures in the world, we still find
a superior nature; the nature of one beast, above the nature of another; the nature of man above the nature
of beasts; and some invisible nature, the worker of strange effects in the air and earth, which cannot be
ascribed to any visible cause, we must suppose some nature above all those, of unconceivable perfection.
</p>
<p>
     Every skeptic, one that doubts whether there be anything real or no in the world, that counts
everything an appearance, must necessarily own a first cause.65 They cannot reasonably doubt, but that
there is some first cause which makes the things appear so to them. They cannot be the cause of their own
appearance. For as nothing can have a being from itself, so nothing can appear by itself and its own force.
Nothing can be and not be at the same time. But that which is not and yet seems to be; if it be the cause
why it seems to be what it is not, it may be said to be and not to be. But certainly such persons must think
themselves to exist. If they do not, they cannot think; and if they do exist, they must have some cause of
that existence. So that which way soever we turn ourselves, we must in reason own a first cause of the
world. Well then might the Psalmist term an atheist a fool, that disowns a God against his own reason.
Without owning a God as the first cause of the world, no man can give any tolerable or satisfactory
account of the world to his own reason. And this first cause,
</p>
<p>
     1. Must necessarily exist. It is necessary that He by whom all things are, should be before all things,
and nothing before him.66 And if nothing be before him, he comes not from any other; and then he always
was, and without beginning. He is from himself; not that he once was not, but because he hath not his
existence from another, and therefore of necessity he did exist from all eternity. Nothing can make itself,
or bring itself into being; therefore there must be some being which hath no cause, that depends upon no
other, never was produced by any other, but was what he is from eternity, and cannot be otherwise; and is
not what he is by will, but nature, necessarily existing, and always existing without any capacity or
possibility ever not to be.
</p>
<p>
     2. Must be infinitely perfect. Since man knows he is an imperfect being, he must suppose the
perfections he wants are seated in some other being which hath limited him, and upon which he depends.
Whatsoever we conceive of excellency or perfection, must be in God. For we can conceive no perfection
but what God hath given us a power to conceive. And he that gave us a power to conceive a transcendent
perfection above whatever we saw or heard of, hath much more in himself; else he could not give us such
a conception.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, As the production of the world, so the harmony of all the parts of it declare the being and
wisdom of a God. Without the acknowledging God, the atheist can give no account of those things. The
multitude, elegancy, variety, and beauty of all things are steps whereby to ascend to one fountain and
original of them. Is it not a folly to deny the being of a wise agent, who sparkles in the beauty and
motions of the heavens, rides upon the wings of the wind, and is writ upon the flowers and fruits of
plants? As the cause is known by the effects, so the wisdom of the cause is known by the elegancy of the
work, the proportion of the parts to one another. Who can imagine the world could be rashly made, and
without consultation, which, in every part of it, is so artificially framed? No work of art springs up of its
own accord.67 The world is framed by an excellent art, and, therefore, made by some skilful artist. As we
hear not a melodious instrument, but we conclude there is a musician that touches it, as well as some
skilful hand that framed and disposed it for those lessons; and no man that hears the pleasant sound of a
lute but will fix his thoughts, not upon the instrument itself, but upon the skill of the artist that made it,
and the art of the musician that strikes it, though he should not see the first, when he saw the lute, nor see
the other, when he hears the harmony: so a rational creature confines not his thoughts to his sense when
he sees the sun in its glory, and the moon walking in its brightness; but riseth up in a contemplation and
admiration of that Infinite Spirit that composed, and filled them with such sweetness. This appears,
</p>
<p>
     1. In the linking contrary qualities together. All things are compounded of the elements. Those are
endued with contrary qualities, dryness and moisture, heat and cold. These would always be contending
with and infesting one another’s rights, till the contest ended in the destruction of one or both. Where fire
is predominant, it would suck up the water; where water is prevalent, it would quench the fire. The heat
would wholly expel the cold, or the cold overpower the heat, yet we see them chained and linked one
within another in every body upon the earth, and rendering mutual offices for the benefit of that body
wherein they are seated, and all conspiring together in their particular quarrels for the public interest of
the body. How could those contraries, that of themselves observe no order, that are always preying upon
one another, jointly accord together of themselves, for one common end, if they were not linked in a
common band, and reduced to that order by some incomprehensible wisdom and power, which keeps a
hand upon them, orders their motions and directs their events, and makes them friendly pass into one
another’s natures? Confusion had been the result of the discord and diversity of their natures; no
composition could have been of those conflicting qualities for the frame of any body, nor any harmony
arose from so many jarring strings, if they had not been reduced into concord by one that is supreme Lord
over them, and knows how to dispose their varieties and enmities for the public good. If a man should see
a large city or country, consisting of great multitudes of men, of different tempers, full of frauds, and
factions, and animosities in their natures against one another, yet living together in good order and peace,
without oppressing and invading one another, and joining together for the public good, he would presently
conclude there were some excellent governor, who tempered them by his wisdom, and reserved the public
peace, though he had never yet beheld him with his eye.68 It is as necessary to conclude a God, who
moderates the contrarieties in the world, as to conclude a wise prince who overrules the contrary
dispositions in a state, making every one to keep his own bounds and confines. Things that are contrary to
one another subsist in an admirable order.
</p>
<p>
     2. In the subserviency of one thing to another. All the members of living creatures are curiously fitted
for the service of one another, destined to a particular end, and endued with a virtue to attain that end, and
so distinctly placed, that one is no hindrance to the other in its operations.69 Is not this more admirable
than to be the work of chance, which is incapable to settle such an order, and fix particular and general
ends, causing an exact correspondency of all the parts with one another, and every part to conspire
together for one common end? One thing is fitted for another. The eye is fitted for the sun, and the sun
fitted for the eye. Several sorts of food are fitted for several creatures, and those creatures fitted with
organs for the partaking that food.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) Subserviency of heavenly bodies. The sun, the heart of the world, is not for itself, but for the good
of the world, as the heart of man is for the good of the body.70 How conveniently is the sun placed, at a
distance from the earth, and the upper heavens, to enlighten the stars above, and enliven the earth below!
If it were either higher or lower, one part would want its influences. It is not in the higher parts of the
heavens; the earth, then, which lives and fructifies by its influence would have been exposed to a
perpetual winter and chillness, unable to have produced anything for the sustenance of man or beast. If
seated lower, the earth had been parched up, the world made uninhabitable, and long since had been
consumed to ashes by the strength of its heat. Consider the motion, as well as the situation of the sun. Had
it stood still, one part of the world had been cherished by its beams, and the other left in a desolate
widowhood, in a disconsolate darkness. Besides, the earth would have had no shelter from its
perpendicular beams striking perpetually, and without any remission, upon it. The same incommodities
would have followed upon its fixedness as upon its too great nearness. By a constant day, the beauty of
the stars had been obscured, the knowledge of their motions been prevented, and a considerable part of
the glorious wisdom of the Creator, in those choice “works of his finders,”71 had been veiled from our
eyes. It moves in a fixed line, visits all parts of the earth, scatters in the day its refreshing blessings in
every creek of the earth, and removes the mask from the other beauties of heaven in the night, which
sparkle out to the glory of the Creator. It spreads its light, warms the earth, cherisheth the seeds, excites
the spirit in the earth, and brings fruit to maturity. View also the air, the vast, extent between heaven and
earth, which serves for a water-course, a cistern for water, to bedew the face of the sun-burnt earth, to
satisfy the desolate ground, and to cause the ‘bud of the tender herb to spring forth.’72 Could chance
appoint the clouds of the air to interpose as fans between the scorching heat of the sun, and the faint
bodies of the creatures? Can that be the ‘father of the rain, or beget the drops of dew?’73 Could anything
so blind settle those ordinances of heaven for the preservation of creatures on the earth? Can this either
bring or stay the bottles of heaven, when the ‘dust grows into hardness, and the clouds cleave fast
together?’74
</p>
<p>
     (2.) Subserviency of the lower world, the earth, and sea, which was created to be inhabited, (Isa.
45:18.) The sea affords water to the rivers, the rivers, like so many veins, are spread through the whole
body of the earth, to refresh and enable it to bring forth fruit for the sustenance of man and beast, (Ps.
104:10, 11.) “He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills; they give drink to every
beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and the
herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth.” (ver. 14.) The trees are
provided for shades against the extremity of heat, a refuge for the panting beasts, an “habitation for birds,”
wherein to make their nests (ver. 17), and a basket for their provision. How are the valleys and mountains
of the earth disposed for the pleasure and profit of man! Every year are the fields covered with harvests
for the nourishing the creatures; no part is baren, but beneficial to man. The mountains that are not clothed
with grass for his fool, are set with stones to make him an habitation; they have their peculiar services of
metals and minerals, for the conveniency and comfort, and benefit of man. Things which are not fit for his
food, are medicines for his cure, under some painful sickness. Where the earth brings not forth corn, it
brings forth roots for the service of other creatures. Wood abounds more in those countries where the cold
is stronger than in others. Can this be the result of chance, or not rather of an Infinite Wisdom? Consider
the usefulness of the sea, for the supply of rivers to refresh the earth: “Which go up by the mountains and
down by the valleys into the place God hath founded for them” (Ps. 104:8): a store-house for fish, for the
nourishment of other creatures, a shop of medicines for cure, and pearls for ornament: the band that ties
remote nations together, by giving opportunity of passage to, and commerce with, one another. How
should that natural inclination of the sea to cover the earth, submit to this subserviency to the creatures?
Who hath pounded in this fluid mass of water in certain limits, and confined it to its own channel, for the
accommodation of such creatures, who, by its common law, can only be upon the earth? Naturally the
earth was covered with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. “Who set a
bound that they might not pass over,”75 that they return not again to cover the earth? Was it blind chance
or an Infinite Power, that “shut up the sea with doors, and made thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
and said, Hitherto shall thou come and no farther, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?”76 All things
are so ordered, that they are not propter se, but propter aliud. What advantage accrues to the sun by its
unwearied rolling about the world? Doth it increase the perfection of its nature by all its circuits? No; but
it serves the inferior world, it impregnates things by its heat. Not the most abject thing but hath its end and
use. There is a straight connection: the earth could not bring forth fruit without the heavens; the heavens
could not water the earth without vapors from it.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) All this subserviency of creatures centres in man. Other creatures are served by those things, as
well as ourselves, and they are provided for their nourishment and refreshment, as well as ours;77 yet, both
they, and all creatures meet in man, as lines in their centres. Things that have no life or sense, are made
for those that have both life and sense; and those that have life and sense, are made for those that are
endued with reason. When the Psalmist admiringly considers the heavens, moon and stars, he intimates
man to be the end for which they were created (Ps. 8:3, 4): “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?”
He expresseth more particularly the dominion that man hath “over the beasts of the field, the fowl of the
air, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea” (ver. 6–8); and concludes from thence, the
“excellency of God’s name in all the earth.” All things in the world, one way or other, centre in an
usefulness for man; some to feed him, some to clothe him, some to delight him, others to instruct him,
some to exercise his wit, and others his strength. Since man did not make them, he did not also order them
for his own use. If they conspire to serve him who never made them, they direct man to acknowledge
another, who is the joint Creator both of the lord and the servants under his dominion; and, therefore, as
the inferior natures are ordered by an invisible hand for the good of man, so the nature of man is, by the
same hand, ordered to acknowledge the existence and the glory of the Creator of him. This visible order
man knows he did not constitute; he did not settle those creatures in subserviency to himself; they were
placed in that order before he had any acquaintance with them, or existence of himself; which is a
question God puts to Job, to consider of (Job 38:4): “Where wast thou when I laid the foundation of the
earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.” All is ordered for man’s use; the heavens answer to the earth,
as a roof to a floor, both composing a delightful habitation for man; vapors ascend from the earth, and the
heaven concocts them, and returns them back in welcome showers for the supplying of the earth.78 The
light of the sun descends to beautify the earth, and employs its heat to midwife its fruits, and this for the
good of the community, whereof man is the head; and though all creatures have distinct natures, and must
act for particular ends, according to the law of their creation, yet there is a joint combination for the good
of the whole, as the common end; just as all the rivers in the world, from what part soever they come,
whether north or south, fall into the sea, for the supply of that mass of waters, which loudly proclaims
some infinitely wise nature, who made those things in so exact an harmony. “As in a clock, the hammer
which strikes the bell leads us to the next wheel, that to another, the little wheel to a greater, whence it
derives its motion, this at last to the spring, which acquaints us that there was some artist that framed them
in this subordination to one another for this orderly motion.”79
</p>
<p>
     (4.) This order or subserviency is regular and uniform; everything is determined to its particular
nature.80 The sun and moon day and night, months and years, determine the seasons, never are defective
in coming back to their station and place; they wander not from their roads, shock not against one another,
nor hinder one another in the functions assigned them. From a small grain or seed, a tree springs, with
body, root, bark, leaves, fruit of the same shape, figure, smell, taste; that there should be as many parts in
one, as in all of the same kind, and no more; and that in the womb of a sensitive creature should be
formed one of the same kind, with all the due members, and no more; and the creature that produceth it
knows not how it is formed, or how it is perfected. If we say this is nature, this nature is an intelligent
being; if not, how can it direct all causes to such uniform ends? if it be intelligent, this nature must be the
same we call God, “who ordered every herb to yield seed, and every fruit tree to yield fruit after its kind,
and also every beast, and every creeping thing after its kind.” (Gen. 1:11, 12, 24.) And everything is
determined to its particular season; the sap riseth from the root at its appointed time, enlivening and
clothing the branches with a new garment at such a time of the sun’s returning, not wholly hindered by
any accidental coldness of the weather, it being often colder at its return, than it was at the sun’s
departure. All things have their seasons of flourishing, budding, blossoming, bringing forth fruit; they
ripen in their seasons, cast their leaves at the same time, throw off their old clothes, and in the spring
appear with new garments, but still in the same fashion. The winds and the rain have their seasons, and
seem to be administered by laws for the profit of man.81 No satisfactory cause of those things can be
ascribed to the earth, the sea, or the air, or stars. “Can any understand the spreading of his clouds, or the
noise of his tabernacle?” (Job 38:29.) The natural reason of those things cannot be demonstrated, without
recourse to an infinite and intelligent being; nothing can be rendered capable of the direction of those
things but a God.
</p>
<p>
     This regularity in plants and animals is in all nations. The heavens have the same motion in all parts of
the world; all men have the same law of nature in their mind; all creatures are stamped with the same law
of creation. In all parts the same creatures serve for the same use; and though there be different creatures
in India and Europe, yet they have the same subordination, the same subserviency to one another, and
ultimately to man; which shows that there is a God, and but one God, who tunes all those different strings
to the same notes in all places. Is it nature merely conducts these natural causes in due measure to their
proper effects, without interfering with one another? Can mere nature be the cause of those musical
proportions of time? You may as well conceive a lute to sound its own strings without the hand of an
artist; a city well governed without a governor; an army keep its stations without a general, as imagine so
exact an order without an orderer. Would any man, when he hears a clock strike, by fit intervals, the hour
of the day, imagine this regularity in it without the direction of one that had understanding to manage it?
He would not only regard the motion of the clock, but commend the diligence of the clockkeeper.
</p>
<p>
     (5.) This order and subserviency is constant. Children change the customs and manners of their
fathers; magistrates change the laws they have received from their ancestors, and enact new ones in their
room: but in the world all things consist as they were created at the beginning; the law of nature in the
creatures hath met with no change. Who can behold the sun rising in the morning, the moon shining in the
night, increasing and decreasing in its due spaces, the stars in their regular motions night after night, for
all ages, and yet deny a President over them?82 And this motion of the heavenly bodies, being contrary to
the nature of other creatures, who move in order to rest, must be from some higher cause. But those, ever
since the settling in their places, have been perpetually rounding the world. What nature, but one powerful
and intelligent, could give that perpetual motion to the sun,83 which being bigger than the earth a hundred
sixty-six times, runs many thousand miles with a mighty swiftness in the space of an hour, with an
unwearied diligence per forming its daily task, and, as a strong man, rejoicing to run its race, for above
five thousand years together, without intermission, but in the time of Joshua?84 It is not nature’s sun, but
God’s sun, which he ‘makes to rise upon the just and unjust.’85 So a plant receives its nourishment from
the earth, sends forth the juice to every branch, forms a bud which spreads it into a blossom and flower;
the leaves of this drop off, and leave a fruit of the same color and taste, every year, which, being ripened
by the sun, leaves seeds behind it for the propagation of its like, which contains in the nature of it the
same kind of buds, blossoms, fruit, which were before; and being nourished in the womb of the earth, and
quickened by the power of the sun, discovers itself at length, in all the progresses and motions which its
predecessor did. Thus in all ages, in all places, every year it performs the same task, spins out fruit of the
same color, taste, virtue, to refresh the several creatures for which they are provided. This settled state of
things comes from that God who laid the “foundations of the earth,” that it should “not be removed”
forever;86 and set “ordinances for them” to act by a stated law;87 according to which they move as if they
understood themselves to have made a covenant with their Creator.88
</p>
<p>
     3. Add to this union of contrary qualities, and the subserviency of one thing to another, the admirable
variety and diversity of things in the world. What variety of metals, living creatures, plants! what variety
and distinction in the shape of their leaves, flowers, smell, resulting from them! Who can number up the
several sorts of beasts on the earth, birds in the air, fish in the sea? How various are their motions! Some
creep, some go, some fly, some swim; and in all this variety each creature hath organs or members, fitted
for their peculiar motion. If you consider the multitude of stars, which shine like jewels in the heavens,
their different magnitudes, or the variety of colors in the flowers and tapestry of the earth, you could no
more conclude they made themselves, or were made by chance, than you can imagine a piece of arras,
with a diversity of figures and colors, either wove itself, or were knit together by hazard.
</p>
<p>
    How delicious is the sap of the vine, when turned into wine, above that of a crab! Both have the same
womb of earth to conceive them, both agree in the nature of wood and twigs, as channels to con it into
fruit. What is that which makes the one so sweet, the other so sour, or makes that sweet which was a few
weeks before unpleasantly sharp? Is it the earth? No: they both have the same soil; the branches may
touch each other; the strings of their roots may, under ground, entwine about one another. Is it the sun?
both have the same beams. Why is not the taste and color of the one as gratifying as the other? Is it the
root? the taste of that is far different from that of the fruit it bears. Why do they not, when they have the
same soil, the same sun, and stand near one another, borrow something from one another’s natures? No
reason can be rendered, but that there is a God of infinite wisdom hath determined this variety, and bound
up the nature of each creature within itself. “Everything follows the law of its creation; and it is worthy
observation, that the Creator of them hath not given that power to animals, which arise from different
species, to propagate the like to themselves; as mules, that arise from different species. No reason can be
rendered of this, but the fixed determination of the Creator, that those species which were created by him
should not be lost in those mixtures which are contrary to the law of the creation?89 This cannot possibly
be ascribed to that which is commonly called nature, but unto the God of nature, who will not have his
creatures exceed their bounds or come short of them.
</p>
<p>
    Now since among those varieties there are some things better than other, yet all are good in their kind,
and partake of goodness,90 there must be something better and more excellent than all those, from whom
they derive that goodness, which inheres in their nature and is communicated by them to others: and this
excellent Being must inherit, in an eminent way in his own nature, the goodness of all those varieties,
since they made not themselves, but were made by another. All that goodness which is scattered in those
varieties must be infinitely concentered in that nature, which distributed those various perfections to them
(Ps. 104:9): “He that planted the ear, shall not he hear; he that formed the eye, shall not he see; he that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?” The Creator is greater than the creature, and whatsoever is
in his effects, is but an impression of some excellenty in himself: there is, therefore, some chief fountain
of goodness whence all those various goodnesses in the world do flow.
</p>
<p>
    From all this it follows, if there be an order, and harmony, there must be an Orderer: one that “made
the earth by his power, established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his
discretion” (Jer. 10:12). Order being the effect, cannot be the cause of itself: order is the disposition of
things to an end, and is not intelligent, but implies an intelligent Orderer; and, therefore, it is as certain
that there is a God, as it is certain there is order in the world. Order is an effect of reason and counsel; this
reason and counsel must have its residence in some being before this order was fixed: the things ordered
are always distinct from that reason and counsel whereby they are ordered, and also after it, as the effect
is after the cause. No man begins a piece of work but he hath the model of it in his own mind: no man
builds a house, or makes a watch, but he hath the idea or copy of it in his own head. This beautiful world
bespeaks an idea of it, or a model: since there is such a magnificent wisdom in the make of each creature,
and the proportion of one creature to another, this model must be before the world, as the pattern is
always before the thing that is wrought by it. This, therefore, must be in some intelligent and wise agent,
and this is God. Since the reason of those things exceed the reason and all the art of man, who can ascribe
them to any inferior cause? Chance it could not be; the motions of chance are not constant, and at set
seasons, as the motions of creatures are. That which is by chance is contingent, this is necessary;
uniformity can never be the birth of chance. Who can imagine that all the parts of a watch can meet
together and put themselves in order and motion by chance? “Nor can it be nature only, which indeed is a
disposition of second causes. If nature hath not an understanding, it cannot work such effects. If nature
therefore uses counsel to begin a thing, reason to dispose it, art to effect it, virtue to complete it, and
power to govern it, why should it be called nature rather than God”91 Nothing so sure as that which hath
an end to which it tends, hath a cause by which it is ordered to that end. Since therefore all things are
ordered in subserviency to the good of man, they are so ordered by Him that made both man and them;
and man must acknowledge the wisdom and goodness of his Creator, and act in subserviency to his glory,
as other creatures act in subserviency to his good. Sensible objects were not made only to gratify the sense
of man, but to hand something to his mind as he is a rational creature: to discover God to him as an object
of love and desire to be enjoyed. If this be not the effect of it, the order of the creature, as to such an one,
is in vain, and falls short of its true end.92
</p>
<p>
     To conclude this: As when a man comes into a palace, built according to the exactest rule of art, and
with an unexceptionable conveniency for the inhabitants, he would acknowledge both the being and skill
of the builder; so whosoever shall observe the disposition of all the parts of the world, their connection,
comeliness, the variety of seasons, the swarms of different creatures, and the mutual offices they render to
one another, cannot conclude less, than that it was contrived by an infinite skill, effected by infinite
power, and governed by infinite wisdom. None can imagine a ship to be orderly conducted without a
pilot; nor the parts of the world to perform their several functions without a wise guide; considering the
members of the body cannot perform theirs, without the active presence of the soul. The atheist, then, is a
fool to deny that which every creature in his constitution asserts, and thereby renders himself unable to
give a satisfactory account of that constant uniformity in the motions of the creatures.
</p>
<p>
     Thirdly, As the production and harmony, so particular creatures, pursuing and attaining their ends,
manifest that there is a God. All particular creatures have natural instincts, which move them for some
end. The intending of an end is a property of a rational creature; since the lower creatures cannot
challenge that title, they must act by the understanding and direction of another; and since man cannot
challenge the honor of inspiring the creatures with such instincts, it must be ascribed to some nature
infinitely above any creature in understanding. No creature doth determine itself. Why do the fruits and
grain of the earth nourish us, when the earth which instrumentally gives them that fitness, cannot nourish
us, but because their several ends are determined by one higher than the world?
</p>
<p>
     1. Several creatures have several natures. How soon will all creatures, as soon as they see the light,
move to that whereby they must live, and make use of the natural arms God hath given their kind, for their
defence, before they are grown to any maturity to afford them that defence! The Scripture makes the
appetite of infants to their milk a foundation of the divine glory, (Ps. 8:3), “Out of the mouths of babes
and sucklings hast thou ordained strength” that is, matter of praise and acknowledgment of God, in the
natural appetite they have to their milk and their relish of it. All creatures have a natural affection to their
young ones; all young ones by a natural instinct, move to, and receive the nourishment that is proper for
them; some are their own physicians, as well as their own caterers, and naturally discern what preserves
them in life, and what restores them when sick. The swallow flies to its celandine, and the toad hastens to
its plantain. Can we behold the spider’s nets, or silkworm’s web, the bee’s closets, or the ant’s granaries,
without acknowledging a higher being than a creature who hath planted that genius in them? The
consideration of the nature of several creatures God commended to Job, (chap. 39, where he discourseth
to Job of the natural instincts of the goat, the ostrich, horse, and eagle, &amp;c.) to persuade him to the
acknowledgment and admiration of God, and humiliation of himself. The spider, as if it understood the art
of weaving, fits its web both for its own habitation, and a net to catch its prey. The bee builds a cell which
serves for chambers to reside in, and a repository for its provision. Birds are observed to build their nests
with a clammy matter without, for the firmer duration of it, and with a soft moss and down within, for the
conveniency and warmth of their young. “The stork knows his appointed time,” (Jer. 8:7), and the
swallows observe the time of their coming; they go an return according to the seasons of the year; this
they gain not by consideration, it descends to them with their nature; they neither gain nor increase it by
rational deductions. It is not in vain to speak of these. How little do we improve by meditation those
objects which daily offer themselves to our view, full of instructions for us! And our Saviour sends his
disciples to spell God in the lilies.93 It is observed also, that the creatures offensive to man go single; if
they went by troops, they would bring destruction upon man and beast; this is the nature of them, for the
preservation of others.
</p>
<p>
     2. They know not their end. They have a law in their natures, but have no rational understanding,
either of the end to which they are appointed, or the means fit to attain it; they naturally do what they do,
and move by no counsel of their own, but by a law impressed by some higher hand upon their natures.
What plant knows why it strikes its root into the earth? doth it understand what storms it is to contest
with? Or why it shoots up its branches towards heaven? doth it know it needs the droppings of the clouds
to preserve itself, and make it fruitful? These are acts of understanding; the root is downward to preserve
its own standing, the branches upward to preserve other creatures; this understanding is not in the creature
itself, but originally in another. Thunders and tempests know not why they are sent; yet by the direction of
a mighty hand, they are instruments of justice upon a wicked world. Rational creatures that act for some
end, and know the end they aim at, yet know not the manner of the natural motion of the members to it.94
When we intend to look upon a thing, we take no counsel about the natural motion of our eyes, we know
not all the principles of their operations, or how that dull matter whereof our bodies are composed, is
subject to the order of our minds. We are not of counsel with our stomachs about the concoction of our
meat, or the distribution of the nourishing juice to the several parts of the body.95 Neither the mother nor
the foetus sit in council how the formation should be made in the womb. We know no more than a plant
knows what stature it is of, and what medicinal virtue its fruit hath for the good of man; yet all those
natural operations are perfectly directed to their proper end, by an higher wisdom than any human
understanding is able to conceive, since they exceed the ability of an inanimate or fleshly nature, yea, and
the wisdom of a man. Do we not often see reasonable creatures acting for one end, and perfecting a higher
than what they aimed at or could suspect? When Joseph’s brethren sold him for a slave, their end was to
be rid of an informer;96 but the action issued in preparing him to be the preserver of them and their
families. Cyrus’s end was to be a conqueror, but the action ended in being the Jews’ deliverer (Prov.
16:9). “A man’s heart deviseth his way, but the Lord directs his steps.”
</p>
<p>
     3. Therefore there is some superior understanding and nature which so acts them. That which acts for
an end unknown to itself, depends upon some overruling wisdom that knows that end. Who should direct
them in all those ends, but He that bestowed a being upon them for those ends; who knows what is
convenient for their life, security and propagation of their natures?97 An exact knowledge is necessary
both of what is agreeable to them, and the means whereby they must attain it, which, since it is not
inherent in them, is in that wise God, who puts those instincts into them, and governs them in the exercise
of them to such ends. Any man that sees a dart flung, knows it cannot hit the mark without the skill and
strength of an archer; or he that sees the hand of a dial pointing to the hours successively, knows that the
dial is ignorant of its own end, and is disposed and directed in that motion by another. All creatures
ignorant of their own natures, could not universally in the whole kind, and in every climate and country,
without any difference in the whole world, tend to a certain end, if some overruling wisdom did not
preside over the world and guide them: and if the creatures have a Conductor, they have a Creator; all
things are “turned round about by his counsel, that they may do whatsoever he commands them, upon the
face of the world in the earth.”98 So that in this respect the folly of atheism appears. Without the owning a
God, no account can given of those actions of creatures, that are an imitation of reason. To say the bees,
&amp;c. are rational, is to equal them to man: nay, make them his superiors, since they do more by nature than
the wisest man can do by art: it is their own counsel whereby they act, or another’s; if it be their own, they
are reasonable creatures; if by another’s, it is not mere nature that is necessary; then other creatures would
not be without the same skill, there would be no difference among them. If nature be restrained by
another, it hath a superior; if not, it is a free agent; it is an understanding Being that directs them; and then
it is something superior to all creatures in the world; and by this, therefore, we may ascend to the
acknowledgment of the necessity of a God.
</p>
<p>
     Fourthly. Add to the production and order of the world and the creatures acting for their end, the
preservation of them. Nothing can depend upon itself in its preservation, no more than it could in its
being. If the order of the world was not fixed by itself, the preservation of that order cannot be continued
by itself. Though the matter of the world after creation cannot return to that nothing whence it was
fetched, without the power of God that made it, (because the same power is as requisite to reduce a thing
to nothing as to raise a thing from nothing,) yet without the actual exerting of a power that made the
creatures, they would fall into confusion. Those contesting qualities which are in every part of it, could
not have preserved, but would have consumed, and extinguished one another, and reduced the world to
that confused chaos, wherein it was before the Spirit moved upon the waters: as contrary parts could not
have met together in one form, unless there had been one that had conjoined them; so they could not have
kept together after their conjunction unless the same hand had preserved them. Natural contrarieties
cannot be reconciled. It is as great power to keep discords knit, as at first to link them. Who would doubt
but that an army made up of several nations and humors, would fall into a civil war and sheathe their
swords in one another’s bowels, if they were not under the management of some wise general; or a ship
dash against the rocks without the skill of a pilot? As the body hath neither life nor motion without the
active presence of the soul, which distributes to every part the virtue of acting, sets every one in the
exercise of its proper function, and resides in every part; so there is some powerful cause which doth the
like in the world, that rules and tempers it.99 There is need of the same power and action to preserve a
thing, as there was at first to make it. When we consider that we are preserved, and know that we could
not preserve ourselves, we must necessarily run to some first cause which doth preserve us. All works of
art depend upon nature, and are preserved while they are kept by the force of nature, as a statue depends
upon the matter whereof it is made, whether stone or brass; this nature, therefore, must have some
superior by whose influx it is preserved. Since, therefore, we see a stable order in the things of the world,
that they conspire together for the good and beauty of the universe; that they depend upon one another;
there must be some principle upon which they do depend; something to which the first link of the chain is
fastened, which himself depends upon no superior, but wholly rests in his own essence and being. It is the
title of God to be the “Preserver of man and beast.”100 The Psalmist elegantly describeth it, (Psalm
104:24, &amp;c.) “The earth is full of his riches: all wait upon him, that he may give them their meat in due
season. When he opens his hand, he fills them with good; when he hides his face they are troubled; if he
take away their breath, they die, and return to dust. He sends forth his Spirit, and they are created, and
renews the face of the earth. The glory of the Lord shall endure forever; and the Lord shall rejoice in his
works.” Upon the consideration of all which, the Psalmist (ver. 34) takes a pleasure in the meditation of
God as the cause and manager of all those things; which issues into a joy in God, and a praising of him.
And why should not the consideration of the power and wisdom of God in the creatures produce the same
effect in the hearts of us, if he be our God? Or, as some render it, “My meditation shall be sweet,” or
acceptable to him, whereby I find matter of praise in the things of the world, and offer it to the Creator of
it.
</p>
<p>
     Reason III. It is a folly to deny that which a man’s own nature witnesseth to him. The whole frame of
bodies and souls bears the impress of the infinite power and wisdom of the Creator: a body framed with
an admirable architecture, a soul endowed with understanding, will, judgment, memory, imagination.
Man is the epitome of the world, contains in himself the substance of all natures, and the fulness of the
whole universe; not only in regard of the universalness of his knowledge, whereby he comprehends the
reasons of many things; but as all the perfections of the several natures of the world are gathered and
united in man, for the perfection of his own, in a smaller volume. In his soul he partakes of heaven; in his
body of the earth. There is the life of plants, the sense of beasts, and the intellectual nature of angels. “The
Lord breathed into his nostril the breath of life, and man,”101 &amp;c.: ‫חזום‬, of lives. Not one sort of lives, but
several; not only an animal, but a rational life; a soul of a nobler extract and nature, than what was given
to other creatures. So that we need not step out of doors, or cast our eyes any further than ourselves, to
behold a God. He shines in the capacity of our souls, and the vigor of our members. We must fly from
ourselves, and be stripped of our own humanity, before we can put off the notion of a Deity. He that is
ignorant of the existence of God, must be possessed of so much folly, as to be ignorant of his own make
and frame.
</p>
<p>
    1. In the parts whereof he doth consist, body and soul.
</p>
<p>
    First, Take a prospect of the body. The Psalmist counts it a matter of praise and admiration (Psalm
139:15, 16): “I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. When I was made in secret, and
curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, in thy book all my members were written.” The scheme
of man and every member was drawn in his book. All the sinews, veins, arteries, bones, like a piece of
embroidery or tapestry, were wrought by God, as it were, with deliberation; like an artificer, that draws
out the model of what he is to do in writing, and sets it before him when he begins his work. And, indeed,
the fabric of man’s body, as well as his soul, is an argument for a Divinity. The artificial structure of it,
the elegancy of every part, the proper situation of them, their proportion one to another, the fitness for
their several functions, drew from Galen102 (a heathen, and one that had no raised sentiments of a Deity) a
confession of the admirable wisdom and power of the Creator, and that none but God could frame it.
</p>
<p>
    1. In the order, fitness, and usefulness of every part. The whole model of the body is grounded upon
reason. Every member hath its exact proportion, distinct office, regular motion. Every part hath a
particular comeliness, and convenient temperament bestowed upon it, according to its place in the body.
The heart is hot, to enliven the whole; the eye clear, to take in objects to present them to the soul. Every
member is presented for its peculiar service and action. Some are for sense, some for motion, some for
preparing, and others for dispensing nourishment to the several parts: they mutually depend upon and
serve one another. What small strings fasten the particular members together, “as the earth, that hangs
upon nothing!”103 Take but one part away, and you either destroy the whole, or stamp upon it some mark
of deformity. All are knit together by an admirable symmetry; all orderly perform their functions, as
acting by a settled law; none swerving from their rule, but in case of some predominant humor. And none
of them, in so great a multitude of parts, stifled in so little a room, or jostling against one another, to
hinder their mutual actions; none can be better disposed. And the greatest wisdom of man could not
imagine it, till his eyes present them with the sight and connection of one part and member with another.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) The heart.104 How strongly it is guarded with ribs like a wall, that it might not be easily hurt! It
draws blood from the liver, through a channel made for that purpose; rarefies it, and makes it fit to pass
through the arteries and veins, and to carry heat and life to every part of the body: and by a perpetual
motion, it sucks in the blood, and spouts it out again; which motion depends not upon the command of the
soul, but is pure natural.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) The mouth takes in the meat, the teeth grind it for the stomach, the stomach prepares it, nature
strains it through the milky veins, the liver refines it, and mints it into blood, separates the purer from the
drossy parts, which go to the heart, circuits through the whole body, running through the veins, like rivers
through so many channels of the world, for the watering of the several parts; which are framed of a thin
skin for the straining the blood through, for the supply of the members of the body, and framed with
several valves or doors, for the thrusting the blood forwards to perform its circular motion.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) The brain, fortified by a strong skull, to hinder outward accidents, a tough membrane or skin, to
hinder any oppression by the skull; the seat of sense, that which coins the animal spirits, by purifying and
refining those which are sent to it, and seems like a curious piece of needlework.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) The ear, framed with windings and turnings, to keep any thing from entering to offend the brain;
so disposed as to admit sounds with the greatest safety and delight; filled with an air within, by the motion
whereof the sound is transmitted to the brain:105 as sounds are made in the air by diffusing themselves, as
you see circles made in the water by the flinging in a stone. This is the gate of knowledge, whereby we
hear the oracles of God, and the instruction of men for arts. It is by this they are exposed to the mind, and
the mind of another man framed in our understandings.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) What a curious workmanship is that of the eye, which is in the body, as the sun in the world; set in
the head as in a watchtower, having the softest nerves for the receiving the greater multitude of spirits
necessary for the act of vision! How is it provided with defence, by the variety of coats to secure and
accommodate the little humor and part whereby the vision is made! Made of a round figure, and convex,
as most commodious to receive the species of objects shaded by the eyebrows and eyelids; secured by the
eyelids, which are its ornament and safety, which refresh it when it is too much dried by heat, hinder too
much light from insinuating itself into it to offend it, cleanse it from impurities, by their quick motion
preserve it from any invasion, and by contraction confer to the more evident discerning of things. Both the
eyes seated in the hollow of the bone for security, yet standing out, that things may be perceived more
easily on both sides. And this little member can behold the earth, and in a moment view things as high as
heaven.
</p>
<p>
    (6.) The tongue for speech framed like a musical instrument; the teeth serving for variety of sounds;
the lungs serving for bellows to blow the organs as it were, to cool the heart, by a continual motion
transmitting a pure air to the heart, expelling that which was smoky and superfluous.106 It is by the tongue
that communication of truth hath a passage among men; it opens the sense of the mind; there would be no
converse and commerce without it. Speech among all nations hath an elegancy and attractive force,
mastering the affections of men. Not to speak of other parts, or of the multitude of spirits that act every
part; the quick flight of them where there is a necessity of their presence. Solomon (Eccles. 12.) makes an
elegant description of them, in his speech of old age; and Job speaks of this formation of the body (Job
10:9–11), &amp;c. Not the least part of the body is made in vain. The hairs of the head have their use, as well
as are an ornament. The whole symmetry of the body is a ravishing object. Every member hath a signature
and mark of God and his wisdom. He is visible in the formation of the members, the beauty of the parts,
and the vigor of the body. This structure could not be from the body; that only hath a passive power, and
cannot act in the absence of the soul. Nor can it be from the soul. How comes it then to be so ignorant of
the manner of its formation? The soul knows not the internal parts of its own body, but by information
from others, or inspection into other bodies. It knows less of the inward frame of the body than it doth of
itself; but he that makes the clock can tell the number and motions of the wheels within, as well as what
figures are without.
</p>
<p>
    This short discourse is useful to raise our admirations of the wisdom of God, as well as to demonstrate
that there is an infinite wise Creator; and the consideration of ourselves every day, and the wisdom of God
in our frame, would maintain religion much in the world; since all are so framed that no man can tell any
error in the constitution of him. If thus the body of man is fitted for the service of his soul by an infinite
God, the body ought to be ordered for the service of this God, and in obedience to him.
</p>
<p>
    2. In the admirable difference of the features of men; which is a great argument that the world was
made by a wise Being. This could not be wrought by chance, or be the work of mere nature, since we find
never, or very rarely, two persons exactly alike. This distinction is a part of infinite wisdom; otherwise
what confusion would be introduced into the world? Without this, parents could not know their children,
nor children their parents, nor a brother his sister, nor a subject his magistrate. Without it there had been
no comfort of relations, no government, no commerce. Debtors would not have been known from
strangers, nor good men from bad. Propriety could not have been preserved, nor justice executed; the
innocent might have been apprehended for the nocent; wickedness could not have been stopped by any
law. The faces of men are the same for parts, not for features, a dissimitude in a likeness. Man, like to all
the rest in the world, yet unlike to any, and differenced by some mark from all, which is not to be
observed in any other species of creatures. This speaks some wise agent which framed man; since, for the
preservation of human society and order in the world, this distinction was necessary.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, As man’s own nature witnesseth a God to him in the structure of his body, so also “in the
nature of his soul.”107 We know that we have an understanding in us; a substance we cannot see, but we
know it by its operations; as thinking, reasoning, willing, remembering, and as operating about things that
are invisible and remote from sense. This must needs be distinct from the body; for that being but dust
and earth in its original, hath not the power of reasoning and thinking; for then it would have that power,
when the soul were absent, as well as when it is present. Besides, if it had that power of thinking, it could
think only of those things which are sensible, and made up of matter, as itself is. This soul hath a greater
excellency; it can know itself, rejoice in itself, which other creatures in this world are not capable of. The
soul is the greatest glory of this lower world; and, as one saith, “There seems to be no more difference
between the soul and an angel, than between a sword in the scabbard and when it is out of the
scabbard.”108
</p>
<p>
     1. Consider the vastness of its capacity. The understanding can conceive the whole world, and paint in
itself the invisible pictures of all things. It is capable of apprehending and discoursing of things superior
to its own nature. “It is suited to all objects, as the eye to all colors, or the ear to all sounds.”109 How great
is the memory, to retain such varieties, such diversities! The will also can accommodate other things to
itself. It invents arts for the use of man: prescribes rules for the government of states; ransacks the bowels
of nature; makes endless conclusions, and steps in reasoning from one thing to another, for the knowledge
of truth. It can contemplate and form notions of things higher than the world.
</p>
<p>
     2. The quickness of its motion. “Nothing is more quick in the whole course of nature. The sun runs
through the world in a day; this can do it in a moment. It can, with one flight of fancy, ascend to the
battlements of heaven.”110 The mists of the air, that hinder the sight of the eye, cannot hinder the flights of
the soul; it can pass in a moment from one end of the world to the other, and think of things a thousand
miles distant. It can think of some mean thing in the world; and presently, by one cast, in the twinkling of
an aye, mount up as high as heaven. As its desires are not bounded by sensual objects, so neither are the
motions of it restrained by them. It will break forth with the greatest vigor, and conceive things infinitely
above it; though it be in the body, it acts as if it were ashamed to be cloistered in it. This could not be the
result of any material cause. Whoever knew mere matter understand, think, will? and what it hath not, it
cannot give. That which is destitute of reason and will, could never confer reason and will. It is not the
effect of the body; for the body is fitted with members to be subject to it. It is in part ruled by the activity
of the soul, and in part by the counsel of the soul; it is used by the soul, and knows not how it is used.111
Nor could it be from the parents, since the souls of the children often transcend those of the parents in
vivacity, acuteness and comprehensiveness. One man is stupid, and begets a son with a capacious
understanding; one is debauched and beastly in morals, and begets a son who, from his infancy, testifies
some virtuous inclinations, which sprout forth in delightful fruit with the ripeness of his age. Whence
should this difference arise,—a fool begat the wise man, and a debauched the virtuous man? The wisdom
of the one could not descend from the foolish soul of the other; nor the virtues of the son, from the
deformed and polluted soul of the parent.112 It lies not in the organs of the body: for if the folly of the
parent proceeded not from their souls, but the ill disposition of the organs of their bodies, how comes it to
pass that the bodies of the children are better organized beyond the goodness of their immediate cause?
We must recur to some invisible hand, that makes the difference, who bestows upon one at his pleasure
richer qualities than upon another. You can see nothing in the world endowed with some excellent quality,
but you must imagine some bountiful hand did enrich it with that dowry. None can be so foolish as to
think that a vessel ever enriched itself with that sprightly liquor wherewith it is filled; or that anything
worse than the soul should endow it with that knowledge and activity which sparkles in it. Nature could
not produce it. That nature is intelligent, or not; if it be not, then it produceth an effect more excellent than
itself, inasmuch as an understanding being surmounts a being that hath no understanding. If the supreme
cause of the soul be intelligent, why do we not call it God as well as nature? We must arise from hence to
the notion of a God; a spiritual nature cannot proceed but from a spirit higher than itself, and of a
transcendent perfection above itself. If we believe we have souls, and understand the state of our own
faculties, we must be assured that there was some invisible hand which bestowed those faculties, and the
riches of them upon us. A man must be ignorant of himself before he can be ignorant of the existence of
God. By considering the nature of our souls, we may as well be assured that there is a God, as that there is
a sun, by the shining of the beams in at our windows; and, indeed, the soul is a statue and representation
of God, as the landscape of a country or a map represents all the parts of it, but in a far less proportion
than the country itself is. The soul fills the body, and God the world; the soul sustains the body, and God
the world; the soul sees, but is not seen; God sees all things, but is himself invisible. How base are they
then that prostitute their souls, an image of God, to base things unexpressibly below their own nature!
</p>
<p>
    3. I might add, the union of soul and body. Man is a kind of compound of angel and beast, of soul and
body; if he were only a soul, he were a kind of angel; if only a body, he were another kind of brute. Now
that a body as vile and dull as earth, and a soul that can mount up to heaven, and rove about the world,
with so quick a motion, should be linked in so strait an acquaintance; that so noble a being as the soul
should be inhabitant in such a tabernacle of clay; must be owned to some infinite power that hath so
chained it.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, Man witnesseth to a God in the operations and reflections of conscience. (Rom. 2:15), “Their
thoughts are accusing or excusing.” An inward comfort attends good actions, and an inward torment
follows bad ones; for there is in every man’s conscience fear of punishment and hope of reward; there is,
therefore, a sense of some superior judge, which hath the power both of rewarding and punishing. If man
were his supreme rule, what need he fear punishment, since no man would inflict any evil or torment on
himself; nor can any man be said to reward himself, for all rewards refer to another, to whom the action is
pleasing, and is a conferring some good a man had not before; if an action be done by a subject or servant,
with hopes of reward, it cannot be imagined that he expects a reward from himself, but from the prince or
person whom he eyes in that action, and for whose sake he doth it.
</p>
<p>
    1. There is a law in the minds of men which is a rule of good and evil. There is a notion of good and
evil in the consciences of men, which is evident by those laws which are common in all countries, for the
preserving human societies, the encouragement of human virtue, and discouragement of vice, what
standard should they have for those laws but a common reason? the design of those laws was to keep man
within the bounds of goodness for mutual commerce, whence the apostle calls the heathen magistrate a
“minister of God for good” (Rom. 13:4): and “the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law”
(Rom. 2:14).
</p>
<p>
    Man in the first instant of the use of reason, finds natural principles within himself; directing and
choosing them, he finds a distinction between good and evil; how could this be if there were not some
rule in him to try and distinguish good and evil? If there was not such a law and rule in man, he could not
sin; for where there is no law there is no transgression. If man were a law to himself, and his own will his
law, there could be no such thing as evil; whatsoever he willed, would be good and agreeable to the law,
and no action could be accounted sinful; the worst act would be as commendable as the best. Everything
at man’s appointment would be good or evil. If there were no such law, how should men that are naturally
inclined to evil disapprove of that which is unlovely, and approve of that good which they practise not?
No man but inwardly thinks well of that which is good, while he neglects it; and thinks ill of that which is
evil, while he commits it. Those that are vicious, do praise those that practise the contrary virtues. Those
that are evil would seem to be good, and those that are blameworthy yet will rebuke evil in others. This is
really to distinguish between good and evil; whence doth this arise, by what rule do we measure this, but
by some innate principle? And this is universal, the same in one man as in another, the same in one nation
as in another; they are born with every man, and inseparable from his nature (Prov. 27:19): as in water,
face answers to face, so the heart of man to man. Common reason supposeth that there is some hand
which hath fixed this distinction in man; how could it else be universally impressed? No law can be
without a lawgiver: no sparks but must be kindled, by some other. Whence should this law then derive its
original? Not from man; he would fain blot it out, and cannot alter it when he pleases. Natural generation
never intended it; it is settled therefore by some higher hand, which, as it imprinted it, so it maintains it
against the violence of men, who, were it not for this law, would make the world more than it is, an
aceldama and field of blood; for had there not been some supreme good, the measure of all other
goodness in the world, we could not have had such a thing as good. The Scripture gives us an account that
this good was distinguished from evil before man fell, they were objecta scibilia; good was commanded
and evil prohibited, and did not depend upon man. From this a man may rationally be instructed that there
is a God; for he may thus argue: I find myself naturally obliged to do this thing, and avoid that; I have,
therefore, a superior that doth oblige me; I find something within me that directs me to such actions,
contrary to my sensitive appetite; there must be something above me, therefore, that puts this principle
into man’s nature; if there were no superior, I should be the supreme judge of good and evil; were I the
lord of that law which doth oblige me, I should find no contradiction within myself, between reason and
appetite.
</p>
<p>
     2. From the transgression of this law of nature, fears do arise in the consciences of men. Have we not
known or heard of men struck by so deep a dart, that could not be drawn out by the strength of men, or
appeased by the pleasure of the world; and men crying out with horror, upon a death-bed, of their past
life, when “their fear hath come as a desolation, and destruction as a whirlwind?” (Prov. 1:27): and often
in some sharp affliction, the dust hath been blown off from men’s consciences, which for a while hath
obscured the writing of the law. If men stand in awe of punishment, there is then some superior to whom
they are accountable; if there were no God, there were no punishment to fear. What reason of any fear,
upon the dissolution of the knot between the soul and body, if there were not a God to punish, and the
soul remained not in being to be punished? How suddenly will conscience work upon the appearance of
an affliction, rouse itself from sleep like an armed man, and fly, in a man’s face before he is aware of it! It
will “surprise the hypocrites” (Isa. 38:14): it will bring to mind actions committed long ago, and set them
in order before the face, as God’s deputy, acting by his authority and omniscience. As God hath not left
himself without a witness among the creatures (Acts 14:17), so he hath not left himself without a witness
in a man’s own breast.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) This operation of conscience hath been universal. No nation hath been any more exempt from it
than from reason; not a man but hath one time or other more or less smarted under the sting of it. All over
the world conscience hath shot its darts; it hath torn the hearts of princes in the midst of their pleasures; it
hath not flattered them whom most men flatter; nor feared to disturb their rest, whom no man dares to
provoke. Judges have trembled on a tribunal, when innocents have rejoiced in their condemnation. The
iron bars upon Pharaoh’s conscience, were at last broke up, and he acknowledged the justice of God in all
that he did, (Exod. 9:27): “I have sinned, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.” Had
they been like childish frights at the apprehension of bugbears, why hath not reason shaken them off? But,
on the contrary, the stronger reason grows, the smarter those lashes are; groundless fears had been short-
lived, age and judgment would have worn them off, but they grow sharper with the growth of persons.
The Scripture informs us they have been of as ancient a date as the revolt of the first man, (Gen. 3:10): “I
was afraid,” saith Adam, “because I was naked” which was an expectation of the judgment of God. All
his posterity inherit his fears, when God expresseth himself in any tokens of his majesty and providence
in the world. Every man’s conscience testifies that he is unlike what he ought to be, according to that law
engraven upon his heart. In some, indeed, conscience may be seared or dimmer; or suppose some men
may be devoid of conscience, shall it be denied to be a thing belonging to the nature of man? Some men
have not their eyes, yet the power of seeing the light is natural to man, and belongs to the integrity of the
body. Who would argue that, because some men are mad, and have lost their reason by a distemper of the
brain, that therefore reason hath no reality, but is an imaginary thing? But I think it is a standing truth that
every man hath been under the scourge of it, one time or other, in a less or a greater degree; for, since
every man is an offender, it cannot be imagined, conscience, which is natural to man, and an active
faculty, should always lie idle, without doing this part of its office. The apostle tells us of the thoughts
accusing or excusing one another, (or by turns,) according as the actions were. Nor is this truth weakened
by the corruption in the world, whereby many have thought themselves bound in conscience to adhere to a
false and superstitious worship and idolatry, as much as any have thought themselves bound to adhere to a
worship commanded by God. This very thing infers that all men have a reflecting principle in them; it is
no argument against the being of conscience, but only infers that it may err in the application of what it
naturally owns. We can no more say, that because some men walk by a false rule, there is no such thing as
conscience, than we can say that because men have errors in their minds, therefore they have no such
faculty as an understanding; or because men will that which is evil, they have no such faculty as a will in
them.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) These operations of conscience are when the wickedness is most secret. These tormenting fears of
vengeance have been frequent in men, who have had no reason to fear man, since their wickedness being
unknown to any but themselves, they could have no accuser but themselves. They have been in many acts
which their companions have justified them in; persons above the stroke of human laws, yea, such as the
people have honored as gods, have been haunted by them. Conscience hath not been frighted by the
power of princes, or bribed by the pleasures of courts. David was pursued by his horrors, when he was, by
reason of his dignity, above the punishment of the law, or, at least, was not reached by the law; since,
though the murder of Uriah was intended by him, it was not acted by him. Such examples are frequent in
human records; when the crime hath been above any punishment by man, they have had an accuser,
judge, and executioner in their own breasts. Can this be originally from a man’s self? He who loves and
cherishes himself, would fly from anything that disturbs him; it is a greater power and majesty from
whom man cannot hide himself, that holds him in those fetters. What should affect their minds for that
which can never bring them shame or punishment in this world, if there were not some supreme judge to
whom they were to give an account, whose instrument conscience is? Doth it do this of itself? hath it
received an authority from the man himself to sting him? It is some supreme power that doth direct and
commission it against our wills.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) These operations of conscience cannot be totally shaken off by man. If there be no God, why do
not men silence the clamors of their consciences, and scatter those fears that disturb their rest and
pleasures? How inquisitive are men after some remedy against those convulsions! Sometimes they would
render the charge insignificant, and sing a rest to themselves, though they “walk in the wickedness of their
own hearts.”113 How often do men attempt to drown it by sensual pleasures, and perhaps overpower it for
a time; but it revives, reinforceth itself, and acts a revenge for its former stop. It holds sin to a man’s view,
and fixes his ayes upon it, whether he will or no. “The wicked are like a troubled sea, and cannot rest,”
(Isa. 57:20): they would wallow in sin without control, but this inward principle will not suffer it; nothing
can shelter men from those blows. What is the reason it could never be cried down? Man is an enemy to
his own disquiet; what man would continue upon the rack, if it were in his power to deliver himself? Why
have all human remedies been without success, and not able to extinguish those operations, though all the
wickedness of the heart hath been ready to assist and second the attempt? It hath pursued men
notwithstanding all the violence used against it; and renewed its scourges with more severity, as men deal
with their resisting slaves. Man can as little silence those thunders in his soul, as he can the thunders in
the heavens; he must strip himself of his humanity, before he can be stripped of an accusing and
affrighting conscience; it sticks as close to him as his nature; since man cannot throw out the process it
makes against him, it is an evidence that some higher power secures its throne and standing. Who should
put this scourge into the hand of conscience, which no man in the world is able to wrest out?
</p>
<p>
    (4.) We may add, the comfortable reflections of conscience. There are excusing, as well as accusing
reflections of conscience, when things are done as works of the “law of nature,” (Rom. 2:15): as it doth
not forbear to accuse and torture, when a wickedness, though unknown to others, is committed; so when a
man hath done well, though he be attacked with all the calumnies the wit of man can forge, yet his
conscience justifies the action, and fills him with a singular contentment. As there is torture in sinning, so
there is peace and joy in well-doing. Neither of those it could do, if it did not understand a Sovereign
Judge, who punishes the rebels, and rewards the well-doer. Conscience is the foundation of all religion;
and the two pillars upon which it is built, are the being of God, and the bounty of God to those that
“diligently seek him.”114 This proves the existence of God. If there were no God, conscience were useless;
the operations of it would have no foundation, if there were not an eye to take notice, and a hand to punish
or reward the action. The accusations of conscience evidence the omniscience and the holiness of God;
the terrors of conscience, the justice of God; the approbations of conscience, the goodness of God. All the
order in the world owes itself, next to the providence of God, to conscience; without it the world would be
a Golgotha. As the creatures witness, there was a first cause that produced them, so this principle in man
evidenceth itself to be set by the same hand, for the good of that which it had so framed. There could be
no conscience if there were no God, and man could not be a rational creature, if there were no conscience.
As there is a rule in us, there must be a judge, whether our actions be according to the rule. And since
conscience in our corrupted state is in some particular misled, there must be a power superior to
conscience, to judge how it hath behaved itself in its deputed office; we must come to some supreme
judge, who can judge conscience itself. As a man can have no surer evidence that he is a being, than
because he thinks he is a thinking being; so there is no surer evidence in nature that there is a God, than
that every man hath a natural principle in him, which continually cites him before God, and puts him in
mind of him, and makes him one way or other fear him, and reflects upon him whether he will or no. A
man hath less power over his conscience, than over any other faculty; he may choose whether he will
exercise his understanding about, or move his will to such an object; but he hath no such authority over
his conscience: he cannot limit it, or cause it to cease from acting and reflecting; and therefore, both that,
and the law about which it acts, are settled by some Supreme Authority in the mind of man, and this is
God.
</p>
<p>
    Fourthly. The evidence of a God results from the vastness of desires in man, and the real
dissatisfaction he hath in everything below himself. Man hath a boundless appetite after some sovereign
good; as his understanding is more capacious than anything below, so is his appetite larger. This affection
of desire exceeds all other affections. Love is determined to something known; fear, to something
apprehended: but desires approach nearer to infiniteness, and pursue, not only what we know, or what we
have a glimpse of, but what we find wanting in what we already enjoy. That which the desire of man is
most naturally carried after is bonum; some fully satisfying good. We desire knowledge by the sole
impulse of reason, but we desire good before the excitement of reason; and the desire is always after
good, but not always after knowledge. Now the soul of man finds an imperfection in everything here, and
cannot scrape up a perfect satisfaction and felicity. In the highest fruitions of worldly things it is still
pursuing something else, which speaks a defect in what it already hath. The world may afford a felicity
for our dust, the body, but not for the inhabitant in it; it is too mean for that. Is there any one soul among
the sons of men, that can upon a due inquiry say it was at rest and wanted no more, that hath not
sometimes had desires after an immaterial good? The soul “follows hard after” such a thing, and hath
frequent looks after it (Ps. 63:8). Man desires a stable good, but no sublunary thing is so; and he that doth
not desire such a good, wants the rational nature of a man. This is as natural as understanding, will, and
conscience. Whence should the soul of man have those desires? how came it to understand that something
is still wanting to make its nature more perfect, if there were not in it some notion of a more perfect being
which can give it rest? Can such a capacity be supposed to be in it without something in being able to
satisfy it? if so, the noblest creature in the world is miserablest, and in a worse condition than any other.
Other creatures obtain their ultimate desires, “they are filled with good,” (Ps. 104:28): and shall man only
have a vast desire without any possibility of enjoyment? Nothing in man is in vain; he hath objects for his
affections, as well as affections for objects; every member of his body hath its end, and doth attain it;
every affection of his soul hath an object, and that in this world; and shall there be none for his desire,
which comes nearest to infinite of any affection planted in him? This boundless desire had not its original
from man himself; nothing would render itself restless; something above the bounds of this world
implanted those desires after a higher good, and made him restless in everything else. And since the soul
can only rest in that which is infinite, there is something infinite for it to rest in; since nothing in the
world, though a man had the whole, can give it a satisfaction, there is something above the world only
capable to do it, otherwise the soul would be always without it, and be more in vain than any other
creature. There is, therefore, some infinite being that can only give a contentment to the soul, and this is
God. And that goodness which implanted such desires in the soul, would not do it to no purpose, and
mock it in giving it an infinite desire of satisfaction, without intending it the pleasure of enjoyment, if it
doth not by its own folly deprive itself of it. The felicity of human nature must needs exceed that which is
allotted to other creatures.
</p>
<p>
     Reason IV. As it is a folly to deny that which all nations in the world have consented to, which the
frame of the world evidenceth, which man in his body, soul, operations of conscience, witnesseth to; so it
is a folly to deny the being of God, which is witnessed unto by extraordinary occurrences in the world.
</p>
<p>
     1. In extraordinary judgments. When a just revenge follows abominable crimes, especially when the
judgment is suited to the sin by a strange concatenation and succession of providences, methodized to
bring such a particular punishment; when the sin of a nation or person is made legible in the inflicted
judgment, which testifies that it cannot be a casual thing. The Scripture gives us an account of the
necessity of such judgments, to keep up the reverential thoughts of God in the world (Ps. 9:16): “The
Lord is known by the judgment which he executes; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hand: and
jealousy is the name of God,” (Exod. 34:14), “Whose name is jealous.” He is distinguished from false
gods by the judgments which he sends, as men are by their names. Extraordinary prodigies in many
nations have been the heralds of extraordinary judgments, and presages of the particular judgments which
afterwards they have felt, of which the Roman histories, and others, are full. That there are such things is
undeniable, and that the events have been answerable to the threatening, unless we will throw away all
human testimonies, and count all the histories of the world forgeries. Such things are evidences of some
invisible power which orders those affairs. And if there be invisible powers, there is also an efficacious
cause which moves them; a government certainly there is among them, as well as in the world, and then
we must come to some supreme governor which presides over them. Judgments upon notorious offenders
have been evident in all ages; the Scripture gives many instances. I shall only mention that of Herod
Agrippa, which Josephus mentions.115 He receives the flattering applause of the people, and thought
himself a God; but by the sudden stroke upon him, was forced by his torture to confess another. “I am
God,” saith he, “in your account, but a higher calls me away; the will of the heavenly Deity is to be
endured.” The angel of the Lord smote him. The judgment here was suited to the sin; he that would be a
god, is eaten up of worms, the vilest creatures. Tully Hostilius, a Roman king, who counted it the most
unroyal thing to be religious, or own any other God but his sword, was consumed himself, and his whole
house, by lightning from heaven. Many things are unaccountable unless we have recourse to God. The
strange revelations of murderers, that have most secretly committed their crimes; the making good some
dreadful imprecations, which some wretches have used to confirm a lie, and immediately have been
struck with that judgment they wished; the raising often unexpected persons to be instruments of
vengeance on a sinful and perfidious nation; the overturning the deepest and surest counsels of men, when
they have had a successful progress, and come to the very point of execution; the whole design of men’s
preservation hath been eaten in pieces by some unforeseen circumstance, so that judgments have broken
in upon them without control, and all their subtleties been outwitted; the strange crossing of some in their
estates, though the most wise, industrious, and frugal persons, and that by strange and unexpected ways;
and it is observable how often everything contributes to carry on a judgment intended, as if they rationally
designed it: all those loudly proclaim a God in the world; if there were no God, there would be no sin; if
no sin, there would be no punishment.
</p>
<p>
     2. In miracles. The course of nature is uniform; and when it is put out of its course, it must be by some
superior power invisible to the world; and by whatsoever invisible instruments they are wrought, the
efficacy of them must depend upon some first cause above nature. (Psalm 72:18): “Blessed be the Lord
God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things,” by himself and his sole power. That which cannot be the
result of a natural cause, must be the result of something supernatural: what is beyond the reach of nature,
is the effect of a power superior to nature; for it is quite against the order of nature, and is the elevation of
something to such a pitch, which all nature could not advance it to. Nature cannot go beyond its own
limits; if it be determined by another, as hath been formerly proved, it cannot lift itself above itself,
without that power that so determined it. Natural agents act necessarily; the sun doth necessarily shine,
fire doth necessarily burn: that cannot be the result of nature, which is above the ability of nature; that
cannot be the work of nature which is against the order of nature; nature cannot do anything against itself,
or invert its own course. We must own that such things have been, or we must accuse all the records of
former ages to be a pack of lies; which whosoever doth, destroys the greatest and best part of human
knowledge. The miracles mentioned in the Scripture, wrought by our Saviour, are acknowledged by the
heathen, by the Jews at this day, though his greatest enemies. There is no dispute whether such things
were wrought, “the dead raised,” the “blind restored to sight.” The heathens have acknowledged the
miraculous eclipse of the sun at the passion of Christ, quite against the rule of nature, the moon being then
in opposition to the sun; the propagation of Christianity contrary to the methods whereby other religions
have been propagated, that in a few years the nations of the world should be sprinkled with this doctrine,
and give in a greater catalogue of martyrs courting the devouring flames, than all the religions of the
word. To this might be added, the strange hand that was over the Jews, the only people in the world
professing the true God, that should so often be befriended by their conquerors, so as to rebuild their
temple, though they were looked upon as a people apt to rebel. Dion and Seneca observe, that wherever
they were transplanted, they prospered, and gave laws to the victors; so that this proves also the authority
of the Scripture, the truth of christian religion, as well as the being of a God, and a superior power over
the world. To this might be added, the bridling the tumultuous passions of men for the preservation of
human societies, which else would run the world into unconceivable confusions, (Psalm 65:7) “Which
stilleth the noise of the sea, and the tumults of the people” as also the miraculous deliverance of a person
or nation, when upon the very brink of ruin; the sudden answer of prayer when God hath been sought to,
and the turning away a judgment, which in reason could not be expected to be averted, and the raising a
sunk people from a ruin which seemed inevitable, by unexpected ways.
</p>
<p>
     3. Accomplishments of prophecies. Those things which are purely contingent, and cannot be known
by natural signs and in their causes, as eclipses and changes in nations, which may be discerned by an
observation of the signs of the times; such things that fall not within this compass, if they be foretold and
come to pass, are solely from some higher hand, and above the cause of nature. This in Scripture is
asserted to be a notice of the true God (Isa. 41:23): “Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we
may know that you are God,” and (Isa. 46:10), “I am God declaring the end from the beginning, and from
ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my
pleasure.” And prophecy was consented to by all the philosophers to be from divine illumination: that
power which discovers things future, which all the foresight of men cannot ken and conjecture, is above
nature. And to foretell them so certainly as if they did already exist, or had existed long ago, must be the
result of a mind infinitely intelligent; because it is the highest way of knowing, and a higher cannot be
imagined: and he that knows things future in such a manner, must needs know things present and past.
Cyrus was prophesied of by Isaiah (44:28, and 45:1) long before he was born; his victories, spoils, all that
should happen in Babylon, his bounty to the Jews came to pass, according to that prophecy; and the sight
of that prophecy which the Jews shewed him, as other historians report, was that which moved him to be
favorable to the Jews.
</p>
<p>
     Alexander’s sight of Daniel’s prophecy concerning his victories moved him to spare Jerusalem. And
are not the four monarchies plainly deciphered in that book, before the fourth rose up in the world? That
power which foretells things beyond the reach of the wit of man, and orders all causes to bring about
those predictions, must be an infinite power, the same that made the world, sustains it and governs all
things in it according to his pleasure, and to bring about his own ends; and this being is God.
</p>
<p>
     Use I. If atheism be a folly, it is then pernicious to the world and to the atheist himself. Wisdom is the
band of human societies, the glory of man. Folly is the disturber of families, cities, nations; the disgrace
of human nature.
</p>
<p>
     First, It is pernicious to the world.
</p>
<p>
     1. It would root out the foundations of government. It demolisheth all order in nations. The being of a
God is the guard of the world: the sense of a God is the foundation of civil order: without this there is no
tie upon the consciences of men. What force would there be in oaths for the decisions of controversies,
what right could there be in appeals made to one that had no being? A city of atheists would be a heap of
confusion; there could be no ground of any commerce, when all the sacred bands of it in the consciences
of men were snapt asunder, which are torn to pieces and utterly destroyed by denying the existence of
God. What magistrate could be secure in his standing? what private person could be secure in his right?
Can that then be a truth that is destructive of all public good? If the atheist’s sentiment, that there were no
God, were a truth, and the contrary that there were a God, were a falsity, it would then follow, that falsity
made men good and serviceable to one another; that error were the foundation of all the beauty, and order,
and outward felicity of the world, the fountain of all good to man.116 If there were no God, to believe there
is one, would be an error; and to believe there is none, would be the greatest wisdom, because it would be
the greatest truth. And then as it is the greatest wisdom to fear God, upon the apprehension of his
existence, so it would be the greatest error to fear him if there were none.117 It would unquestionably
follow, that error is the support of the world, the spring of all human advantages; and that every part of the
world were obliged to a falsity for being a quiet habitation, which is the most absurd thing to imagine. It
is a thing impossible to be tolerated by any prince, without laying an aye to the root of the government.
</p>
<p>
     2. It would introduce all evil into the world. “If you take away God, you take away conscience, and
thereby all measures and rules of good and evil. And how could any laws be made when the measure and
standard of them were removed? All good laws are founded upon the dictates of conscience and reason,
upon common sentiments in human nature, which spring from a sense of God; so that if the foundation be
demolished, the whole superstructure must tumble down: a man might be a thief, a murderer, an adulterer,
and could not in a strict sense be an offender. The worst of actions could not be evil, if a man were a god
to himself, a law to himself. Nothing but evil deserves a censure, and nothing would be evil if there were
no God, the Rector of the world against whom evil is properly committed. No man can make that morally
evil that is not so in itself: as where there is a faint sense of God, the heart is more strongly inclined to
wickedness; so where there is no sense of God, the bars are removed, the flood-gates set open for all
wickedness to rush in upon mankind. Religion pinions men from abominable practices, and restrains them
from being slaves to their own passions: an atheist’s arms would be loose to do anything.”118 Nothing so
villanous and unjust but would be acted if the natural fear of a Deity were extinguished. The first
consequence issuing from the apprehension of the existence of God, is his government of the world. If
there be no God, then the natural consequence is that there is no supreme government of the world: such a
notion would cashier all sentiments of good, and be like a Trojan horse, whence all impurity, tyranny, and
all sorts of mischiefs would break out upon mankind: corruption and abominable works in the text are the
fruit of the fool’s persuasion that there is no God. The perverting the ways of men, oppression and
extortion, owe their rise to a forgetfulness of God (Jer. 3:21): “They have perverted their way, and they
have forgotten the Lord their God.” (Ezek. 22:12): “Thou hast greedily gained by extortion, and hast
forgotten me, saith the Lord.” The whole earth would be filled with violence, all flesh would corrupt their
way, as it was before the deluge, when probably atheism did abound more than idolatry; and if not a
disowning the being, yet denying the providence of God by the posterity of Cain: those of the family of
Seth only “calling upon the name of the Lord” (Gen. 6:11, 12, compared with Gen. 4:26).
</p>
<p>
     The greatest sense of a Deity in any, hath been attended with the greatest innocence of life and
usefulness to others; and a weaker sense hath been attended with a baser impurity. If there were no God,
blasphemy would be praiseworthy; as the reproach of idols is praiseworthy, because we testify that there
is no divinity in them.119 What can be more contemptible than that which hath no being? Sin would be
only a false opinion of a violated law, and an offended deity. If such apprehensions prevail, what a wide
door is opened to the worst of villanies! If there be no God, no respect is due to him; all the religion in the
world is a trifle, and error; and thus the pillars of all human society, and that which hath made
commonwealths to flourish, are blown away.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, It is pernicious to the atheist himself. If he fear no future punishment, he can never expect
any future reward: all his hopes must be confined to a swinish and despicable manner of life, without any
imaginations of so much as a drachm of reserved happiness. He is in a worse condition than the silliest
animal, which hath something to please it in its life: whereas an atheist can have nothing here to give him
a full content, no more than any other man in the world, and can have less satisfaction hereafter. He
deposeth the noble end of his own being, which was to serve a God and have a satisfaction in him, to seek
a God and be rewarded by him; and he that departs from his end, recedes from his own nature. All the
content any creature finds, is in performing its end, moving according to its natural instinct; as it is a joy
to the sun to run its race.120 In the same manner it is a satisfaction to every other creature, and its delight
to observe the law of its creation. What content can any man have that runs from his end, opposeth his
own nature, denies a God by whom and for whom he was created, whose image he bears, which is the
glory of his nature, and sinks into the very dregs of brutishness? How elegantly it is described by
Bildad,121 “His own counsel shall cast him down, terrors shall make him afraid on every side, destruction
shall be ready at his side, the first-born of death shall devour his strength, his confidence shall be rooted
out, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation; he shall
be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. They that come after him shall be
astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. And this is the place of him that knows not
God.”122 If there be a future reckoning (as his own conscience cannot but sometimes inform him of), his
condition is desperate, and his misery dreadful and unavoidable. It is not righteous a hell should entertain
any else, if it refuse him.
</p>
<p>
     Use II. How lamentable is it, that in our times this folly of atheism should be so rife! That there should
be found such monsters in human nature, in the midst of the improvements of reason, and shinings of the
gospel, who not only make the Scripture the matter of their jeers, but scoff at the judgments and
providences of God in the world, and envy their Creator a being, without whose goodness they had none
themselves; who contradict in their carriage what they assert to be their sentiment, when they dreadfully
imprecate damnation to themselves! Whence should that damnation they so rashly wish be poured forth
upon them, if there were not a revenging God? Formerly atheism was as rare as prodigious, scarce two or
three known in an age; and those that are reported to be so in former ages, are rather thought to be counted
so for mocking at the senseless deities the common people adored, and laying open their impurities. A
mere natural strength would easily, discover that those they adored for gods, could not deserve that title,
since their original was known, their uncleanness manifest and acknowledged by their worshippers. And
probably it was so; since the Christians were termed ἄθεοι, because they acknowledged not their vain
idols.123
</p>
<p>
    I question whether there ever was, or can be in the world, an uninterrupted and internal denial of the
being of God, or that men (unless we can suppose conscience utterly dead) can arrive to such a degree of
impiety; for before they can stifle such sentiments in them (whatsoever they may assert), they must be
utter strangers to the common conceptions of reason, and despoil themselves of their own humanity. He
that dares to deny a God with his lips, yet sets up something or other as a God in his heart. Is it not
lamentable that this sacred truth, consented to by all nations, which is the band of civil societies, the
source of all order in the world, should be denied with a bare face, and disputed against in companies, and
the glory of a wise Creator ascribed to an unintellient nature, to blind chance? Are not such worse than
heathens? They worshipped many gods, these none; they preserved a notion of God in the world under a
disguise of images, these would banish him both from earth and heaven, and demolish the statutes of him
in their own consciences; they degraded him, these would destroy him; they coupled creatures with him—
(Rom. 1:25), “Who worshipped the creature with the Creator,” as it may most properly be rendered—and
these would make him worse than the creature, a mere nothing. Earth is hereby become worse than hell.
Atheism is a persuasion which finds no footing anywhere else. Hell, that receives such persons, in this
point reforms them: they can never deny or doubt of his being, while they feel his strokes. The devil, that
rejoices at their wickedness, knows them to be in an error; for he “believes, and trembles at the belief.”124
This is a forerunner of judgment. Boldness in sin is a presage of vengeance, especially when the honor of
God is more particularly concerned therein; it tends to the overturning human society, taking off the bridle
from the wicked inclinations of men and God appears not in such visible judgments against sin
immediately committed against himself, as in the case of those sins that are destructive to human society.
Besides, God, as Governor of the world, will uphold that, without which all his ordinances in the world
would be useless. Atheism is point blank against all the glory of God in creation, and against all the glory
of God in redemption, and pronounceth at one breath, both the Creator, and all acts of religion and divine
institutions, useless and insignificant. Since most have had, one time or other, some risings of doubt,
whether there be a God, though few do in expressions deny his being, it may not be unnecessary to
propose some things for the further impressing this truth, and guarding themselves against such
temptations.
</p>
<p>
    1. It is utterly impossible to demonstrate there is no God. He can choose no medium, but will fall in as
a proof for his existence, and a manifestation of his excellency, rather than against it. The pretences of the
atheist are so ridiculous, that they are not worth the mentioning. They never saw God, and therefore know
not how to believe such a being; they cannot comprehend him. He would not be a God, if he could fall
within the narrow model of a human understanding; he would not be infinite, if he were comprehensible,
or to be terminated by our sight. How small a thing must that be which is seen by a bodily eye, or grasped
by a weak mind! If God were visible or comprehensible, he would be limited. Shall it be a sufficient
demonstration from a blind man, that there is no fire in the room, because he sees it not, though he feel the
warmth of it? The knowledge of the effect is sufficient to conclude the existence of the cause. Who ever
saw his own life? Is it sufficient to deny a man lives, because he beholds not his life, and only knows it by
his motion? He never saw his own soul, but knows he hath one by his thinking power. The air renders
itself sensible to men in its operations, yet was never seen by the eye. If God should render himself
visible, they might question as well as now, whether that which was so visible were God, or some
delusion. If he should appear glorious, we can as little behold him in his majestic glory, as an owl can
behold the sun in its brightness: we should still but see him in his effects, as we do the sun by his beams.
If he should show a new miracle, we should still see him but by his works; so we see him in his creatures,
every one of which would be as great a miracle as any can be wrought, to one that had the first prospect of
them. To require to see God, is to require that which is impossible (1 Tim. 6:16): “He dwells in the light
which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.” It is visible that he is, “for he
covers himself with light as with a garment” (Psalm 104:2); it is visible what he is, “for he makes
darkness his secret place” (Psalm 18:11). Nothing more clear to the eye than light, and nothing more
difficult to the understanding than the nature of it: as light is the first object obvious to the eye, so is God
the first object obvious to the understanding. The arguments from nature do, with greater strength; evince
his existence, than any pretences can manifest there is no God. No man can assure himself by any good
reason there is none; for as for the likeness of events to him that is righteous, and him that is wicked; to
him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not (Eccles. 9:2): it is an argument for a reserve of
judgment in another state, which every man’s conscience dictates to him, when the justice of God shall be
glorified in another world, as much as his patience is in this.
</p>
<p>
    2. Whosoever doubts of it, makes himself a mark, against which all the creatures fight. All the stars
fought against Sisera for Israel: all the stars in heaven, and the dust on earth, fight for God against the
atheist. He hath as many arguments against him as there are creatures in the whole compass of heaven and
earth. He is most unreasonable, that denies or doubts of that whose image and shadow he sees round
about him; he may sooner deny the sun that warms him, the moon that in night walks in her brightness,
deny the fruits he enjoys from the earth, yea, and deny that he doth exist. He must tear his own
conscience, fly from his own thoughts, be changed into the nature of a stone, which hath neither reason
nor sense, before he can disengage himself from those arguments which evince the being of a God. He
that would make the natural religion professed in the world a mere romance, must give the lie to the
common sense of mankind; he must be at an irreconcilable enmity with his own reason, resolve to hear
nothing that it speaks, if he will not hear what it speaks in this case, with a greater evidence than it can
ascertain anything else. God hath so settled himself in the reason of man, that he must vilify the noblest
faculty God hath given him, and put off nature itself, before he can blot out the notion of a God.
</p>
<p>
    3. No question but those that have been so bold as to deny that there was a God, have sometimes been
much afraid they have been in an error, and have at least suspected there was a God, when some sudden
prodigy hath presented itself to them, and roused their fears; and whatsoever sentiments they might have
in their blinding prosperity, they have had other kind of motions in them in their stormy afflictions, and,
like Jonah’s mariners, have been ready to cry to him for help, whom they disdained to own so much as in
being, while they swam in their pleasures. The thoughts of a Deity cannot be so extinguished, but they
will revive and rush upon a man, at least under some sharp affliction. Amazing judgments will make them
question their own apprehensions. God sends some messengers to keep alive the apprehension of him as a
Judge, while men resolve not to own or reverence him as a Governor. A man cannot but keep a scent of
what was born with him; as a vessel that hath been seasoned first with a strong juice will preserve the
scent of it, whatsoever liquors are afterwards put into it.
</p>
<p>
    4. What is it for which such men rack their wits, to form notions that there is no God? Is it not that
they would indulge some vicious habit, which hath gained the possession of their soul, which they know
“cannot be favored by that holy God,” whose notion they would raze out?125 Is it not for some brutish
affection, as degenerative of human nature, as derogatory to the glory of God; a lust as unmanly as sinful?
The terrors of God are the effects of guilt; and therefore men would wear out the apprehensions of a
Deity, that they might be brutish without control. They would fain believe there were no God, that they
might not be men, but beasts. How great a folly is it to take so much pains in vain, for a slavery and
torment; to cast off that which they call a yoke, for that which really is one! There is more pains and
toughness of soul requisite to shake off the apprehensions of God, than to believe that he is, and cleave
constantly to him. What a madness is it in any to take so much pains to be less than a man, by razing out
the apprehensions of God, when, with less pains, he may be more than an earthly man, by cherishing the
notions of God, and walking answerably thereunto?
</p>
<p>
    5. How unreasonable is it for any man to hazard himself at this rate in the denial of a God! The atheist
saith he knows not that there is a God; but may he not reasonably think there may be one for aught he
knows? and if there be, what a desperate confusion will he be in, when all his bravadoes shall prove false!
What can they gain by such an opinion? A freedom, say they, from the burdensome yoke of conscience, a
liberty to do what they list, that doth not subject them to divine laws. It is a hard matter to persuade any
that they can gain this. They can gain but a sordid pleasure, unworthy the nature of man. But it were well
that such would argue thus with themselves: If there be a God, and I fear and obey him, I gain a happy
eternity; but if there be no God, I lose nothing but my sordid lusts, by firmly believing there is one. If I be
deceived at last, and find a God, can I think to be rewarded by him, for disowning him? Do not I run a
desperate hazard to lose his favor, his kingdom, and endless felicity for an endless torment? By confessing
a God I venture no loss; but by denying him, I run the most desperate hazard, if there be one. He is not a
reasonable creature, that will not put himself upon such a reasonable arguing. What a doleful meeting will
there be between the God who is denied, and the atheist that denies him, who shall meet with reproaches
on God’s part, and terrors on his own! All that he gains is a liberty to defile himself here, and a certainty
to be despised hereafter, if he be in an error, as undoubtedly he is.
</p>
<p>
    6. Can any such person say he hath done all that he can to inform himself of the being of God, or of
other things which he denies? Or rather they would fain imagine there is none, that they may sleep
securely in their lusts, and be free (if they could from the thunder-claps of conscience. Can such say they
have used their utmost endeavors to instruct themselves in this, and can meet with no satisfaction? Were it
an abstruse truth it might not be wondered at; but not to meet with satisfaction in this which everything
minds us of, and helpeth, is the fruit of an extreme negligence, stupidity, and a willingness to be
unsatisfied, and a judicial process of God against them. It is strange any man should be so dark in that
upon which depends the conduct of his life, and the expectation of happiness hereafter. I do not know
what some of you may think, but believe these things are not useless to be proposed for ourselves to
answer temptations; we know not what wicked temptation in a debauched and skeptic age, meeting with a
corrupt heart, may prompt men to; and though there may not be any atheist here present, yet I know there
is more than one, who have accidentally met with such, who openly denied a Deity; and if the like
occasion happen, these considerations may not be unuseful to apply to their consciences. But I must
confess, that since those that live in this sentiment, do not judge themselves worthy of their own care, they
are not worthy of the care of others; and a man must have all the charity of the christian religion, which
they despise, not to condemn them, and leave them to their own folly. As we are to pity madmen, who
sink under an unavoidable distemper, we are as much to abominate them, who wilfully hug this
prodigious frenzy.
</p>
<p>
    Use III. If it be the atheist’s folly to deny or doubt of the being of God, it is our wisdom to be firmly
settled in this truth, that God is. We should never be without our arms in an age wherein atheism appears
barefaced without a disguise. You may meet with suggestions to it, though the devil formerly never
attempted to demolish this notion in the world, but was willing to keep it up, so the worship due to God
might run in his own channel, and was necessitated to preserve it, without which he could not have
erected that idolatry, which was his great design in opposition to God; yet since the foundations of that are
torn up, and never like to be rebuilt, he may endeavor, as his last refuge, to banish the notion of God out
of the world, that he may reign as absolutely without it, as he did before by the mistakes about the divine
nature. But we must not lay all upon Satan; the corruption of our own hearts ministers matter to such
sparks. It is not said Satan hath suggested to the fool, but “the fool hath said in his heart,” there is no God.
But let them come from what principle soever, silence them quickly, give them their dismiss; oppose the
whole scheme of nature to fight against them, as the stars did against Sisera. Stir up sentiments of
conscience to oppose sentiments of corruption. Resolve sooner to believe that yourselves are not, than that
God is not; and if you suppose they at any time come from Satan, object to him that you know he believes
the contrary to what he suggests. Settle this principle firmly in you, “let us behold Him that is invisible,”
as Moses did;126 let us have the sentiments following upon the notion of a God, to be restrained by a fear
of him, excited by a love to him, not to violate his laws and offend his goodness. He is not a God careless
of our actions, negligent to inflict punishment, and bestow rewards, “he forgets not the labor of our
love,”127 nor the integrity of our ways; he were not a God, if he were not a governor; and punishments and
rewards are as essential to government, as a foundation to a building. His being and his government in
rewarding, which implies punishment, (for the neglects of him are linked together)128 are not to be
separated in our thoughts of him.
</p>
<p>
    1. Without this truth fixed in us, we can never give him the worship due to his name. When the
knowledge of anything is fluctuating and uncertain, our actions about it are careless. We regard not that
which we think doth not much concern us. If we do not firmly believe there is a God, we shall pay him no
steady worship; and if we believe not the excellency of his nature, we shall offer him but a slight
service.129 The Jews call the knowledge of the being of God the foundation and pillar of wisdom.130 The
whole frame of religion is dissolved without this apprehension, and totters if this apprehension be
wavering. Religion in the heart is as water in a weatherglass, which riseth or falls according to the
strength or weakness of this belief. How can any man worship that which he believes not to be, or doubts
of? Could any man omit the paying a homage to one, whom he did believe to be an omnipotent, wise
being, possessing (infinitely above our conceptions) the perfections of all creatures? He must either think
there is no such being, or that he is an easy, drowsy, inobservant God, and not such an one as our natural
notions of him, if listened to, as well as the Scripture, represents him to be.
</p>
<p>
    2. Without being rooted in this, we cannot order our lives. All our baseness, stupidity, dulness,
wanderings, vanity, spring from a wavering and unsettledness in this principle. This gives ground to
brutish pleasures, not only to solicit, but conquer us. Abraham expected violence in any place where God
was not owned (Gen. 20:11), “Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my
wife’s sake.” The natural knowledge of God firmly impressed, would choke that which would stifle our
reason and deface our souls. The belief that God is, and what he is, would have a mighty influence to
persuade us to a real religion, and serious consideration, and casting about how to be like to him and
united with him.
</p>
<p>
    3. Without it we cannot have any comfort of our lives. Who would willingly live in a stormy world,
void of a God? If we waver in this principle, to whom should we make our complaints in our afflictions?
Where should we meet with supports? How could we satisfy ourselves with the hopes of a future
happiness? There is a sweetness in the meditation of his existence, and that he is a Creator.131 Thoughts of
other things have a bitterness mixed with them: houses, lands, children, now are, shortly they will not be;
but God is, that made the world: his faithfulness as he is a Creator, is a ground to deposit our souls and
concerns in our innocent sufferings.132 So far as we are weak in the acknowledgment of God, we deprive
ourselves of our content in the view of his infinite perfections.
</p>
<p>
    4. Without the rooting of this principle, we cannot have a firm belief of Scripture. The Scripture will
be a slight thing to one that hath weak sentiments of God. The belief of a God must necessarily precede
the belief of any revelation; the latter cannot take place without the former as a foundation. We must
firmly believe the being of a God, wherein our happiness doth consist, before we can believe any means
which conduct us to him. Moses begins with the Author of creation, before he treats of the promise of
redemption. Paul preached God as a Creator to a university, before he preached Christ as Mediator.133
What influence can the testimony of God have in his revelation upon one that doth not firmly assent to the
truth of his being? All would be in vain that is so often repeated, “Thus saith the Lord,” if we do not
believe there is a Lord that speaks it. There could be no awe from his sovereignty in his commands, nor
any comfortable taste of his goodness in his promises. The more we are strengthened in this principle, the
more credit we shall be able to give to divine revelation, to rest in his promise, and to reverence his
precept; the authority of all depends upon the being of the Revealer.
</p>
<p>
    To this purpose, since we have handled this discourse by natural arguments,
</p>
<p>
    1. Study God in the creatures as well as in the Scriptures. The primary use of the creatures, is to
acknowledge God in them; they were made to be witnesses of himself in his goodness, and heralds of his
glory, which glory of God as Creator “shall endure forever” (Psalm 104:31): that whole psalm is a lecture
of creation and providence. The world is a sacred temple; man is introduced to contemplate it, and behold
with praise the glory of God in the pieces of his art. As grace doth not destroy nature, so the book of
redemption blots not out that of creation. Had he not shown himself in his creatures, he could never have
shown himself in his Christ; the order of things required it. God must be read wherever he is legible; the
creatures are one book, wherein he hath writ a part of the excellencey of his name,134 as many artists do in
their works and watches. God’s glory, like the filings of gold, is too precious to be lost wherever it drops:
nothing so vile and base in the world, but carries in it an instruction for man, and drives in further the
notion of a God. As he said of his cottage, Enter here, Sunt hic etiam Dii, God disdains not this place: so
the least creature speaks to man, every shrub in the field, every fly in the air, every limb in a body;
Consider me, God disdains not to appear in me; he hath discovered in me his being and a part of his skill,
as well as in the highest. The creatures manifest the being of God and part of his perfections. We have
indeed a more excellent way, a revelation setting him forth in a more excellent manner, a firmer object of
dependence, a brighter object of love, raising our hearts from self-confidence to a confidence in him.
Though the appearance of God in the one be clearer than in the other, yet neither is to be neglected. The
Scripture directs us to nature to view God; it had been in vain else for the apostle to make use of natural
arguments. Nature is not contrary to Scripture, nor Scripture to nature; unless we should think God
contrary to himself who is the Author of both.
</p>
<p>
    2. View God in your own experiences of him. There is a taste and sight of his goodness, though no
sight of his essence.135 By the taste of his goodness you may know the reality of the fountain, whence it
springs and from whence it flows; this surpasseth the greatest capacity of a mere natural understanding.
Experience of the sweetness of the ways of Christianity is a mighty preservative against atheism. Many a
man knows not how to prove honey to be sweet by his reason, but by his sense; and if all the reason in the
world be brought against it, he will not be reasoned out of what he tastes. Have not many found the
delightful illapses of God into their souls, often sprinkled with his inward blessings upon their seeking of
him; had secret warnings in their approaches to him; and gentle rebukes in their consciences upon their
swervings from him? Have not many found sometimes an invisible hand raising them up when they were
dejected; some unexpected providence stepping in for their relief; and easily perceived that it could not be
a work of chance, nor many times the intention of the instruments he hath used in it? You have often
found that he is, by finding that he is a rewarder, and can set to your seals that he is what he hath declared
himself to be in his word (Isa. 34:12) “I have declared, and have saved; therefore you are my witnesses,
with the Lord, that I am God.” The secret touches of God upon the heart, and inward converses with him,
are a greater evidence of the existence of a supreme and infinitely good Being, than all nature.
</p>
<p>
    Use IV. Is it a folly to deny or doubt of the being of God? It is a folly also not to worship God, when
we acknowledge his existence; it is our wisdom then to worship him. As it is not indifferent whether we
believe there is a God or no; so it is not indifferent whether we will give honor to that God or no. A
worship is his right as he is the Author of our being, and fountain of our happiness. By this only we
acknowledge his Deity; though we may profess his being, yet we deny that profession in neglects of
worship. To deny him a worship is as great a folly, as to deny his being. He that renounceth all homage to
his Creator, envices him the being which he cannot deprive him of. The natural inclination to worship is
as universal as the notion of a God; idolatry else had never gained footing in the world. The existence of
God was never owned in any nation, but a worship of him was appointed. And many people who have
turned their backs upon some other parts of the law of nature, have paid a continual homage to some
superior and invisible being. The Jews give a reason why man was created in the evening of the Sabbath,
because he should begin his being with the worship of his Maker. As soon as ever he found himself to be
a creature, his first solemn act should be a particular respect to his Creator. “To fear God and keep his
commandment,” is the whole of man,136 or is whole man137 he is not a man but a beast, without
observance of God. Religion is as requisite as reason to complete a man: he were not reasonable if he
were not religious; because by neglecting religion, he neglects the chiefest dictate of reason. Either God
framed the world with so much order, elegancy, and variety to no purpose, or this was his end at least, that
reasonable creatures should admire him in it, and honor him for it. The notion of God was not stamped
upon men, the shadows of God did not appear in the creatures, to be the subject of an idle contemplation,
but the motive of a due homage to God. He created the world for his glory, a people for himself, that he
might have the honor of his works; that since we live and move in him, and by him, we should live and
move to him and for him. It was the condemnation of the heathen world, that when they knew there was a
God, they did not give him the glory due to him.138 He that denies his being, is an atheist to his essence:
he that denies his worship, is an atheist to his honor.
</p>
<p>
     If it be a folly to deny the being of God, it will be our wisdom, then, since we acknowledge his being,
often to think of him. Thoughts are the first issue of a creature as reasonable:139 He that hath given us the
faculty whereby we are able to think, should be the principal object about which the power of it should be
exercised. It is a justice to God, the author of our understandings, a justice to the nature of our
understandings, that the noblest faculty should be employed about the most excellent object. Our minds
are a beam from God; and, therefore, as the beams of the sun, when they touch the earth, should reflect
back upon God. As we seem to deny the being of God not to think of him; we seem also to unsoul our
souls in misemploying the activity of them any other way, like flies, to be oftener on dunghills than
flowers. It is made the black mark of an ungodly man, or an atheist, that “God is not in all his thoughts”
(Psalm 10:4). What comfort can be had in the being of God without thinking of him with reverence and
delight? A God forgotten is as good as no God to us.

<h1 class="caption">DISCOURSE II - ON PRACTICAL ATHEISM</h1>
                               
<blockquote>
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
<div class="sig">PSALM 14:1</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
     PRACTICAL atheism is natural to man in his depraved state, and very frequent in the hearts and lives
of men.
</p>
<p>
     The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. He regards him as little as if he had no being. He said
in his heart, not with his tongue, nor in his head: he never firmly thought it, nor openly asserted it. Shame
put a bar to the first, and natural reason to the second; yet, perhaps, he had sometimes some doubts
whether there were a God or no. He wished there were not any, and sometimes hoped there were none at
all. He could not raze out the notion of a Deity in his mind, but he neglected the fixing the sense of God in
his heart, and made it too much his business to deface and blot out those characters of God in his soul,
which had been left under the ruins of original nature. Men may have atheistical hearts without atheistical
heads. Their reasons may defend the notion of a Deity, while their hearts are empty of affection to the
Deity. Job’s children may curse God in their hearts, though not with their lips.140
</p>
<p>
     There is no God. Most understand it of a denial of the providence of God, as I have said in opening
the former doctrine. He denies some essential attribute of God, or the exercise of that attribute in the
world.141 He that denies any essential attribute, may be said to deny the being of God. Whosoever denies
angels or men to have reason and will, denies the human and angelical nature, because understanding and
will are essential to both those natures; there could neither be angel nor man without them. No nature can
subsist without the perfections essential to that nature, nor God be conceived of without his. The apostle
tells us (Eph. 2:12), that the Gentiles were “without God in the world.” So, in some sense, all unbelievers
may be termed atheists; for rejecting the Mediator appointed by God, they reject that God who appointed
him. But this is beyond the intended scope, natural atheism being the only subject; yet this is deducible
from it. That the title of ἄθεοι doth not only belong to those who deny the existence of God, or to those
who contemn all sense of a Deity, and would root the conscience and reverence of God out of their souls;
but it belongs also to those who give not that worship to God which is due to him, who worship many
gods, or who worship one God in a false and superstitious manner, when they have not right conceptions
of God, nor intend an adoration of him according to the excellency of his nature. All those that are
unconcerned for any particular religion fall under this character: though they own a God in general, yet
are willing to acknowledge any God that shall be coined by the powers under whom they live. The
Gentiles were without God in the world; without the true notion of God, not without a God of their own
framing. This general or practical atheism is natural to men.
</p>
<p>
     1. Not natural by created, but by corrupted nature. It is against nature, as nature came out of the hand
of God; but universally natural, as nature hath been sophisticated and infected by the serpent’s breath.
Inconsideration of God, or misrepresentation of his nature, are as agreeable to corrupt nature, as the
disowning the being of a God is contrary to common reason. God is not denied, naturâ, sed vitiis.142
</p>
<p>
     2. It is universally natural: “The wicked are estranged from the womb (Psalm 58:3). They go astray as
soon as they be born: their poison is like the poison of a serpent.” The wicked, (and who by his birth hath
a better title?) they go astray from the dictates of God and the rule of their creation as soon as ever they be
born. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, which is radically the same in all of the same species. It
is seminally and fundamentally in all men, though there may be a stronger restraint by a divine hand upon
some men than upon others. This principle runs through the whole stream of nature. The natural bent of
every man’s heart is distant from God. When we attempt anything pleasing to God, it is like the climbing
up a hill, against nature; when anything is displeasing to him, it is like a current running down the channel
in its natural course; when we attempt anything that is an acknowledgment of the holiness of God, we are
fain to rush, with arms in our hands, through a multitude of natural passions, and fight the way through
the oppositions of our own sensitive appetite. How softly do we naturally sink down into that which sets
us at a greater distance from God! There is no active, potent, efficacious sense of a God by nature. “The
heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil” (Eccl. 8:11). The heart, in the singular number, as
if there were but one common heart beat in all mankind, and bent, as with one pulse, with a joint consent
and force to wickedness, without a sense of the authority of God in the earth, as if one heart acted every
man in the world. The great apostle cites the text to verify the charge he brought against all mankind.143 In
his interpretation, the Jews, who owned one God, and were dignified with special privileges, as well as
the Gentiles that maintained many gods, are within the compass of this character. The apostle leaves out
the first part of the text, “The fool hath said in his heart,” but takes in the latter part, and the verses
following. He charges all, because all, every man of them, was under sin—“There is none that seeks
God;” and, ver. 19, he adds, “What the law saith, it speaks to those that are under the law,” that none
should imagine he included only the Gentiles, and exempted the Jews from this description. The leprosy
of atheism had infected the whole mass of human nature. No man, among Jews or Gentiles, did naturally
seek God; and, therefore, all were void of any spark of the practical sense of the Deity. The effects of this
atheism are not in all externally of an equal size; yet, in the fundamentals and radicals of it, there is not a
hair’s difference between the best and the worst men that ever traversed the world. The distinction is laid
either in common grace, bounding and suppressing it; or in special grace, killing and crucifying it. It is in
every one either triumphant or militant, reigning or deposed. No man is any more born with sensible
acknowledgments of God, than he is born with a clear knowledge of the nature of all the stars in the
heavens, or plants upon the earth. None seeks after God.144 None seek God as his rule, as his end, as his
happiness, which is a debt the creature naturally owes to God. He desires no communion with God; he
places his happiness in anything inferior to God; he prefers everything before him, glorifies everything
above him; be hath no delight to know him; he regards not those paths which lead to him; he loves his
own filth better than God’s holiness; his actions are tinctured and dyed with self, and are void of that
respect which is due from him to God.
</p>
<p>
     The noblest faculty of man, his understanding, wherein the remaining lineaments of the image of God
are visible; the highest operation of that faculty, which is wisdom, is, in the judgment of the Spirit of God,
devilish, whilst it is earthly and sensual;145 and the wisdom of the best man is no better by nature; a legion
of impure spirits possess it; devilish, as the devil, who, though he believe there is a God, yet acts as if
there were none, and wishes he had no superior to prescribe him a law, and inflict that punishment upon
him which his crimes have merited. Hence the poison of man by nature is said to be like the poison of a
serpent,146 alluding to that serpentine temptation which first infected mankind, and changed the nature of
man into the likeness of that of the devil; so that, notwithstanding the harmony of the world, that presents
men not only with the notice of the being of a God, but darts into their minds some remarks of his power
and eternity; yet the thoughts and reasonings of man are so corrupt, as may well be called diabolical, and
as contrary to the perfection of God, and the original law of their nature, as the actings of the devil are; for
since every natural man is a child of the devil, and is acted by the diabolical spirit, he must needs have
that nature which his father hath, and the infusion of that venom which the spirit that acts him is
possessed with, though the full discovery of it may be restrained by various circumstances (Eph. 2:2). To
conclude: though no man, or at least very few, arrive to a round and positive conclusion in their hearts
that there is no God, yet there is no man that naturally hath in his heart any reverence of God. In general,
before I come to a particular proof, take some propositions.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. I. Actions are a greater discovery of a principle than words. The testimony of works is louder
and clearer than that of words; and the frame of men’s hearts must be measured rather by what they do
than by what they say. There may be a mighty distance between the tongue and the heart, but a course of
actions is as little guilty of lying as interest is, according to our common saying. All outward impieties are
the branches of an atheism at the root of our nature, as all pestilential sores are expressions of the
contagion in the blood; sin is therefore frequently called ungodliness in our English dialect. Men’s
practices are the best indexes of their principles: the current of a man’s life is the counterpart of the frame
of his heart. Who can deny an error in the spring or wheels, when he perceives an error in the hand of the
dial? Who can deny an atheism in the heart, when so much is visible in the life? The taste of the water
discovers what mineral it is strained through. A practical denial of God is worse than a verbal, because
deeds have usually more of deliberation than words; words may be the fruit of a passion, but a set of evil
actions are the fruit and evidence of a predominant evil principle in the heart. All slighting words of a
prince do not argue an habitual treason; but a succession of overt treasonable attempts signify a settled
treasonable disposition in the mind. Those, therefore, are more deservedly termed atheists, who
acknowledge a God, and walk as if there were none, than those (if there can be any such) that deny a God,
and walk as if there were one. A sense of God in the heart would burst out in the life; where there is no
reverence of God in the life, it is easily concluded there is less in the heart. What doth not influence a man
when it hath the addition of the eyes, and censures of outward spectators, and the care of a reputation (so
much the god of the world) to strengthen it and restrain the action, must certainly have less power over the
heart when it is single, without any other concurrence. The flames breaking out of a house discover the
fire to be much stronger and fiercer within. The apostle judgeth those of the circumcision, who gave heed
to Jewish fables, to be deniers of God, though he doth not tax them with any notorious profaneness: (Tit.
1:16), “They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him.” He gives them epithets contrary to
what they arrogated to themselves.147 They boasted themselves to be holy; the apostle calls them
abominable: they bragged that they fulfilled the law, and observed the traditions of their fathers; the
apostle calls them disobedient, or unpersuadable: they boasted that they only had the rule of
righteousness, and a sound judgment concerning it; the apostle said they had a reprobate sense, and unfit
for any good work; and judges against all their vain-glorious brags, that they had not a reverence of God
in their hearts; there was more of the denial of God in their works than there was acknowledgment of God
in their words. Those that have neither God in their thoughts, nor in their tongues, nor in their works,
cannot properly be said to acknowledge him. Where the honor of God is not practically owned in the lives
of men, the being of God is not sensibly acknowledged in the hearts of men. The principle must be of the
same kind with the actions; if the actions be atheistical, the principle of them can be no better.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. II. All sin is founded in a secret atheism. Atheism is the spirit of every sin;—all the floods of
impieties in the world break in at the gate of a secret atheism, and though several sins may disagree with
one another, yet, like Herod and Pilate against Christ, they join hand in hand against the interest of God.
Though lusts and pleasures be diverse, yet they are all united in disobedience to him.148 All the wicked
inclinations in the heart, and struggling motions, secret repinings, self-applauding confidences in our own
wisdom, strength, &amp;c., envy, ambition, revenge, are sparks from this latent fire; the language of every one
of these is, I would be a Lord to myself, and would not have a God superior to me. The variety of sins
against the first and second table, the neglects of God, and violences against man, are derived from this in
the text; first, “The fool hath said in his heart,” and then follows a legion of devils. As all virtuous actions
spring from an acknowledgment of God, so all vicious actions rise from a lurking denial of him: all
licentiousness goes glib down where there is no sense of God. Abraham judged himself not secure from
murder, nor his wife from defilement in Gerar, if there were no fear of God there.149 He that makes no
conscience of sin has no regard to the honor, and, consequently, none to the being of God. “By the fear of
God men depart from evil” (Prov. 16:6); by the non-regarding of God men rush into evil. Pharaoh
oppressed Israel because he “knew not the Lord.” If he did not deny the being of a Deity, yet he had such
an unworthy notion of God as was inconsistent with the nature of a Deity; he, a poor creature, thought
himself a mate for the Creator. In sins of omission we own not God, in neglecting to perform what he
enjoins; in sins of commission we set up some lust in the place of God, and pay to that the homage which
is due to our Maker. In both we disown him; in the one by not doing what he commands, in the other by
doing what he forbids. We deny his sovereignty when we violate his laws; we disgrace his holiness when
we cast our filth before his face; we disparage his wisdom when we set up another rule as the guide of our
actions than that law he hath fixed; we slight his sufficiency when we prefer a satisfaction in sin before a
happiness in him alone; and his goodness, when we judge it not strong enough to attract us to him. Every
sin invades the rights of God, and strips him of one or other of his perfections. It is such a vilifying of
God as if he were not God; as if he were not the supreme Creator and Benefactor of the world; as if we
had not our being from him; as if the air we breathed in, the food we lived by, were our own by right of
supremacy, not of donation. For a subject to slight his sovereign, is to slight his royalty; or a servant his
master, is to deny his superiority.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. III. Sin implies that God is unworthy of a being. Every sin is a kind of cursing God in the
heart;150 an aim at the destruction of the being of God; not actually, but virtually; not in the intention of
every sinner, but in the nature of every sin. That affection which excites a man to break His law, would
excite him to annihilate his being if it were in his power. A man in every sin aims to set up his own will as
his rule, and his own glory as the end of his actions against the will and glory of God; and could a sinner
attain his end, God would be destroyed. God cannot outlive his will and his glory; God cannot have
another rule but his own will, nor another end but his own honor. Sin is called a turning the back upon
God,151 a kicking against him,152 as if he were a slighter person than the meanest beggar. What greater
contempt cane shown to the meanest, vilest person, than to turn the back, lift up the heel, and thrust away
with indignation? all which actions, though they signify that such a one hath a being, yet they testify also
that he is unworthy of a being, that he is an unuseful being in the world, and that it were well the world
were rid of him. All sin against knowledge is called a reproach of God.153 Reproach is a vilifying a man as
unworthy to be admitted into company. We naturally judge God unfit to be conversed with. God is the
term turned from by a sinner; sin is the term turned to, which implies a greater excellency in the nature of
sin than in the nature of God; and as we naturally judge it more worthy to have a being in our affections,
so consequently more worthy to have a being in the world, than that infinite nature from whom we derive
our beings and our all, and upon whom, with a kind of disdain, we turn our backs. Whosoever thinks the
notion of a Deity unfit to be cherished in his mind by warm meditation, implies that he cares not whether
he hath a being in the world or no. Now though the light of a Deity shines so clearly in man, and the
stings of conscience are so smart, that he cannot absolutely deny the being of a God, yet most men
endeavor to smother this knowledge, and make the notion of a God a sapless and useless thing (Rom.
1:28): “They like not to retain God in their knowledge.” It is said, “Cain went out from the presence of the
Lord” (Gen. 4:16); that is, from the worship of God. Our refusing or abhorring the presence of a man
implies a carelessness whether he continue in the world or no; it is a using him as if he had no being, or as
if we were not concerned in it. Hence all men in Adam, under the emblem of the prodigal, are said to go
into a far country; not in respect of place, because of God’s omnipresence, but in respect of
acknowledgment and affection: they mind and love anything but God. And the descriptions of the nations
of the world, lying in the ruins of Adam’s fall, and the dregs of that revolt, is that they know not God.
They forget God, as if there were no such being above them; and, indeed, he that doth the works of the
devil, owns the devil to be more worthy of observance, and, consequently, of a being, than God, whose
nature he forgets, and whose presence he abhors.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. IV. Every sin in its own nature would render God a foolish and impure being. Many
transgressors esteem their acts, which are contrary to the law of God, both wise and good: if so, the law
against which they are committed, must be both foolish and impure. What a reflection is there, then, upon
the Lawgiver! The moral law is not properly a mere act of God’s will considered in itself, or a tyrannical
edict, like those of whom it may well be said, stat pro ratione voluntas: but it commands those things
which are good in their own nature, and prohibits those things which are in their own nature evil; and
therefore is an act of his wisdom and righteousness; the result of his wise counsel, and an extract of his
pure nature; as all the laws of just lawgivers, are not only the acts of their will, but of a will governed by
reason and justice, and for the good of the public, whereof they are conservators. If the moral commands
of God were only acts of his will, and had not an intrinsic necessity, reason and goodness, God might
have commanded the quite contrary, and made a contrary law, whereby that which we now call vice,
might have been canonized for virtue: He might then have forbid any worship of him, love to him, fear of
his name: He might then have commanded murders, thefts, adulteries. In the first he would have untied
the link of duty from the creature, and dissolved the obligations of creatures to him, which is impossible
to be conceived; for from the relation of a creature to God, obligations to God, and duties upon those
obligations, do necessarily result. It had been against the rule of goodness and justice to have commanded
the creature not to, love him, and fear and obey him: this had been a command against righteousness,
goodness, and intrinsic obligations to gratitude. And should murder, adulteries, rapines have been
commanded instead of the contrary, God would have destroyed his own creation; he would have acted
against the rule of goodness and order; he had been an unjust tyrannical governor of the world: public
society would have been cracked in pieces, and the world become a shambles, a brothel-house, a place
below the common sentiments of a mere man. All sin, therefore, being against the law of God, the
wisdom and holy rectitude of God’s nature is denied in every act of disobedience. And what is the
consequence of this, but that God is both foolish and unrighteous in commanding that, which was neither
an act of wisdom, as a governor, nor an act of goodness, as a benefactor to his creature? As was said
before, presumptuous sins are called reproaches of God (Num. 15:30): “The soul that doth aught
presumptuously reproacheth the Lord.” Reproaches of men are either for natural, moral, or intellectual
defects. All reproaches of God must imply a charge, either of unrighteousness or ignorance: if of
unrighteousness, it is a denial of his holiness; if of ignorance, it is a blemishing his wisdom. If God’s laws
were not wise and holy, God would not enjoin them: and if they are so, we deny infinite wisdom and
holiness in God by not complying with them. As when a man believes not God when he promises, he
makes him a liar (1 John 5:10); so he that obeys not a wise and holy God commanding, makes him guilty
either of folly or unrighteousness. Now, suppose you knew an absolute atheist who denied the being of a
God, yet had a life free from any notorious spot or defilement; would you in reason count him so bad as
the other that owns a God in being, yet lays, by his course of action, such a black imputation of folly and
impurnty upon the God he professeth to own—an imputation which renders any man a most despicable
creature?
</p>
<p>
    Prop. V. Sin in its own nature endeavors to render God the most miserable being. It is nothing but an
opposition to the will of God the will of no creature is so much contradicted as the will of God is by
devils and men; and there is nothing under the heavens that the affections of human nature stand more
point blank against, than against God. There is a slight of him in all the faculties of man; our souls are as
unwilling to know him, as our wills are averse to follow him (Rom. 8:7): “The carnal mind is enmity
against God, it is not subject to the law of God, nor can be subject.” It is true, God’s will cannot be
hindered of its effect, for then God would not be supremely blessed, but unhappy and miserable: all
misery ariseth from a want of that which a nature would have, and ought to have besides, if anything
could frustrate God’s will, it would be superior to him: God would not be omnipotent, and so would lose
the perfection of the Deity, and consequently the Deity itself; for that which did wholly defeat God’s will,
would be more powerful than he. But sin is a contradiction to the will of God’s revelation, to the will of
his precept: and therein doth naturally tend to a superiority over God, and would usurp his omnipotence,
and deprive him of his blessedness. For if God had not an infinite power to turn the designs of it to his
own glory, but the will of sin could prevail, God would be totally deprived of his blessedness. Doth not
sin endeavor to subject God to the extravagant and contrary wills of men, and make him more a slave than
any creature can be? For the will of no creature, not the meanest and most despicable creature, is so much
crossed, as the will of God is by sin (Isa. 43:24): “Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins:” thou hast
endeavored to make a mere slave of me by sin. Sin endeavors to subject the blessed God to the humor and
lust of every person in the world.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. VI. Men sometimes in some circumstances do wish the not being of God. This some think to be
the meaning of the text, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,” that is, he wishes there were no
God. Many tamper with their own hearts to bring them to a persuasion that there is no God: and when
they cannot do that, they conjure up wishes that there were none. Men naturally have some conscience of
sin, and some notices of justice (Rom. 1:32): “They know the judgment of God,” and they know the
demerit of sin; “they know the judgment of God, and that they which do such things are worthy of death.”
What is the consequent of this but fear of punishment; and what is the issue of that fear, but a wishing the
Judge either unwilling or unable to vindicate the honor of his violated law? When God is the object of
such a wish, it is a virtual undeifying of him: not to be able to punish, is to be impotent; not to be willing
to punish, is to be unjust: imperfections inconsistent with the Deity. God cannot be supposed without an
infinite power to act, and an infinite righteousness as the rule of acting. Fear of God is natural to all men;
not a fear of offending him, but a fear of being punished by him: the wishing the extinction of God has its
degree in men, according to the degree of their fears of his just vengeance: and though such a wish be not
in its meridian but in the damned in hell, yet it hath its starts and motions in affrighted and awakened
consciences on the earth: under this rank of wishers, that there were no God, or that God were destroyed,
do fall.
</p>
<p>
     1. Terrified consciences, that are Magor-missabib, see nothing but matter of fear round about. As they
have lived without the bounds of the law, they are afraid to fall under the stroke of his justice: fear wishes
the destruction of that which it apprehends hurtful: it considers him as a God to whom vengeance belongs,
as the Judge of all the earth.154 The less hopes such an one hath of his pardon, the more joy he would have
to hear that his judge should be stripped of his life: he would entertain with delight any reasons that might
support him in the conceit that there were no God: in his present state such a doctrine would be his
security from an account: he would as much rejoice if there were no God to inflame an hell for him, as
any guilty malefactor would if there were no judge to order a gibbet for him. Shame may bridle men’s
words, but the heart will be casting about for some arguments this way, to secure itself: such as are at any
time in Spira’s case, would be willing to cease to be creatures, that God might cease to be Judge. “The
fool hath said in his heart, there is no Elohim, no Judge;” fancying God without any exercise of his
judicial authority. And there is not any wicked man under anguish of spirit, but, were it within the reach
of his power, would take away the life of God, and rid himself of his fears by destroying his Avenger.
</p>
<p>
     2. Debauched persons are not without such wishes sometimes: an obstinate servant wishes his
master’s death, from whom he expects correction for his debaucheries. As man stands in his corrupt
nature, it is impossible but one time or other most debauched persons at least have some kind of velleities,
or imperfect wishes. It is as natural to men to abhor those things which are unsuitable and troublesome, as
it is to please themselves in things agreeable to their minds and humors; and since man is so deeply in
love with sin, as to count it the most estimable good, he cannot but wish the abolition of that law which
checks it, and, consequently, the change of the Lawgiver which enacted it; and in wishing a change in the
holy nature of God, he wishes a destruction of God, who could not be God if he ceased to be immutably
holy. They do as certainly wish that God had not a holy will to command them, as despairing souls wish
that God had not a righteous will to punish them, and to wish conscience extinct for the molestations they
receive from it, is to wish the power conscience represents out of the world also. Since the state of sinners
is a state of distance from God, and the language of sinners to God is, “Depart from us;”155 they desire as
little the continuance of his being, as they desire the knowledge of his ways; the same reason which
moves them to desire God’s distance from them, would move them to desire God’s not being: since the
greatest distance would be most agreeable to them, the destruction of God must be so too; because there is
no greater distance from us, than in not being. Men would rather have God not to be, than themselves
under control, that sensuality might range at pleasure; he is like a “heifer sliding from the yoke” (Hosea
4:16). The cursing of God in the heart, feared by Job of his children, intimates a wishing God despoiled of
his authority, that their pleasure might not be damped by his law. Besides, is there any natural man that
sins against actuated knowledge, but either this or wishes that God might not see him, that God might not
know his actions? And is not this to wish the destruction of God, who could not be God unless he were
immense and omniscient?
</p>
<p>
    3. Under this rank fall those who perform external duties only out of a principle of slavish fear. Many
men perform those duties that the law enjoins, with the same sentiments that slaves perform their
drudgery; and are constrained in their duties by no other considerations but those of the whip and the
cudgel. Since, therefore, they do it with reluctancy, and secretly murmur while they seem to obey, they
would be willing that both the command were recalled, and the master that commands them were in
another world. The spirit of adoption makes men act towards God as a father, a spirit of bondage only
eyes him as a judge. Those that look upon their superiors as tyrannical, will not be much concerned in
their welfare; and would be more glad to have their nails pared, than be under perpetual fear of them.
Many men regard not the Infinite Goodness in the service of him, but consider him as cruel, tyrannical,
injurious to their liberty. Adam’s posterity are not free from the sentiments of their common father, till
they are regenerate. You know what conceit was the hammer whereby the hellish Jael struck the nail into
our first parents, which conveyed death, together with the same imagination to all their posterity (Gen.
3:5): “God knows that in the day you eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.” Alas, poor souls! God knew what he did when he forbade you that fruit; he was
jealous you should be too happy; it was cruelty in him to deprive you of a food so pleasant and delicious.
The apprehension of the severity of God’s commands riseth up no less in desires that there were no God
over us, than Adam’s apprehension of envy in God for the restraint of one tree, moved him to attempt to
be equal with God: fear is as powerful to produce the one in his posterity, as pride was to produce the
other in the common root. When we apprehend a thing hurtful to us, we desire so much evil to it, as may
render it incapable of doing us the hurt we fear. As we wish the preservation of what we love or hope for,
so we are naturally apt to wish the not being of that whence we fear some hurt or trouble. We must not
understand this as if any man did formally wish the destruction of God, as God. God in himself is an
infinite mirror of goodness and ravishing loveliness; he is infinitely good, and so universally good, and
nothing but good; and is therefore so agreeable to a creature, as a creature, that it is impossible that the
creature, while it bears itself to God as a creature, should be guilty of this, but thirst after him and cherish
every motion to him. As no man wishes the destruction of any creature, as a creature, but as it may
conduce to something which he counts may be beneficial to himself; so no man doth, nor perhaps can
wish the cessation of the being of God, as God; for then he must wish his own being to cease also; but as
he considers him clothed with some perfections, which he apprehends as injurious to him, as his holiness
in forbidding sin, his justice in punishing sin; and God being judged in those perfections, contrary to what
the revolted creature thinks convenient and good for himself, he may wish God stripped of those
perfections, that thereby he may be free from all fear of trouble and grief from him in his fallen state. In
wishing God deprived of those, he wishes God deprived of his being; because God cannot retain his deity
without a love of righteousness, and hatred of iniquity; and he could not testify his love to the one, or his
loathing of the other, without encouraging goodness, and witnessing his anger against iniquity. Let us
now appeal to ourselves, and examine our own consciences. Did we never please ourselves sometimes in
the thoughts, how happz we should be, how free in our vain pleasures, if there were no God? Have we not
desired to be our own lords, without control, subject to no law but our own, and be guided by no will but
that of the flesh? Did we never rage against God under his afflicting hand? Did we never wish God
stripped of his holy will to command, and his righteous will to punish? &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    Thus much for the general. For the proof of this, many considerations will bring in evidence; most
may be reduced to these two generals: Man would set himself up, first, as his own rule; secondly, as his
own end and happiness.
</p>
<p>
    I. Man would set himself up as his own rule instead of God. This will be evidenced in this method.
</p>
<p>
    1. Man naturally disowns the rule God sets him. 2. He owns any other rule rather than that of God’s
prescribing. 3. These he doth in order to the setting himself up as his own rule. 4. He makes himself not
only his own rule, but he would make himself the rule of God, and give laws to his Creator.
</p>
<p>
    First, Man naturally disowns the rule God sets him. It is all one to deny his royalty, and to deny his
being. When we disown his authority, we disown his Godhead. It is the right of God to be the sovereign
of his creatures, and it must be a very loose and trivial assent that such men have to God’s superiority
over them, (and consequently to the excellency of his being, upon which that authority is founded) who
are scarce at ease in themselves, but when they are invading his rights, breaking his bands, casting away
his cords, and contradicting his will: Every man naturally is a son of Belial, would be without a yoke, and
leap over God’s enclosures; and in breaking out against his sovereignty, we disown his being, as God, for
to be God and sovereign are inseparable; he could not be God, if he were not supreme; nor could he be a
Creator without being a Lawgiver. To be God and yet inferior to another, is a contradiction. To make
rational creatures without prescribing them a law, is to make them without holiness, wisdom and
goodness.
</p>
<p>
    1. There is in man naturally an unwillingness to have any acquaintance with the rule God sets him
(Psalm 14:2): “None that did understand and seek God.” The refusing instruction and casting his Word
behind the back is a part of atheism.156 We are heavy in hearing the instructions either of law or gospel,157
and slow in the apprehension of what we hear. The people that God had hedged in from the wilderness of
the world for his own garden, were foolish and did not know God; were sottish and had no understanding
of him.158 The law of God is accounted a strange thing;159 a thing of a different climate, and a far country
from the heart of man; wherewith the mind of man had no natural acquaintance, and had no desire to have
any; or they regarded it as a sordid thing: what God accounts great and valuable, they account mean and
despicable. Men may show a civility to a stranger, but scarce contract an intimacy: there can be no
amicable agreement between the holy will of God and the heart of a depraved creature: one is holy, the
other unholy; one is universally good, the other stark naught. The purity of the Divine rule renders it
nauseous to the impurity of a carnal heart. Water and fire may as well friendly kiss each other and live
together without quarrelling and hissing, as the holy will of God and the unregenerate heart of a fallen
creature.
</p>
<p>
    The nauseating a holy rule is an evidence of atheism in the heart, as the nauseating wholesome food is
of putrefied phlegm in the stomach. It is found more or less in every Christian, in the remainders, though
not in a full empire. As there is a law in his mind whereby he delights in the law of God, so there is a law
in his members whereby he wars against the law of God (Rom. 7:22, 23, 25). How predominant is this
loathing of the law of God, when corrupt nature is in its full strength, without any principle to control it!
There is in the mind of such a one a darkness, whereby it is ignorant of it, and in the will a depravedness,
whereby it is repugnant to it. If man were naturally willing and able to have an intimate acquaintance
with, and delight in the law of God, it had not been such a signal favor for God to promise to “write the
law in the heart.” A man may sooner engrave the chronicle of a whole nation, or all the records of God in
the Scripture upon the hardest marble with his bare finger, than write one syllable of the law of God in a
spiritual manner upon his heart. For,
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Men are negligent in using the means for the knowledge of God’s will. All natural men are fools,
who know not how to use the price God puts into their hands;160 they put not a due estimate upon
opportunities and means of grace, and account that law folly which is the birth of an infinite and holy
wisdom. The knowledge of God which they may glean from creatures, and is more pleasant to the natural
gust of men, is not improved to the glory of God, if we will believe the indictment the apostle brings
against the Gentiles.161 And most of those that have dived into the depths of nature, have been more
studious of the qualities of the creatures, than of the excellency of the nature, or the discovery of the mind
of God in them; who regard only the rising and motions of the star, but follow not with the wise men, its
conduct to the King of the Jews. How often do we see men filled with an eager thirst for all other kind of
knowledge, that cannot acquiesce in a twilight discovery, but are inquisitive into the causes and reasons of
effects, yet are contented with a weak and languishing knowledge of God and his law, and are easily tired
with the proposals of them! He now that nauseates the means whereby he may come to know and obey
God, has no intention to make the law of God his rule. There is no man that intends seriously an end, but
he intends means in order to that end: as when a man intends the preservation or recovery of his health, he
will intend means in order to those ends, otherwise he cannot be said to intend his health; so he that is not
diligent in using means to know the mind of God, has no sound intention to make the will and law of God
his rule. Is not the inquiry after the will of God made a work by the bye, and fain to lacquey after other
concerns of an inferior nature, if it hath any place at all in the soul? which is a despising the being of God.
The notion of the sovereignty of God bears the same date with the notion of his Godhead; and by the
same way that he reveals himself, he reveals his authority over us: whether it be by creatures without, or
conscience within. All authority over rational creatures consists in commanding and directing: the duty of
rational creatures in compliance with that authority consists in obeying. Where there is therefore a
careless neglect of those means which convey the knowledge of God’s will and our duty, there is an utter
disowning of God as our Sovereign and our rule.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) When any part of the mind and will of God breaks in upon men, they endeavor to shake it off: as a
man would a sergeant that comes to arrest him, “they like not to retain God in their knowledge” (Rom.
1:28). “A natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God;” that is, into his affection; he pusheth
them back as men do troublesome and importunate beggars: they have no kindness to bestow upon it: they
thrust with both shoulders against the truth of God, when it presseth in upon them; and dash as much
contempt upon it as the Pharisees did upon the doctrine our Saviour directed against their covetousness.
As men naturally delight to be without God in the world, so they delight to be without any offspring of
God in their thoughts. Since the spiritual palate of man is depraved, divine truth is unsavory and
ungrateful to us, till our taste and relish is restored by grace: hence men damp and quench the motions of
the Spirit to obedience and compliance with the dictates of God; strip them of their life and vigor, and kill
them in the womb. How unable are our memories to retain the substance of spiritual truth; but like sand in
a glass, put in at one part and runs out at the other! Have not many a secret wish, that the Scripture had
never mentioned some truths, or that they were blotted out of the Bible, because they face their
consciences, and discourage those boiling lusts they would with eagerness and delight pursue? Methinks
that interruption John gives our Saviour when he was upon the reproof of their pride, looks little better
than a design to divert him from a discourse so much against the grain, by telling him a story of their
prohibiting one to cast out devils, because he followed not them.162 How glad are men when they can raise
a battery against a command of God, and raise some smart objection whereby they may shelter
themselves from the strictness of it!
</p>
<p>
    (3.) When men cannot shake off the notices of the will and mind of God, they have no pleasure in the
consideration of them; which could not possibly be, if there were a real and fixed design to own the mind
and law of God as our rule. Subjects or servants that love to obey their prince and master, will delight to
read and execute their orders. The devils understand the law of God in their minds, but they loathe the
impressions of it upon their wills: those miserable spirits are bound in chains of darkness, evil habits in
their wills, that they have not a thought of obeying that law they know. It was an unclean beast under the
law that did not chew the cud: it is a corrupt heart that doth not chew truth by meditation. A natural man is
said not to know God, or the things of God; he may know them nationally, but he knows them not
affectionately. A sensual soul can have no delight in a spiritual law. To be sensual and not to have the
Spirit are inseparable (Jude 19). Natural men may indeed meditate upon the law and truth of God, but
without delight in it; if they take any pleasure in it, it is only as it is knowledge, not as it is a rule; for we
delight in nothing that we desire, but upon the same account that we desire it. Natural men desire to know
God and some part of his will and law, not out of a sense of their practical excellency, but a natural thirst
after knowledge: and if they have a delight, it is in the act of knowing, not in the object known, not in the
duties that stream from that knowledge; they design the furnishing their understandings, not the
quickening their affections,—like idle boys that strike fire, not to warm themselves by the heat, but sport
themselves with the sparks; whereas a gracious soul accounts not only his meditation, or the operations of
his soul about God and his will to be sweet, but he hath a joy in the object of that meditation.163 Many
have the knowledge of God, who have no delight in him or his will. Owls have eyes to perceive that there
is a sun, but by reason of the weakness of their sight have no pleasure to look upon a beam of it: so
neither can a man by nature love, or delight in the will of God, because of his natural corruption. That law
that riseth up in men for conviction and instruction, they keep down under the power of corruption;
making their souls not the sanctuary, but prison of truth (Rom. 1:18). They will keep it down in their
hearts, if they cannot keep it out of their heads, and will not endeavor to know and taste the spirit of it.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) There is, further, a rising and swelling of the heart against the will of God. 1st. Internal. God’s law
cast against a hard heart, is like a ball thrown against a stone wall, by reason of the resistance rebounding
the further from it; the meeting of a divine truth and the heart of man, is like the meeting of two tides, the
weaker swells and foams. We have a natural antipathy against a divine rule, and therefore when it is
clapped close to our consciences, there is a snuffing at it, high reasonings against it, corruption breaks out
more strongly: as water poured on lime sets it on fire by an antiperistasis, and the more water is cast upon
it, the more furiously it burns; or as the sunbeams shining upon a dunghill make the steams the thicker,
and the stench the noisomer, neither being the positive cause of the smoke in the lime, or the stench in the
dunghill, but by accident the causes of the eruption: (Rom. 7:8), “But sin taking occasion by the
commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence, for without the law sin was dead.” Sin was in
a languishing posture, as if it were dead, like a lazy garrison in a city, till, upon an alarm from the
adversary, it takes arms, and revives its courage; all the sin in the heart gathers together its force to
maintain its standing, like the vapors of the night, which unite themselves more closely to resist the beams
of the rising sun. Deep conviction often provokes fierce opposition; sometimes disputes against a divine
rule end in blasphemies: (Acts 13:45), “contradicting and blaspheming” are coupled together. Men
naturally desire things that are forbidden, and reject things commanded, from the corruption of nature,
which affects an unbounded liberty, and is impatient of returning under that yoke it hath shaken off, and
therefore rageth against the bars of the law, as the waves roar against the restraint of a bank. When the
understanding is dark, and the mind ignorant, sin lies as dead; “A man scarce knows he hath such motions
of concupiscence in him, he finds not the least breath of wind, but a full calm in his soul; but when he is
awakened by the law, then the viciousness of nature being sensible of an invasion of its empire, arms
itself against the divine law, and the more the command is urged, the more vigorously it bends its
strength, and more insolently lifts up itself against it;”164 he perceives more and more atheistical lusts than
before; “all manner of concupiscence,” more leprous and contagious than before. When there are any
motions to turn to God, a reluctancy is presently perceived; atheistical thoughts bluster in the mind like
the wind, they know not whence they come, nor whither they go; so unapt is the heart to any
acknowledgment of God as his ruler, and any re-union with him. Hence men are said to resist the Holy
Ghost (Acts 7:51), to fall against it, as the word signifies, as a stone, or any ponderous body falls against
that which lies in its way: they would dash to pieces, or grind to powder that very motion which is made
for their instruction, and the Spirit too which makes it, and that not from a fit of passion, but an habitual
repugnance; “Ye always resist,” &amp;c. 2d. External. It is a fruit of atheism in the fourth verse of this psalm,
“Who eat up my people as they eat bread.” How do the revelations of the mind of God meet with
opposition! and the carnal world like dogs bark against the shining of the moon; so much men hate the
light, that they spurn at the lanthorns that bear it; and because they cannot endure the treasure, often fling
the earthen vessels against the ground wherein it is held. If the entrance of truth render the market worse
for Diana’s shrines, the whole city will be in an uproar.165 When Socrates upon natural principles confuted
the heathen idolatry, and asserted the unity of God, the whole cry of Athens, a learned university, is
against him; and because he opposed the public received religion, though with an undoubted truth, he
must end his life by violence. How hath every corner of the world steamed with the blood of those that
would maintain the authority of God in the world! The devil’s children will follow the steps of their
father, and endeavor to bruise the heel of divine truth, that would endeavor to break the head of corrupt
lust.
</p>
<p>
     (5.) Men often seem desirous to be acquainted with the will of God, not out of any respect to his will,
and to make it their rule, but upon some other consideration. Truth is scarce received as truth. There is
more of hypocrisy than sincerity in the pale of the church, and attendance on the mind of God. The
outward dowry of a religious profession, makes it often more desirable than the beauty. Judas was a
follower of Christ for the bag, not out of any affection to the divine revelation. Men sometime pretend a
desire to be acquainted with the will of God, to satisfy their own passions, rather than to conform to God’s
will; the religion of such is not the judgment of the man, but the passion of the brute. Many entertain a
doctrine for the person’s sake, rather than a person for the doctrine’s sake, and believe a thing because it
comes from a man they esteem, as if his lips were more canonical than Scripture. The Apostle implies in
the commendation he gives the Thessalonians,166 that some receive the word for human interest, not as it
is in truth the word and will of God to command and govern their consciences by its sovereign authority;
or else they have the “truth of God” (as St. James speaks of the faith of Christ) “with respect of
persons;”167 and receive it not for the sake of the fountain, but of the channel; so that many times the same
truth delivered by another, is disregarded, which, when dropping from the fancy and mouth of a man’s
own idol, is cried up as an oracle. This is to make not God, but man the rule; for though we entertain that
which materially is the truth of God, yet not formally as his truth, but as conveyed by one we affect; and
that we receive a truth and not an error, we owe the obligation to the honesty of the instrument, and not to
the strength and clearness of our own judgment. Wrong considerations may give admittance to an
unclean, as well as a clean beast into the ark of the soul. That which is contrary to the mind of God, may
be entertained, as well as that which is agreeable. It is all one to such that have no respect to God, what
they have, as it is all one to a sponge to suck up the foulest water or the sweetest wine, when either is
applied to it.
</p>
<p>
     (6). Many that entertain the notions of the will and mind of God, admit them with unsettled and
wavering affections. There is a great levity in the heart of man. The Jews that one day applaud our
Saviour with hosannahs as their king, vote his crucifixion the next, and use him as a murderer. We begin
in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Our hearts, like lute-strings, are changed with every change of weather,
with every appearance of a temptation; scarce one motion of God in a thousand prevails with us for a
settled abode. It is a hard task to make a signature of those truths upon our affections, which will with
ease pass current with our understandings; our affections will as soon lose them, as our understandings
embrace them. The heart of man is “unstable as water.”168 Some were willing to rejoice in John’s light,
which reflected a lustre on their minds; but not in his heat, which would have conveyed a warmth to their
hearts; and the light was pleasing to them but for a season,169 while their corruptions lay as if they were
dead, not when they were awakened. Truth may be admitted one day, and the next day rejected; as Austin
saith of a wicked man, he loves the truth shining, but he hates the truth reproving. This is not to make
God, but our own humor, our rule and measure.
</p>
<p>
     (7.) Many desire an acquaintance with the law and truth of God, with a design to improve some lust
by it; to turn the word of God to be a pander to the breach of his law. This is so far from making God’s
will our rule, that we make our own vile affections the rule of his law. How many forced interpretations of
Scripture have been coined to give content to the lusts of men, and the vine rule forced to bend, and be
squared to men’s loose and carnal apprehensions! It is a part of the instability or falseness of the heart, to
“wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction;”170 which they could not do, if they did not first wring
them to countenance some detestable error or filthy crime. In Paradise the first interpretation made of the
first law of God, was point blank against the mind of the Lawgiver, and venomous to the whole race of
mankind. Paul himself feared that some might put his doctrine of grace to so ill a use, as to be an altar and
sanctuary to shelter their presumption (Rom. 6:1, 15): “Shall we then continue in sin, that grace may
abound?” Poisonous consequences are often drawn from the sweetest truths; as when God’s patience is
made a topic whence to argue against his providence,171 or an encouragement to commit evil more
greedily; as though because he had not presently a revenging hand, he had not an all-seeing eye or when
the doctrine of justification by faith is made use of to depress a holy life; or God’s readiness to receive
returning sinners, an encouragement to defer repentance till a death-bed. A liar will hunt for shelter in the
reward God gave the midwives that lied to Pharaoh for the preservation of the males of Israel, and
Rahab’s saving the spies by false intelligence. God knows how to distinguish between grace and
corruption, that may lie close together; or between some thing of moral goodness and moral evil, which
may be mixed; we find their fidelity rewarded, which was a moral good; but not their lie approved, which
was a moral evil. Nor will Christ’s conversing with sinners, be a plea for any to thrust themselves into evil
company. Christ conversed with sinners, as a physician with diseased persons, to cure them, not approve
them; others with profligate persons, to receive infection from them, not to communicate holiness to
them. Satan’s children have studied their father’s art, who wanted not perverted Seripture to second his
temptations against our Saviour.172 How often do carnal hearts turn divine revelation to carnal ends, as the
sea fresh water into salt! As men subject the precepts of God to carnal interests, so they subject the truths
of God to carnal fancies. When men will allegorize the word, and make a humorous and crazy fancy the
interpreter of divine oracles, and not the Spirit speaking in the word; this is to enthrone our own
imaginations as the rule of God’s law, and depose his law from being the rule of our reason; this is to rifle
truth of its true mind and intent. ’Tis more to rob a man of his reason, the essential constitutive part of
man, than of his estate; this is to refuse an intimate acquaintance with his will. We shall never tell what is
the matter of a precept, or the matter of a promise, if we impose a sense upon it contrary to the plain
meaning of it; thereby we shall make the law of God to have a distinct sense according to the variety of
men’s imaginations, and so make every man’s fancy a law to himself. Now that this unwillingness to have
a spiritual acquaintance with divine truth is a disowning God as our rule, and a setting up self in his stead,
is evident; because this unwillingness respects truth.
</p>
<p>
     1st. As it is most spiritual and holy. A fleshly mind is most contrary to a spiritual law, and particularly
as it is a searching and discovering law, that would dethrone all other rules in the soul. As men love to be
without a holy God in the world, so they love to be without a holy law, the transcript and image of God’s
holiness in their hearts; and without holy men, the lights kindled by the Father of lights. As the holiness of
God, so the holiness of the law most offends a carnal heart (Isa. 30:11): “Cause the Holy One of Israel to
cease from before us, prophesy to us right things.” They could not endure God as a holy one. Herein God
places their rebellion, rejecting him as their rule (ver. 9), “Rebellious children, that will not hear the law
of the Lord.” The more pure and precious any discovery of God is, the more it is disrelished by the world:
as spiritual sins are sweetest to a carnal heart, so spiritual truths are most distasteful. The more of the
brightness of the sun any beam conveys, the more offensive it is to a distempered eye.
</p>
<p>
    2d. As it doth most relate to, or lead to God. The devil directs his fiercest batteries against those
doctrines in the word, and those graces in the heart, which most exalt God, debase man, and bring men to
the lowest subjection to their Creator; such is the doctrine and grace of justifying faith. That men hate not
knowledge as knowledge, but as it directs them to choose the fear of the Lord, was the determination of
the Holy Ghost long ago (Prov. 1:29): “For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the
Lord.” Whatsoever respects God, clears up guilt, witnesses man’s revolt to him, rouseth up conscience,
and moves to a return to God, a man naturally runs from, as Adam did from God, and seeks a shelter in
some weak bushes of error, rather than appear before it. Not that men are unwilling to inquire into and
contemplate some divine truths which lie furthest from the heart, and concern not themselves immediately
with the rectifying the soul: they may view them with such a pleasure as some might take in beholding the
miracles of our Saviour, who could not endure his searching doctrine. The light of speculation may be
pleasant, but the light of conviction is grievous; that which galls their consciences, and would affect them
with a sense of their duty to God. Is it not easy to perceive, that when a man begins to be serious in the
concerns of the honor of God and the duty of his soul, he feels a reluctancy within him, even against the
pleas of conscience; which evidenceth that some unworthy principle has got footing in the hearts of men,
which fights against the declarations of God without, and the impressions of the law of God within, at the
same time when a man’s own conscience takes part with it, which is the substance of the apostle’s
discourse, Rom. 7:15, 16, &amp;c. Close discourses of the honor of God, and our duty to him, are irksome
when men are apon a merry pin: they are like a damp in a mine, that takes away their breath; they shuffle
them out as soon as they can, and are as unwilling to retain the speech of them in their mouths, as the
knowledge of them in their hearts. Gracious speeches, instead of bettering many men, distemper them, as
sometimes sweet perfumes affect a weak head with aches.
</p>
<p>
    3d. As it is most contrary to self. Men are unwilling to acquaint themselves with any truth that leads to
God, because it leads from self. Every part of the will of God is more or less displeasing, as it sounds
harsh against some carnal interest men would set above God, or as a mate with him. Man cannot desire
any intimacy with that law which he regards as a bird of prey, to pick out his right eye or gnaw off his
right hand, his lust dearer than himself. The reason we have such hard thoughts of God’s will is, because
we have such high thoughts of ourselves. It is a hard matter to believe or will that which hath no affinity
with some principle in the understanding, and no interest in our will and passions: our unwillingness to be
acquainted with the will of God ariseth from the disproportion between that and our corrupt hearts; “We
are alienated from the life of God in our minds” (Eph. 4:18, 19). As we live not like God, so we neither
think or will as God; there is an antipathy in the heart of man against that doctrine which teaches us to
deny ourselves and be under the rule of another; but whatsoever favors the ambition, lusts, and profits of
men, is easy entertainable. Many are fond of those sciences which may enrich their understandings, and
grate not upon their sensual delights. Many have an admirable dexterity in finding out philosophical
reasons, mathematical demonstrations, or raising observations upon the records of history; and spend
much time and many serious and affectionate thoughts in the study of them. In those they have not
immediately to do with God, their beloved pleasures are not impaired; it is a satisfaction to self without
the exercise of any hostility against it. But had those sciences been against self, as much as the law and
will of God, they had long since been rooted out of the world. Why did the young man turn his back upon
the law of Christ? because of his worldly self. Why did the Pharisees mock at the doctrine of our Saviour,
and not at their own traditions? because of covetous self. Why did the Jews slight the person of our
Saviour and put him to death, after the reading so many credentials of his being sent from heaven?
because of ambitious self, that the Romans might not come and take away their kingdom. If the law of
God were fitted to the humors of self, it would be readily and cordially observed by all men: self is the
measure of a world of seeming religious actions; while God seems to be the object, and his law the
motive, self is the rule and end (Zech. 7:5): “Did you fast unto me,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
     2. As men discover their disowning the will of God as a rule by unwillingness to be acquainted with it,
so they discover it, by the contempt of it after they cannot avoid the notions and some impressions of it.
The rule of God is burthensome to a sinner; he flies from it as from a frightful bugbear, and unpleasant
yoke: sin against the knowledge of the law is therefore called a going back from the commandment of
God’s lips (Job 23:12): “A casting God’s word behind them,”173 as a contemptible thing, fitter to be
trodden in the dirt than lodged in the heart; nay it is a casting it off as an abominable thing, for so the
word ‫ ונח‬signifies, Hos. 8:3. “Israel hath cast off the thing that is good;” an utter refusal of God (Jer.
44:16): “As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken.” In
the slight of his precepts his essential perfections are slighted. In disowning his will as a rule, we disown
all those attributes which flow from his will, as goodness, righteousness, and truth. As an act of the divine
understanding is supposed to precede the act of the divine will, so we slight the infinite reason of God.
Every law, though it proceeds from the will of the lawgiver, and doth formally consist in an act of the
will, yet it doth pre-suppose an act of the understanding. If the commandment be holy, just, and good, as
it is (Rom. 7:12); if it be the image of God’s holiness, a transcript of his righteousness, and the efflux of
his goodness; then in every reach of it, dirt is cast upon those attributes which shine in it; and a slight of
all the regards he hath to his own honor, and all the provisions he makes for his creature. This atheism, or
contempt of God, is more taken notice of by God than the matter of the sin itself; as a respect to God in a
weak and imperfect obedience is more than the matter of the obedience itself, because it is an
acknowledgment of God; so a contempt of God in an act of disobedience, is more than the matter of the
disobedience. The creature stands in such an act not only in a posture of distance from God, but defiance
of him; it was not the bare act of murder and adultery which Nathan charged upon David, but the
atheistical principle which spirited those evil acts. The despising the commandment of the Lord was the
venom of them.174 It is possible to break a law without contempt; but when men pretend to believe there is
a God, and that this is the law of God, it shows a contempt of his majesty:175 men naturally account God’s
laws too strict, his yoke too heavy, and his limits too strait; and he that liveth in a contempt of this law,
curseth God in his life. How can they believe there is a God, who despise him as a ruler? How can they
believe him to be a guide, that disdain to follow him? To think we firmly believe a God without living
conformable to his law, is an idle and vain imagination. The true and sensible notion of a God cannot
subsist with disorder and an affected unrighteousness. This contempt is seen,
</p>
<p>
     1. In any presumptuous breach of any part of his law. Such sins are frequently called in Scripture,
rebellions, which are a denial of the allegiance we owe to him. By a wilful refusal of his right in one part,
we root up the foundation of that rule he doth justly challenge over us; his right is as extensive to
command us in one thing, as in another; and if it be disowned in one thing, it is virtually disowned in all,
and the whole statute book of God is contemned (James 2:10, 11): “Whosoever shall keep the whole law
and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.” A willing breaking one part, though there be a willing
observance of all the other points of it, is a breach of the whole; because the authority of God, which gives
sanction to the whole, is slighted: the obedience to the rest is dissembled: for the love, which is the root of
all obedience, is wanting; for “love is the fulfilling the whole law.”176 The rest are obeyed because they
cross not carnal desire so much as the other, and so it is an observance of himself, not of God. Besides,
the authority of God, which is not prevalent to restrain us from the breach of one point, would be of as
little force with us to restrain us from the breach of all the rest, did the allurements of the flesh give us as
strong a diversion from the one as from the other; and though the command that is transgressed be the
least in the whole law, yet the authority which enjoins it is the same with that which enacts the greatest:
and it is not so much the matter of the command, as the authority commanding which lays the obligation.
</p>
<p>
    2. In the natural averseness to the declarations of God’s will and mind, which way soever they tend.
Since man affected to be as God, he desires to be boundless; he would not have fetters, though they be
golden ones, and conduce to his happiness. Thought the law of God be a strength to them, yet they will
not (Isa. 30:15): “In returning shall be your strength, and you would not.” They would not have a bridle to
restrain them from running into the pit, nor be hedged in by the law, though for their security; as if they
thought it too slavish and low-spirited a thing to be guided by the will of another. Hence man is compared
to a wild ass, that loves to “snuff up the wind in the wilderness at her pleasure,” rather than come under
the “guidance of God;”177 from whatsoever quarter of the heavens you pursue her she will run to the
other. The Israelites “could not endure what was commanded,”178 though in regard of the moral part,
agreeable to what they found written in their own nature, and to the observance whereof they had the
highest obligations of any people under heaven, since God had, by many prodigies, delivered them from a
cruel slavery, the memory of which prefaced the Decalogue (Exod. 20:2), “I am the Lord thy God, which
have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” They could not think of the rule
of their duty, but they must reflect upon the grand incentive of it in their redemption from Egyptian
thraldom; yet this people were cross to God, which way soever he moved. When they were in the brick
kilns, they cried for deliverance; when they had heavenly manna, they longed for their onions and garlic.
In Num. 14:3, they repent of their deliverance from Egypt, and talk of returning again to seek the remedy
of their evils in the hands of their cruellest enemies, and would rather put themselves into the irons,
whence God had delivered them, than believe one word of the promise of God for giving them a fruitful
land; but when Moses tells them God’s order, that they should turn back by the way of the Red Sea,179
and that God had confrmed it by an oath, that they should not see the land of Canaan,180 they then run
cross to this command of God, and, instead of marching towards the Red Sea, which they had wished for
before, they will go up to Canaan, as in spite of God and his threatening: “We will go to the place which
the Lord hath promised” (ver. 40), which Moses calls a transgressing the commandment of the Lord (ver.
41). They would presume to go up, notwithstanding Moses’ prohibition, and are smitten by the
Amalekites. When God gives them a precept, with a promise to go up to Canaan, they long for Egypt;
when God commands them to return to the Red Sea, which was nearer to the place they longed for, they
will shift sides, and go up to Canaan;181 and when they found they were to traverse the solitudes of the
desert, they took pet against God, and, instead of thanking him for the late victory against the Canaanites,
they reproach him for his conduct from Egypt, and the manna wherewith he nourished them in the
wilderness. They would not go to Canaan, the way God had chosen, nor preserve themselves by the
means God had ordained. They would not be at God’s disposal, but complain of the badness of the way,
and the lightness of manna, empty of any necessary juice to sustain their nature. They murmuringly solicit
the will and power of God to change all that order which he had resolved in his counsel, and take another,
conformable to their vain foolish desires; and they signified thereby that they would invade his conduct,
and that he should act according to their fancy, which the psalmist calls a “tempting of God, and limiting
the Holy One of Israel” (Psalm 78:41). To what point soever the declarations of God stand, the will of
man turns the quite contrary way. Is not the carriage of this nation the best then in the world? a discovery
of the depth of our natural corruption, how cross man is to God? And that charge God brings against
them, may be brought against all men by nature, that they despise his judgments, and have a rooted
abhorrency of his statutes in their soul (Lev. 26:43). No sooner had they recovered from one rebellion, but
they revolted to another; so difficult a thing it is for man’s nature to be rendered capable of conforming to
the will of God. The carriage of this people is but a copy of the nature of mankind, and is “written for our
admonition” (1 Cor. 10:11). From this temper men are said to make “void the law of God;”182 to make it
of no obligation, an antiquated and moth-eaten record. And the Pharisees, by setting up their traditions
against the will of God, are said to make his law of “none effect;” to strip it of all its authority, as the
word signifies, (Matt. 15:6,) ἠκυρώσατε.
</p>
<p>
     3. We have the greatest slight of that will of God which is most for his honor and his greatest pleasure.
It is the nature of man, ever since Adam, to do so (Hos. 6:6, 7). God desired mercy and not a sacrifice; the
knowledge of himself more than burnt offering; but they, like men as Adam, have transgressed the
covenant, invade God’s rights, and not let him be Lord of one tree. We are more curious observers of the
fringes of the law than of the greater concerns of it. The Jews were diligent in sacrifices and offerings,
which God did not urge upon them as principals, but as types of other things; but negligent of the faith
which was to be established by him. Holiness, mercy, pity, which concerned the honor of God, as
governor of the world, and were imitations of the holiness and goodness of God, they were strangers to.
This is God’s complaint (Isa. 1:11, 12, 16, 17). We shall find our hearts most averse to the observation of
those laws which are eternal, and essential to righteousness; such that he could not but command, as he is
a righteous Governor; in the observation of which we come nearest to him, and express his image more
clearly; as those laws for an inward and spiritual worship, a supreme affection to him. God, in regard of
his righteousness and holiness of his nature, and the excellency of his being, could not command the
contrary to these. But this part of his will our hearts most swell against, our corruption doth most snarl at;
whereas those laws which are only positive, and have no intrinsic righteousness in them, but depend
purely upon the will of the Lawgiver, and may be changed at his pleasure (which the other, that have an
intrinsic righteousness in them, cannot), we better comply with, than that part of his will that doth express
more the righteousness of his nature;183 such as the ceremonial part of worship, and the ceremonial law
among the Jews. We are more willing to observe order in some outward attendances and glavering
devotions, than discard secret affections to evil, crucify inward lusts and delightful thoughts. A “hanging
down the head like a bullrush” is not difficult; but the “breaking the heart,” like a potter’s vessel, to shreds
and dust (a sacrifice God delights in, whereby the excellency of God and the vileness of the creature is
owned), goes against the grain; to cut off an outward branch is not so hard as to hack at the root. What
God most loathes, as most contrary to his will, we most love: no sin did God so severely hate, and no sin
were the Jews more inclined unto, than that of idolatry. The heathen had not changed their God, as the
Jews had changed their glory (Jer. 2:11); and all men are naturally tainted with this sin, which is so
contrary to the holy and excellent nature of God. By how much the more defect there is of purity in our
respects to God, by so much the more respect there is to some idol within or without us, to humor,
custom, and interest, &amp;c. Never did any law of God meet with so much opposition as Christianity, which
was the design of God from the first promise to the exhibiting the Redeemer, and from thence to the end
of the world. All people drew swords at first against it. The Romans prepared yokes for their neighbors,
but provided temples for the idols those people worshipped; but Christianity, the choicest design and most
delightful part of the will of God, never met with a kind entertainment at first in any place; Rome, that
entertained all others, persecuted this with fire and sword, though sealed by greater testimonies from
heaven than their own records could report in favor of their idols.
</p>
<p>
     4. In running the greatest hazards, and exposing ourselves to more trouble to cross the will of God,
than is necessary to the observance of it. It is a vain charge men bring against the divine precepts, that
they are rigorous, severe, difficult; when, besides the contradiction to our Saviour, who tells us his “yoke
is easy,” and his “burthen light,” they thwart their own calm reason and judgment. Is there not more
difficulty to be vicious, covetous, violent, cruel, than to be virtuous, charitable, kind? Doth the will of
God enjoin that that is not conformable to right reason, and secretly delightful in the exercise and issue?
And on the contrary, what doth Satan and the world engage us in, that is not full of molestation and
hazard? Is it a sweet and comely thing to combat continually against our own consciences, and resist our
own light, and commence a perpetual quarrel against ourselves, as we ordinarily do when we sin? They in
the Prophet (Micah 6:6–8) would be at the expense of “thousands of rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil,”
if they could compass them; yea, would strip themselves of their natural affection to their first-born to
expiate the “sin of their soul,” rather than to “do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God;” things
more conducible to the honor of God, the welfare of the world, the security of their souls, and of a more
easy practice than the offerings they wished for. Do not men then disown God when they will walk in
ways hedged with thorns, wherein they meet with the arrows of conscience, at every turn, in their sides;
and slide down to an everlasting punishment, sink under an intolerable slavery, to contradict the will of
God? when they will prefer a sensual satisfaction, with a combustion in their consciences, violation of
their reasons, gnawing cares and weary travels before the honor of God, the dignity of their natures, the
happiness of peace and health, which might be preserved at a cheaper rate, than they are at to destroy
them?
</p>
<p>
    5. In the unwillingness and awkwardness of the heart, when it is to pay God a service. Men “do evil
with both hands earnestly,”184 but do good with one hand faintly; no life in the heart, nor any diligence in
the hand. What slight and loose thoughts of God doth this unwillingness imply? It is a wrong to his
providence, as though we were not under his government, and had no need of his assistance; a wrong to
his excellency, as though there were no amiableness in him to make his service desirable; an injury to his
goodness and power, as if he were not able or willing to reward the creatures’ obedience, or careless not
to take notice of it; it is a sign we receive little satisfaction in him, and that there is a great unsuitableness
between him and us.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) There is a kind of constraint in the first engagement. We are rather pressed to it than enter
ourselves volunteers. What we call service to God is done naturally much against our wills; it is not a
delightful food, but a bitter potion; we are rather haled, than run to it. There is a contradiction of sin
within us against our service, as there was a contradiction of sinners without our Saviour against his doing
the will of God. Our hearts are unwieldy to any spiritual service of God; we are fain to use a violence with
them sometimes: Hezekiah, it is said, “walked before the Lord, with a perfect heart” (2 Kings 20:9); he
walked, he made himself to walk: man naturally cares not for a walk with God; if he hath any communion
with him, it is with such a dulness and heaviness of spirit as if he wished himself out of his company.
Man’s nature, being contrary to holiness, hath an aversion to any act of homage to God, because holiness
must at least be pretended. In every duty wherein we have a communion with God, holiness is requisite:
now as men are against the truth of holiness, because it is unsuitable to them, so they are not friends to
those duties which require it, and for some space divert them from the thoughts of their beloved lusts. The
word of the Lord is a yoke, prayer a drudgery, obedience a strange element. We are like fish, that “drink
up iniquity like water,”185 and come not to the bank without the force of an angle; no more willing to do
service for God, than a fish is of itself to do service for man. It is a constrained act to satisfy conscience,
and such are servile, not son-like performances, and spring from bondage more than affection; if
conscience, like a task-master, did not scourge them to duty, they would never perform it. Let us appeal to
ourselves, whether we are not more unwilling to secret, closet, hearty duty to God, than to join with others
in some external service; as if those inward services were a going to the rack, and rather our penance than
privilege. How much service hath God in the world from the same principle that vagrants perform their
task in Bridewell! How glad are many of evasions to back them in the neglect of the commands of God,
of corrupt reasonings from the flesh to waylay an act of obedience, and a multitude of excuses to blunt the
edge of the precept! The very service of God shall be a pretence to deprive him of the obedience due to
him. Saul will not be ruled by God’s will in the destroying the cattle of the Amalekites, but by his own;
and will impose upon the will and wisdom of God, judging God mistaken in his command, and that the
cattle God thought fittest to be meat to the fowls, were fitter to be sacrifices on the altar.186 If we do
perform any part of his will, is it not for our own ends, to have some deliverance from trouble? (Isa.
26:16): “In trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.”
In affliction, he shall find them kneeling in homage and devotion; in prosperity, he shall feel them kicking
with contempt; they can pour out a prayer in distress, and scarce drop one when they are delivered.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) There is a slightness in our service of God. We are loth to come into his presence; and when we
do come, we are loth to continue with him. We pay not an homage to him heartily, as to our Lord and
Governor; we regard him not as our Master, whose work we ought to do, and whose honor we ought to
aim at. 1. In regard of the matter of service. When the torn, the lame, and the sick is offered to Gods;187 so
thin and lean a sacrifice, that you may have thrown it to the ground with a puff; so some understand the
meaning of “you have snuffed at it.” Men have naturally such slight thoughts of the majesty and law of
God, that they think any service is good enough for him, and conformable to his law. The dullest and
deadest time we think fittest to pay God a service in; when sleep is ready to close our eyes, and we are
unfit to serve ourselves, we think it a fit time to open our hearts to God. How few morning sacrifices hath
God from many persons and families! Men leap out of their beds to their carnal pleasures or worldly
employments, without any thought of their Creator and Preserver, or any reflection upon his will as the
rule of our daily obedience. And as many reserve the dregs of their lives, their old age, to offer up their
souls to God, so they reserve the dregs of the day, their sleeping time, for the offering up their service to
him. How many grudge to spend their best time in the serving the will of God, and reserve for him the
sickly and rheumatic part of their lives; the remainder of that which the devil and their own lusts have fed
upon! Would not any prince or governor judge a present half eaten up by wild beasts, or that which died
in a ditch, a contempt of his royalty? A corrupt thing is too base and vile for so great a King as God is,
whose name is dreadful.188 When by age men are weary of their own bodies, they would present them to
God; yet grudgingly, as if a tired body were too good for him, snuffing at the command for service. God
calls for our best, and we give him the worst. 2. In respect of frame. We think any frame will serve God’s
turn, which speaks our slight of God as a Ruler. Man naturally performs duty with an unholy heart,
whereby it becomes an abomination to God (Prov. 28:9): “He that turns away his ear from hearing the
law, even his prayers shall be an abomination to God.” The services which he commands, he hates for
their evil frames or corrupt ends (Amos 5:21): “I hate, I despise your feast-days, I will not smell in your
solemn assemblies.” God requires gracious services, and we give him corrupt ones. We do not rouse up
our hearts, as David called upon his lute and harp to awake (Psalm 57:8). Our hearts are not given to him;
we put him off with bodily exercise. The heart is but ice to what it doth not affect, [1.] There is not that
natural vigor in the observance of God, which we have in worldly business. When we see a liveliness in
men in other things, change the scene into a motion towards God, how suddenly doth their vigor shrink
and their hearts freeze into sluggishness! Many times we serve God as languishingly as if we were afraid
he should accept us, and pray as coldly as if we were unwilling he should hear us, and take away that lust
by which we are governed, and which conscience forces us to pray against; as if we were afraid God
should set up his own throne and government in our hearts. How fleeting are we in divine meditation,
how sleepy in spiritual exercises! but in other exercises active. The soul Both not awaken itself, and excite
those animal and vital spirits, which it will in bodily recreations and sports; much less the powers of the
soul: whereby it is evident we prefer the latter before any service to God. Since there is a fulness of
animal spirits, why might they not be excited in holy duties as well as in other operations, but that there is
a reluctancy in the soul to exercise its supremacy in this case, and perform anything becoming a creature
in subjection to God as a Ruler? [2.] It is evident also in the distractions we have in his service. How loth
are we to serve God fixedly one hour, nay a part of an hour, notwithstanding all the thoughts of his
majesty, and the eternity of glory set before our eye! What man is there, since the fall of Adam, that
served God one hour without many wanderings and unsuitable thoughts unfit for that service? How ready
are our hearts to start out and unite themselves with any worldly objects that please us! [3.] Weariness in
it evidenceth it. To be weary of our dulness signifies a desire, to be weary of service signifies a discontent,
to be ruled by God. How tired are we in the performance of spiritual duties, when in the vain triflings of
time we have a perpetual motion! How will many willingly revel whole nights, when their hearts will flag
at the threshold of a religious service! like Dagon,189 lose both our heads to think, and hands to act, when
the ark of God is present. Some in the Prophet wished the new moon and the Sabhath over, that they
might sell their corn, and be busied again in their worldly affairs.190 A slight and weariness of the
Sabhath, was a slight of the Lord of the Sabhath, and of that freedom from the yoke and rule of sin, which
was signified by it. The design of the sacrifices in the new moon was to signify a rest from the tyranny of
sin, and a consecration to the spiritual service of God. Servants that are quickly weary of their work, are
weary of the authority of their master that enjoins it. If our hearts had a value for God, it would be with us
as with the needle to the loadstone; there would be upon his beck a speedy motion to him, and a fixed
union with him. When the judgments and affections of the saints shall be fully refined in glory, they shall
be willing to behold the face of God, and be under his government to eternity, without any weariness: as
the holy angels have owned God as their sovereign near these six thousand years, without being weary of
running on his errands. But, alas, while the flesh clogs us, there will be some relics of unwillingness to
hear his injunctions, and weariness in performing them; though men may excuse those things by extrinsic
causes, yet God’s unerring judgment calls it a weariness of himself (Isaiah 43:22): “Thou hast not called
upon me, O Jacob, but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.” Of this he taxeth his own people, when he
tells them he would have the beasts of the field, the dragons and the owls—the Gentiles, that the Jews
counted no better than such—to honor him and acknowledge him their rule in a way of duty (ver. 20, 21.)
</p>
<p>
     6. This contempt is seen in a deserting the rule of God, when our expectations are not answered upon
our service. When services are performed from carnal principles, they are soon cast off when carnal ends
meet not with desired satisfaction. But when we own ourselves God’s servants and God our Master, “our
eyes will wait upon him till he have mercy on us.”191 It is one part of the duty we owe to God as our
Master in heaven to continue in prayer (Col. 4:1, 2); and by the same reason in all other service, and to
watch in the same with thanksgiving: to watch for occasions of praise, to watch with cheerfulness for
further manifestations of his will, strength to perform it, success in the performance, that we may from all
draw matter of praise. As we are in a posture of obedience to his precepts, so we should be in a posture of
waiting for the blessing of it. But naturally we reject the duty we owe to God, if he do not speed the
blessing we expect from him. How many do secretly mutter the same as they in Job 21:15: “What is the
Almighty that we should serve him, and what profit shall we have if we pray to him?” They serve not God
out of conscience to his commands, but for some carnal profit; and if God make them to wait for it, they
will not stay his leisure, but cease soliciting him any longer. Two things are expressed;—that God was not
worthy of any homage from them,—“What is the Almighty that we should serve him?” and that the
service of him would not bring them in a good revenue or an advantage of that kind they expected.
Interest drives many men on to some kind of service, and when they do not find an advance of that, they
will acknowledge God no more; but like some beggars, if you give them not upon their asking, and
calling you good master, from blessing they will turn to cursing. How often do men do that secretly,
practically, if not plainly, which Job’s wife advised him to, curse God, and cast off that disguise of
integrity they had assumed! (Job 2:9): “Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God.” What a stir, and
pulling, and crying is here! Cast off all thoughts of religious service, and be at daggers drawing with that
God, who for all thy service of him has made thee so wretched a spectacle to men, and a banquet for
worms. The like temper is deciphered in the Jews (Mal. 3:14), “It is in vain to serve God, and what profit
is it that we have kept his ordinances, that we have walked mournfully before the Lord?” What profit is it
that we have regarded his statutes, and carried ourselves in a way of subjection to God, as our Sovereign,
when we inherit nothing but sorrow, and the idolatrous neighbors swim in all kind of pleasures? as if it
were the most miserable thing to acknowledge God? If men have not the benefits they expect, they think
God unrighteous in himself, and injurious to them, in not conferring the favor they imagine they have
merited; and if they have not that recompense, they will deny God that subjection they owe to him as
creatures. Grace moves to God upon a sense of duty; corrupt nature apon a sense of interest. Sincerity is
encouraged by gracious returns, but is not melted away by God’s delay or refusal. Corrupt nature would
have God at its back, and steers a course of duty by hope of some carnal profit, not by a sense of the
sovereignty of God.
</p>
<p>
     7. This contempt is seen in breaking promises with God. “One while the conscience of a man makes
vows of new obedience, and perhaps binds himself with many an oath; but they prove like Jonah’s purd,
withering the next day after their birth. This was Pharaohs temper: under a storm he would submit to God,
and let Israel go; but when the storm is ended, he will not be under God’s control, and Israel’s slavery
shall be increased. The fear of Divine wrath makes many a sinner turn his back upon his sin, and the love
of his ruling lust makes him turn his back upon his true Lord. This is from the prevalency of sin, that
disputes with God for the sovereignty.”192 When God hath sent a sharp disease, as a messenger to bind
men to their beds, and make an interruption of their sinful pleasures, their mouths are full of promises of a
new life, in hope to escape the just vengeance of God: the sense of hell, which strikes strongly upon them,
makes them full of such pretended resolutions when they howl upon their beds. But if God be pleased in
his patience to give them a respite, to take off the chains wherewith he seemed to be binding them for
destruction, and recruit their strength, they are more earnest in their sins than they were in their promises
of a reformation, as if they had got the mastery of God, and had outwitted him. How often doth God
charge them of not returning to him after a succession of judgments!193 So hard it is, not only to allure,
but to scourge men, to an acknowledgment of God as their Ruler!
</p>
<p>
     Consider then, are we not naturally inclined to disobey the known will of God? Can we say, Lord, for
thy sake we refrain the thing to which our hearts incline? Do we not allow ourselves to be licentious,
earthly, vain, proud, revengeful, though we know it will offend him? Have we not been peevishly cross to
his declared will? run counter to him and those laws which express most of the glory of his holiness? Is
not this to disown him as our rule? Did we never wish there were no law to bind us, no precept to check
our idols? What is this, but to wish that God would depose himself from being our governor, and leave us
to our own conduct? or else to wish that he were as unholy as ourselves, as careless of his own laws as we
are; that is, that he were no more a God than we, a God as sinful and unrighteous as ourselves? He whose
heart riseth against the law of God to unlaw it, riseth against the Author of that law to undeify him. He
that casts contempt upon the dearest thing God hath in the world, that which is the image of his holiness,
the delight of his soul; that which he hath given a special charge to maintain, and that because it is holy,
just, and good, would not stick to rejoice at the destruction of God himself. If God’s holiness and
righteousness in the beam be despised, much more will an immense goodness and holiness in the fountain
be rejected: he that wisheth a beam far from his eyes, because it offends and scorcheth him, can be no
friend to the sun, from whence that beam doth issue. How unworthy a creature is man, since he only, a
rational creature, is the sole being that withdraws itself from the rule of God in this earth! And how
miserable a creature is he also, since, departing from the order of God’s goodness, he falls into the order
of his justice; and while he refuseth God to be the rule of his life, he cannot avoid him being the Judge of
his punishment! It is this is the original of all sin, and the fountain of all our misery. This is the first thing
man disowns, the rule which God sets him.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, Man naturally owns any other rule rather than that of God’s prescribing. The law of God
orders one thing, the heart of man desires another. There is not the basest thing in the world, but man
would sooner submit to be guided by it, rather than by the holiness of God; and when anything that God
commands crosses our own wills, we value it no more than we would the advice of a poor dispicable
beggar. How many are “lovers of pleasure, more than overs of God!”194 To make something which
contributes to the perfection of nature, as learning, wisdom, moral virtues, our rule, would be more
tolerable; but to pay that homage to a swinish pleasure, which is the right of God, is an inexcusable
contempt of him. The greatest excellency in the world is infinitely below God; much more a bestial
delight, which is both disgraceful and below the nature of man. If we made the vilest creature on earth our
idol, it is more excusable than to be the slave of a brutish pleasure. The viler the thing is that doth possess
the throne in our heart, the greater contempt it is of him who can only claim a right to it, and is worthy of
it. Sin is the first object of man’s election, as soon as the faculty whereby he chooses comes to exercise its
power; and it is so dear to man, that it is, in the estimate of our Saviour, counted as the right hand, and the
right eye, dear, precious, and useful members.
</p>
<p>
     1. The rule of Satan is owned before the rule of God. The natural man would rather be under the
guidance of Satan than the yoke of his Creator. Adam chose him to be his governor in Paradise. No
sooner had Satan spoke of God in a way of derision (Gen. 3:1, 5), “Yea, hath God said,” but man follows
his counsel and approves of the scoff; and the greatest part of his posterity have not been wiser by his fall,
but would rather ramble in the devil’s wilderness, than to stay in God’s fold. It is by the sin of man that
the devil is become the god of the world, as if men were the electors of him to the government; sin is an
election of him for a lord, and a putting the soul under his government. Those that live according to the
course of the world, and are loth to displease it, are under the government of the prince of it. The greatest
part of the works done in the world is to enlarge the kingdom of Satan. For how many ages were the laws
whereby the greatest part of the world was governed in the affairs of religion, the fruits of his usurpation
and policy? When temples were erected to him, priests consecrated to his service; the rites used in most of
the worship of the world were either of his own coining, or the misapplying the rites God had ordained to
himself, under the notion of a God: whence the apostle calls all idolatrous feasts the table of devils, the
cup of devils, sacrifice to devils, fellowship with devils;195 devils being the real object of the pagan
worship, though not formally intended by the worshipper; though in some parts of the Indies, the direct
and peculiar worship is to the devil, that he might not hurt them. And though the intention of others was
to offer to God, and not the devil, yet since the action was contrary to the will of God, he regards it as a
sacrifice to devils. It was not the intention of Jeroboam to establish priests to the devil, when he
consecrated them to the service of his calves, for Jehu afterwards calls them “the servants of the Lord” (2
Kings 10:23), “See if there be here none of the servants of the Lord,” to distinguish them from the
servants of Baal; signifying that the true God was worshipped under those images, and not Baal, nor any
of the gods of the heathens; yet the Scripture couples the calves and devils together, and ascribes the
worship given to one to be given to the other: “He ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
devils, and for the calves which he had made;”196 so that they were sacrifices to devils, notwithstanding
the intention of Jeroboam and his subjects that had set them up and worshipped them, because they were
contrary to the mind of God, and agreeable to the doctrine and mind of Satan, though the object of their
worship in their own intention were not the devil, but some deified man or some canonized saint. The
intention makes not a good action; if so, when men kill the best servants of God with a design to do God
service, as our Saviour foretells,197 the action would not be murder; yet who can call it otherwise, since
God is wronged in the persons of his servants? Since most of the worship of the world, which men’s
corrupt natures incline them to, is false and different from the revealed will of God, it is a practical
acknowledgment of the devil, as the governor, by acknowledging and practising those doctrines, which
have not the stamp of divine revelation upon them, but were minted by Satan to depress the honor of God
in the world. It doth concern men, then, to take good heed, that in their acts of worship they have a divine
rule; otherwise it is an owning the devil as the rule: for there is no medium; whatsoever is not from God,
is from Satan. But to bring this closer to us, and consider that which is more common among us: men that
are in a natural condition, and wedded to their lusts, are under the paternal government of Satan (John
8:44): “Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.” If we divide sin into
spiritual and carnal, which division comprehends all, the devil’s authority is owned in both; in spiritual,
we conform to his example, because those he commits; in carnal, we obey his will, because those he
directs: he acts the one, and sets us a copy; he tempts to the other, and gives us a kind of a precept. Thus
man by nature being a willing servant of sin, is more desirous to be bound in the devil’s iron chain, than
in God’s silken cords. What greater atheism can there be, than to use God as if he were inferior to the
devil? to take the part of his greatest enemy, who drew all others into the faction against him? to pleasure
Satan by offending God, and gratify our adversary with the injury of our Creator? For a subject to take
arms against his prince with the deadliest enemy both himself and prince hath in the whole world, adds a
greater blackness to the rebellion.
</p>
<p>
     2. The more visible rule preferred before God in the world, is man. The opinion of the world is more
our rule than the precept of God; and many men’s abstinence from sin is not from a sense of the Divine
will, no, nor from a principle of reason, but from an affection to some man on whom they depend, or fear
of punishment from a superior; the same principle with that in a ravenous beast, who abstains from what
he desires, for fear only of a stick or club. Men will walk with the herds, go in fashion with the most,
speak and act as the most do. While we conform to the world, we cannot perform a reasonable service to
God, nor prove, nor approve practically what the good and acceptable will of God is; the apostle puts
them in opposition to one another.198 This appears,
</p>
<p>
     1. In complying more with the dictates of men, than the will of God. Men draw encouragement from
God’s forbearance to sin more freely against him; but the fear of punishment for breaking the will of man
lays a restraint upon them. The fear of man is a more powerful curb, to restrain men in their duty, than the
fear of God; so we may please a friend, a master, a governor, we are regardless whether we please God or
no; men-pleasers are more than God-pleasers; man is more advanced as a rule, than God, when we submit
to human orders, and stagger and dispute against divine. Would not a prince think himself slighted in his
authority, if any of his servants should decline his commands, by the order of one of his subjects? And
will not God make the same account of us, when we deny or delay our obedience, for fear of one of his
creatures? In the fear of man, we as little acknowledge God for our sovereign, as we do for our comforter
(Isa. 51:12, 13): “I, even I, am he that comforteth you; who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man
that shall die,” &amp;c. “and forgettest the Lord thy maker?” &amp;c. We put a slight upon God, as if he were not
able to bear us out in our duty to him, and incapable to balance the strength of an arm of flesh.
</p>
<p>
     2. In observing that which is materially the will of God, not because it is his will, but the injunctions
of men. As the word of God may be received, yet not as his word, so the will of God may be performed,
yet not as his will; it is materially done, but not formally obeyed. An action, and obedience in that action,
are two things; as when man commands the ceasing from all works of the ordinary calling on the Sabhath,
it is the same that God enjoins: the cessation, or attendance of his servants on the hearing of the word, are
conformable in the matter of it to the will of God; but it is only conformable in the obediential part of the
acts to the will of man, when it is done only with respect to a human precept. As God hath a right to enact
his laws without consulting his creature in the way of his government, so man is bound to obey those
laws, without consulting whether they be agreeable to men’s laws or no. If we act the will of God because
the will of our superiors concurs with it, we obey not God in that, but man, a human will being the rule of
our obedience, and not the divine; this is to vilify God, and make him inferior to man in our esteem, and a
valuing the rule of man above that of our Creator. Since God is the highest perfection and infinitely good,
whatsoever rule he gives the creature must be good, else it cannot proceed from God. A base thing cannot
be the product of an infinite excellency, and an unreasonable thing cannot be the product of an infinite
wisdom and goodness; therefore, as the respecting God’s will before the will of man is excellent and
worthy of a creature, and is an acknowledging the excellency, goodness, and wisdom of God, so the eying
the will of man before and above the will of God, is on the contrary, a denial of all those in a lump, and a
preferring the wisdom, goodness, and power of man in his law, above all those perfections of God in his.
Whatsoever men do that looks like moral virtue or abstinence from vices, not out of obedience to the rule
God hath set, but because of custom, necessity, example, or imitation, they may, in the doing of it, be
rather said to be apes than Christians.
</p>
<p>
     3. In obeying the will of man when it is contrary to the will of God; as the Israelites willingly “walked
after the commandment,”199 not of God, but of Jeroboam in the case of the calves, and “made the king’s
heart glad with their lies.”200 They cheered him with their ready obedience to his command for idolatry
(which was a lie in itself, and a lie in them) against the commandment of God, and the warnings of the
prophets, rather than cheer the heart of God with their obedience to his worship instituted by him; nay,
and when God offered them to cure them their wound, their iniquity breaks out afresh; they would neither
have him as a lord to rule them, nor a physician to cure them (Hosea 7:1): “When I would have healed
Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered.” The whole Persian nation shrunk at once from a duty
due by the light of nature to the Deity, upon a decree that “neither God or man should be petitioned to for
thirty days, but only their king;”201 one only, Daniel, excepted against it, who preferred his homage to
God, above obedience to his prince. An adulterous generation is many times made the rule of men’s
professions, as is implied in those words of our Saviour (Mark 8:38): “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me
and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation:” own him among his disciples, and be ashamed of
him among his enemies. Thus men are said to deny God (Tit. 1:16), when they “attend to Jewish fables
and the precepts of men rather than the word of God;” when the decrees or canons of fallible men are
valued at a higher rate, and preferred before the writings of the Holy Ghost by his apostles. As man
naturally disowns the rule God sets him, and owns any other rule than that of God’s prescribing, so,
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, He doth this in order to the setting himself up as his own rule; as though our own wills, and
not God’s, were the true square and measure of goodness. We make an idol of our own wills, and as much
as self is exalted, God is deposed; the more we esteem our own wills, the more we endeavor to annihilate
the will of God; account nothing of him, the more we account of ourselves, and endeavor to render
ourselves his superiors, by exalting our own wills. No prince but would look upon his authority as
invaded, his royalty derided, if a subject should resolve to be a law to himself, in opposition to his known
will; true piety is to hate ourselves, deny ourselves, and cleave solely to the service of God. To make
ourselves our own rule, and the object of our chiefest love, is atheism. If self-denial be the greatest part of
godliness, the great letter in the alphabet of religion; self-love is the great letter in the alphabet of practical
atheism. Self is the great antichrist and anti-God in the world, that sets up itself above all that is called
God; self-love is the captain of that black band (2 Tim. 3:2): it sits in the temple of God, and would be
adored as God. Self-love begins; but denying the power of godliness, which is the same with denying the
ruling power of God, ends the list. It is so far from bending to the righteous will of the Creator, that it
would have the eternal will of God stoop to the humor and unrighteous will of a creature; and this is the
ground of the contention between the flesh and spirit in the heart of a renewed man; flesh wars for the
godhead of self, and spirit fights for the godhead of God; the one would settle the throne of the Creator,
and the other maintain a law of covetousness, ambition, envy, lust, in the stead of God. The evidence of
this will appear in these propositions:
</p>
<p>
    1. This is natural to man as he is corrupted. What was the venom of the sin of Adam, is naturally
derived with his nature to all his posterity. It was not the eating a forbidden apple, or the pleasing his
palate that Adam aimed at, or was the chief object of his desire, but to live independently on his Creator,
and be a God to himself (Gen. 3:5): “You shall be as gods.” That which was the matter of the devil’s
temptation, was the incentive of man’s rebellion; a likeness to God he aspired to in the judgment of God
himself, an infallible interpreter of man’s thoughts; “Behold, man is become as one of us, to know good
and evil,” in regard of self-sufficiency and being a rule to himself. The Jews understand the ambition of
man to reach no further than an equality with the angelical nature; but Jehovah here understands it in
another sense; God had ordered man by this prohibition not to eat of the fruit of the “tree of knowledge of
good and evil;” not to attempt the knowledge of good and evil of himself, but to wait upon the dictates of
God; not to trust to his own counsels, but to depend wholly upon him for direction and guidance.
Certainly he that would not hold off his hand from so small a thing as an apple, when he had his choice of
the fruit of the garden, would not have denied himself anything his appetite had desired, when that
principle had prevailed upon him; he would not have stuck at a greater matter to pleasure himself with the
displeasing of God, when for so small a thing he would incur the anger of his Creator. Thus would he
deify his own understanding against the wisdom of God, and his own appetite against the will of God.
This desire of equality with God, a learned man202 thinks the apostle intimates (Phil. 2:6): “Who being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;” the Son’s being in the form of God, and
thinking it no robbery to be equal with God, implies that the robbery of sacrilege committed by our first
parents, for which the Son of God humbled himself to the death of the cross, was an attempt to be equal
with God, and depend no more upon God’s directions, but his own conduct; which could be no less than
an invasion of the throne of God, and endeavor to put himself into a posture to be his mate. Other sins,
adultery, theft, &amp;c. could not be committed by him at that time, but he immediately puts forth his hand to
usurp the power of his Maker; this treason is the old Adam in every man. The first Adam contradicted the
will of God to set up himself; the second Adam humbled himself, and did nothing but by the command
and will of his Father. This principle wherein the venom of the old Adam lies, must be crucified to make
way for the throne of the humble and obedient principle of the new Adam, or quickening Spirit; indeed
sin in its own nature is nothing else but “a willing according to self, and contrary to the will of God;” lusts
are therefore called the wills of the flesh and of the mind.203 As the precepts of God are God’s will, so the
violation of these precepts is man’s will; and thus man usurps a godhead to himself, by giving that honor
to his own will which belongs to God, appropriating the right of rule to himself, and denying it to his
Creator. That servant that acts according to his own will, with a neglect of his master’s, refuseth the duty
of a servant, and invades the right of his master. This self-love and desire of independency on God has
been the root of all sin in the world. The great controversy between God and man hath been, whether he
or they shall be God; whether his reason or theirs, his will or theirs, shall be the guiding principle. As
grace is the union of the will of God and the will of the creature, so sin is the opposition of the will of self
to the will of God; “Leaning to our own understanding,” is opposed as a natural evil to “trusting in the
Lord,”204 a supernatural grace. Men commonly love what is their own, their own inventions, their own
fancies; therefore the ways of a wicked man are called the “ways of his own heart,”205 and the ways of a
superstitious man his own devices (Jer. 18:11): “We will walk after our own devices;” we will be a law to
ourselves; and what the Psalmist saith of the tongue, Our tongues are our own, who shall control us? is as
truly the language of men’s hearts, Our wills are our own, who shall check us?
</p>
<p>
     2. This is evident in the dissatisfaction of men with their own consciences when they contradict the
desires of self. Conscience is nothing but an actuated or reflex knowledge of a superior power and an
equitable law; a law impressed, and a power above it impressing it. Conscience is not the lawgiver, but
the remembrancer to mind us of that law of nature imprinted upon our souls, and actuate the
considerations of the duty and penalty, to apply the rule to our acts, and pass judgment upon matter of
fact: it is to give the charge, urge the rule, enjoin the practice of those notions of right, as part of our duty
and obedience. But man is as much displeased with the directions of conscience, as he is out of love with
the accusations and condemning sentence of this officer of God: we cannot naturally endure any quick
and lively practical thoughts of God and his will, and distaste our own consciences for putting us in mind
of it: they therefore “like not to retain God in their knowledge,”206 that is, God in their own consciences;
they would blow it out, as it is the candle of the Lord in them to direct them, and their acknowledgments
of God, to secure themselves against the practice of its principles: they would stop all the avenues to any
beam of light, and would not suffer a sparkle of divine knowledge to flutter in their minds, in order to set
up another directing rule suited to the fleshly appetite: and when they cannot atop the light of it from
glaring in their faces, they rebel against it, and cannot endure to abide in its paths.207 He speaks not of
those which had the written word, or special revelations; but only a natural light or traditional, handed
from Adam: hence are all the endeavors to still it when it begins to speak, by some carnal pleasures, as
Saul’s evil spirit with a fit of music; or bribe it with some fits of a glavering devotion, when it holds the
law of God in its commanding authority before the mind: they would we out all the impressions of it
when it presses the advancement of God above self, and entertain it with no better compliment than Ahab
did Elijah, “Hast thou found me, O my enemy?” If we are like to God in anything of our natural fabric, it
is in the auperior and more spiritual part of our souls. The resistance of that which is most like to God,
and instead of God in us, is a disowning of the Sovereign represented by that officer. He that would be
without conscience, would be without God, whose vicegerent it is, and make the sensitive part, which
conscience opposes, his lawgiver. Thus a man, out of respect to sinful self, quarrels with his natural self,
and cannot comport himself in a friendly behavior to his internal implanted principles: he hates to come
under the rebukes of them, as much as Adam hated to come into the presence of God, after he turned
traitor against him: the bad entertainment God’s deputy hath in us, reflects upon that God whose cause it
pleads: it is upon no other account that men loathe the upright language of their own reasons in those
matters, and wish the eternal silence of their own consciences, but as they maintain the rights of God, and
would hinder the idol of self from usurping his godhead and prerogative. Though this power be part of a
man’s self, rooted in his nature, as essential to him and inseparable from him as the best part of his being;
yet he quarrels with it, as it is God’s deputy, and stickling for the honor of God in his soul, and quarrelling
with that sinful self he would cherish above God. We are not displeased with this faculty barely as it
exerciseth a self-reflection; but as it is God’s vicegerent, and bears the mark of his authority in it. In some
cases this self-reflecting act meets with good entertainment, when it acts not in contradiction to self, but
suitable to natural affections. As suppose a man hath in his passion struck his child, and caused thereby
some great mischief to him, the reflection of conscience will not be unwelcome to him; will work some
tenderness in him, because it takes the part of self and of natural affection; but in the more spiritual
concerns of God it will be rated as a busy-body.
</p>
<p>
     3. Many, if not most actions, materially good in the world, are done more because they are agreeable
to self, than as they are honorable to God. As the word of God may be heard not as his word,208 but as
there may be pleasing notions in it, or discourses against an opinion or party we disaffect; so the will of
God may be performed, not as his will, but as it may gratify some selfish consideration, when we will
please God so far as it may not displease ourselves, and serve him as our Master, so far as his command
may be a servant to our humor; when we consider not who it is that commands, but how short it comes of
displeasing that sin which rules in our heart, pick and choose what is least burdensome to the flesh, and
distasteful to our lusts. He that doth the will of God, not out of conscience of that will, but because it is
agreeable to himself, casts down the will of God, and sets his own will in the place of it; takes the crown
from the head of God, and places it upon the head of self. If things are done, not because they are
commanded by God, but desirable to us, it is a disobedient obedience; a conformity to God’s will in
regard of the matter, a conformity to our own will in regard of the motive; either as the things done are
agreeable to natural and moral self, or sinful self.
</p>
<p>
     (1). As they are agreeable to natural or moral self. When men will practise some points of religion,
and walk in the track of some divine precepts; not because they are divine, but because they are agreeable
to their humor or constitution of nature; from the sway of a natural bravery, the bias of a secular interest,
not from an ingenuous sense of God’s authority, or a voluntary submission to his will; as when a man will
avoid excess in drinking, not because it is dishonorable to God, but as it is a blemish to his own
reputation, or an impair of the health of his body: doth this deserve the name of an observance of the
divine injunction, or rather an obedience to ourselves? Or when a man will be liberal in the distribution of
his charity, not with an eye to God’s precept, but in compliance with his own natural compassion, or to
pleasure the generosity of his nature: the one is obedience to a man’s own preservation; the other an
obedience to the interest or impulse of a moral virtue. It is not respect to the rule of God, but the authority
of self, and, at the best, is but the performance of the material part of the divine rule, without any
concurrence of a spiritual motive or a spiritual manner. That only is a maintaining the rights of God, when
we pay an observance to his rule, without examining the agreeableness of it to our secular interest, or
consulting with the humor of flesh and blood; when we will not decline his service, though we find it
cross, and hath no affinity with the pleasure of our own nature: such an obedience as Abraham manifested
in his readiness to sacrifice his son; such an obedience as our Saviour demands in cutting off the right
hand. When we observe anything of divine order upon the account of its suitableness to our natural
sentiments, we shall readily divide from him, when the interest of nature turns its point against the interest
of God’s honor; we shall fall off from him according to the change we find in our own humors. And can
that be valued as a setting up the rule of God, which must be deposed upon the mutable interest of an
inconstant mind? Esau had no regard to God in delaying the execution of his resolution to shorten his
brother’s days, though he was awed by the reverence of his father to delay it; he considered, perhaps, how
justly he might lie under the imputation of hastening crazy Isaac’s death, by depriving him of a beloved
son. But had the old man’s head been laid, neither the contrary command of God, nor the nearness of a
fraternal relation, could have bound his hands from the act, no more than they did his heart from the
resolution (Gen. 27:41): “Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him; and
Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I slay my brother.” So
many children, that expect at the death of their parents great inheritances of portions, may be observant of
them, not in regard of the rule fixed by God, but to their own hopes, which they would not frustrate by a
disobligement. Whence is it that many men abstain from gross sins, but in love to their reputation?
Wickedness may be acted privately, which a man’s own credit puts a bar to the open commission of. The
preserving his own esteem may divert him from entering into a brothel house, to which he hath set his
mind before, against a known precept of his Creator. As Pharaoh parted with the Israelites, so do some
men with their blemishing sins; not out of a sense of God’s rule, but the smart of present judgments, or
fear of a future wrath. Our security then, and reputation, is set up in the place of God. This also may be,
and is in renewed men, who have the law written in their hearts, that is, an habitual disposition to an
agreement with the law of God; when what is done is with a respect to this habitual inclination, without
eying the divine precept, which is appointed to be their rule. This also is to set up a creature, as renewed
self is, instead of the Creator, and that law of his in his word, which ought to be the rule of our actions.
Thus it is when men choose a moral life, not so much out of respect to the law of nature, as it is the law of
God, but as it is a law become one with their souls and constitutions. There is more of self in this than
consideration of God; for if it were the latter, the revealed law of God would, upon the same reason, be
received as well as his natural law. From this principle of self, morality comes by some to be advanced
above evangelical dictates.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) As they are agreeable to sinful self. Not that the commands of God are suited to bolster up the
corruptions of men, no more than the law can be said to excite or revive sin:209 but it is like a scandal
taken, not given; an occasion taken by the tumultuousness of our depraved nature. The Pharisees were
devout in long prayers, not from a sense of duty, or a care of God’s honor; but to satisfy their ambition,
and rake together fuel for their covetousness,210 that they might have the greater esteem and richer
offerings, to free by their prayers the souls of deceased persons from purgatory; an opinion that some
think the Jewish synagogue had then entertained,211 since some of their doctors have defended such a
notion. Men may observe some precepts of God to have a better conveniency to break others. Jehu was
ordered to cut off the house of Ahab. The service he undertook was in itself acceptable, but corrupt nature
misacted that which holiness and righteousness commanded. God appointed it to magnify his justice, and
check the idolatry that had been supported by that family; Jehu acted it to satisfy his revenge and
ambition: he did it to fulfil his lust, not the will of God who enjoined him: Jehu applauds it as zeal; and
God abhors it as murder, and therefore would avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu (Hos. 1:4).
Such kind of services are not paid to God for his own sake, but to ourselves for our lusts’ sake.
</p>
<p>
    4. This is evident in neglecting to take God’s direction upon emergent occasions. This follows the
text, “None did seek God.” When we consult not with him, but trust more to our own will and counsel, we
make ourselves our own governors and lords independent upon him; as though we could be our own
counsellors, and manage our concerns without his leave and assistance; as though our works were in our
own hands, and not in the “hands of God.”212 that we can by our own strength and sagacity direct them to
a successful end without him. If we must “acquaint ourselves with God” before we decree a thing,213 then
to decree a thing without acquainting God with it, is to prefer our purblind wisdom before the infinite
wisdom of God: to resolve without consulting God, is to depose God and deify self, our own wit and
strength. We would rather, like Lot, follow our own humor and stay in Sodom, than observe the angel’s
order to go out of it.
</p>
<p>
    6. As we account the actions of others to be good or evil, as they suit with, or spurn against our
fancies and humors. Virtue is a crime, and vice a virtue, as it is contrary or concurrent with our humors.
Little reason have many men to blame the actions of others, but because they are not agreeable to what
they affect and desire; we would have all men take directions from us, and move according to our beck,
hence that common speech in the world, Such an one is an honest friend. Why? because he is of their
humor, and lackeys according to their wills. Thus we make self the measure and square of good and evil
in the rest of mankind, and judge of it by our own fancies, and not by the will of God, the proper rule of
judgment. Well then, let us consider: Is not this very common? are we not naturally more willing to
displease God than displease ourselves, when it comes to a point that we must do one or other? Is not our
own counsel of more value with us, than conformity to the will of the Creator? Do not our judgments
often run counter to the judgment of God? Have his laws a greater respect from us, than our own humors?
Do we scruple the staining his honor when it comes in competition with our own? Are not the lives of
most men a pleasing themselves, without a repentance that ever they displeased God? Is not this to
undeify God, to deify ourselves, and disown the propriety he hath in us by the right of creation and
beneficence? We order our own ways by our own humors, as though we were the authors of our own
being, and had given ourselves life and understanding. This is to destroy the order that God hath placed
between our wills and his own, and a lifting up of the foot above the head; it is the deformity of the
creature. The honor of every rational creature consists in the service of the First Cause of his being; as the
welfare of every creature consists in the orders and proportionable motion of its members, according to
the law of its creation. He that moves and acts according to a law of his own, offers a manifest wrong to
God, the highest wisdom and chiefest good; disturbs the order of the world; nulls the design of the
righteousness and holiness of God. The law of God is the rule of that order he would have observed in the
world; he that makes another law his rule, thrusts out the order of the Creator, and establishes the disorder
of the creature. But this will yet be more evident, in the fourth thing.
</p>
<p>
    Fourthly, Man would make himself the rule of God, and give laws to his Creator. We are willing God
should be our benefactor, but not our ruler; we are content to admire his excellency and pay him a
worship, provided he will walk by our rule. “This commits a riot upon his nature, To think him to be what
we ourselves “would have him, and wish him to be” (Psalm 50:21), we would amplify his mercy and
contract his justice; we would have his power enlarged to supply our wants, and straitened when it goes
about to revenge our crimes; we would have him wise to defeat our enemies, but not to disappoint our
unworthy projects; we would have him all eye to regard our indigence, and blind not to discern our guilt;
we would have him true to his promises, regardless of his precepts, and false to his threatenings; we
would new mint the nature of God according to our models, and shape a God according to our own
fancies, as he made us at first according to his own image;” instead of obeying him, we would have him
obey us; instead of owning and admiring his perfections, we would have him strip himself of his infinite
excellency, and clothe himself with a nature agreeable to our own. This is not only to set up self as the
law of God, but to make our own imaginations the model of the nature of God.214 Corrupted man takes a
pleasure to accuse or suspect the actions of God: we would not have him act conveniently to his nature;
but act what doth gratify us, and abstain from what distastes us. Man is never well but when he is
impeaching one or other perfection of God’s nature, and undermining his glory, as if all his attributes
must stand indicted at the bar of our purblind reason: this weed shoots up in the exercise of grace. Peter
intended the refusal of our Saviour s washing his feet, as an act of humility, but Christ understands it to be
a prescribing a law to himself, a correcting his love (John 13:8, 9). This is evidenced,
</p>
<p>
    1. In the strivings against his law. How many men imply by their lives, that they would have God
deposed from his government, and some unrighteous being step into his throne; as if God had or should
change his laws of holiness into laws of licentiousness: as if he should abrogate his old eternal precepts,
and enact contrary ones in their stead? What is the language of such practices, but that they would be
God’s lawgivers and not his subjects? that he should deal with them according to their own wills, and not
according to his righteousness? that they could make a more holy, wise, and righteous law than the law of
God? that their imaginations, and not God’s righteousness, should be the rule of his doing good to them?
(Jer. 9:31): “They have forsaken my law, and walked after the imaginations of their own heart.” When an
act is known to be a sin, and the law that forbids it acknowledged to be the law of God, and after this we
persist in that which is contrary to it, we tax his wisdom as if he did not understand what was convenient
for us; “we would teach God knowledge;”215 it is an implicit wish that God had laid aside the holiness of
his nature, and framed a law to pleasure our lusts. When God calls for weeping and mourning, and girding
with sackcloth upon approaching judgments, then the corrupt heart is for joy and gladness, eating of flesh
and drinking of wine, because to-morrow they should die;216 as if God had mistaken himself when he
ordered them so much sorrow, when their lives were so near an end; and had lost his understanding when
he ordered such a precept: disobedience is therefore called contention (Rom. 2:8): “Contentious, and obey
not the truth:” contention against God, whose truth it is that they disobey; a dispute with him, which hath
more of wisdom in itself, and conveniency for them, his truth of their imaginations. The more the love,
goodness, and holiness of God appears in any command, the more are we naturally averse from it, and
cast an imputation on him, as if he were foolish, unjust, cruel, and that we could have advised and
directed him better. The goodness of God is eminent to us in appointing a day for his own worship,
wherein we might converse with him, and he with us, and our souls be refreshed with spiritual
communications from him; and we rather use it for the ease of our bodies, than the advancement of our
souls, as if God were mistaken and injured his creature, when he urged the spiritual part of duty. Every
disobedience to the law is an implicit giving law to him, and a charge against him that he might have
provided better for his creature.
</p>
<p>
    2. In disapproving the methods of God’s government of the world. If the counsels of Heaven roll not
about according to their schemes, instead of adoring the unsearchable depths of his judgments, they call
him to the bar, and accuse him, because they are not fitted to their narrow vessels, as if a nut-shell could
contain an ocean. As corrupt reason esteems the highest truths foolishness, so it counts the most righteous
ways unequal. Thus we commence a suit against God., as though he had not acted righteously and wisely,
but must give an account of his proceedings at our tribunal. This is to make ourselves God’s superiors,
and resume to instruct him better in the government of the world; as tough God hindered himself and the
world, in not making us of his privy council, and not ordering his affairs according to the contrivances of
our dim understandings. Is not this manifest in our immoderate complaints of God’s dealings with his
church, as though there were a coldness in God’s affections to his church, and a glowing heat towards it
only in us? Hence are those importunate desires for things which are not established by any promise, as
though we would overrule and over persuade God to comply with our humor. We have an ambition to be
God’s tutors and direct him in his counsels: “Who hath been his counsellor?” saith the apostle.217 Who
ought not to be his counsellor? saith corrupt nature. Men will find fault with God in what he suffers to be
done according to their own minds, when they feel the bitter fruit of it. When Cain had killed his brother,
and his conscience racked him, how saucily and discontentedly doth he answer God! (Gen. 4:9), “Am I
my brother’s keeper?” Since thou dost own thyself the rector of the world, thou shouldst have preserved
his person from my fury; since thou dost accept his sacrifice before my offering, preservation was due as
well as acceptance. If this temper be found on earth, no wonder it is lodged in hell. That deplorable person
under the sensible stroke of God’s sovereign justice, would oppose his nay to God’s will (Luke 16:30):
“And he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead they will repent.” He would
presume to prescribe more effectual means than Moses and the prophets, to inform men of the danger they
incurred by their sensuality. David was displeased, it is said (2 Sam. 6:8), when the Lord had made a
breach upon Uzzah, not with Uzzah, who was the object of his pity, but with God, who was the inflicter
of that punishment. When any of our friends have been struck with a rod, against our sentiments and
wishes, have not our hearts been apt to swell in complaints against God, as though he disregarded the
goodness of such a person, did not see with our eyes, and measure him by our esteem of him? as if he
should have asked our counsel, before he had resolved, and managed himself according, to our will, rather
than his own. If he be patient to the wicked, we are apt to tax his holiness, and accuse him as an enemy to
his own law. If he inflict severity upon the righteous, we are ready to suspect his goodness, and charge
him to be an enemy to his affectionate creature. If he spare the Nimrods of the world, we are ready to ask,
“Where is the God of judgment?”218 If he afflict the pillars of the earth, we are ready to question, where is
the God of mercy? It is impossible, since the depraved nature of man, and the various interests and
passions in the world, that infinite power and wisdom can act righteously for the good of the universe, but
he will shake some corrupt interest or other upon the earth; so various are the inclinations of men, and
such a weather-cock judgment hath every man in himself, that the divine method he applauds this day,
upon a change of his interest, he will cavil at the next. It is impossible for the just orders of God to please
the same person many weeks, scarce many minutes together. God must cease to be God, or to be holy, if
he should manage the concerns of the world according to the fancies of men. How unreasonable is it thus
to impose laws upon God! Must God revoke his own orders? govern according to the dictates of his
creature? Must God, who hath only power and wisdom to sway the sceptre, become the obedient subject
of every man’s humor, and manage everything to serve the design of a simple creature? This is not to be
God, but to set the creature in his throne: though this be not formally done, yet that it is interpretatively
and practically done, is every hour’s experience.
</p>
<p>
     3. In impatience in our particular concerns. It is ordinary with man to charge God in his complaints in
the time of affliction. Therefore it is the commendation the Holy Ghost gives to Job (ch. 1:22), that in all
this, that is, in those many waves that rolled over him, he did not charge God foolishly, he never spake
nor thought anything unworthy of the majesty and righteousness of God; yet afterwards we find him
warping; he nicknames the affliction to be God’s oppression of him, and no act of his goodness (10:3): “Is
it good for thee, that thou shouldst oppress?” He seems to charge God with injustice, for punishing him
when he was not wicked, for which he appeals to God: “Thou knowest that I am not wicked” (ver. 7), and
that God acted not like a Creator (ver. 8). If our projects are disappointed, what fretfulness against God’s
management are our hearts racked with! How do uncomely passions bubble upon us, interpretatively at
least wishing that the arms of his power had been bound, and the eye of his omniscience been
hoodwinked, that we might have been left to our own liberty and designs? and this oftentimes when we
have more reason to bless him than repine at him. The Israelites murmured more against God in the
wilderness, with manna in their mouths, than they did at Pharaoh in the brick-kilns, with their garlic and
onions between their teeth. Though we repine at instruments in our afflictions, yet God counts it a
reflection upon himself. The Israelites speaking against Moses, was, in God’s interpretation, a rebellion
against himself:219 and rebellion is always a desire of imposing laws and conditions upon those against
whom the rebellion is raised. The sottish dealings of the vine-dressers in Franconia with the statue of St.
Urban, the protector of the vines, upon his own day, is an emblem of our dealing with God: if it be a clear
day and portend a prosperous vintage, they honor the statue and drink healths to it; if it be a rainy day, and
presage a scantiness, they daub it with dirt in indignation. We cast out our mire and dirt against God when
he acts cross to our wishes, and flatter him when the wind of his providence joins itself to the tide of our
interest. Men set a high price upon themselves, and are angry God values them not at the same rate, as if
their judgment concerning themselves were more piercing than his. This is to disannul God’s judgment,
and condemn him and count ourselves righteous, as ’tis Job 40:8. This is the epidemical disease of human
nature; they think they deserve caresses instead of rods, and upon crosses are more ready to tear out the
heart of God, than reflect humbly upon their own hearts. When we accuse God, we applaud ourselves, and
make ourselves his superiors, intimating that we have acted more righteously to him than he to us, which
is the highest manner of imposing laws apon him; as that emperor accused the justice of God for
snatching him out of the world too soon.220 What a high piece of practical atheism is this, to desire that
infinite wisdom should be guided by our folly, and asperse the righteousness of God rather than blemish
our own! Instead of silently submitting to his will and adoring his wisdom, we declaim against him, as an
unwise and unjust governor: we would invert his order, make him the steward and ourselves the
proprietors of what we are and have: we deny ourselves to be sinners, and our mercies to be forfeited.
</p>
<p>
    4. It is evidenced in envying the gifts and prosperities of others. Envy hath a deep tincture of practical
atheism, and is a cause of atheism.221 We are unwilling to leave God to be the proprietor and do what he
will with his own, and as a Creator to do what he pleases with his creatures. We assume a liberty to direct
God what portions, when and how, he should bestow upon his creatures. We would not let him choose his
own favorites, and pitch upon his own instruments for his glory; as if God should have asked counsel of
us how he should dispose of his benefits. We are unwilling to leave to his wisdom the management of his
own judgments to the wicked, and the dispensation of his own love to ourselves. This temper is natural: it
is as ancient as the first age of the world. Adam envied God a felicity by himself, and would not spare a
tree that he had reserved as a mark of his sovereignty. The passion that God had given Cain to employ
against his sin, he turns against his Creator. He was wroth with God and with Abel;222 but envy was at the
root, because his brother’s sacrifice was accepted and his refused. How could he envy his accepted
person, without reflecting upon the Acceptor of his offering? Good men have not been free from it. Job
questions the goodness of God, that he should shine upon the counsel of the wicked (Job 10:3). Jonah had
too much of self, in fearing to be counted a false prophet, when he came with absolute denunciations of
wrath;223 and when he could not bring a volley of destroying judgments upon the Ninevites, he would
shoot his fury against his Master, envying those poor people the benefit, and God the honor of his mercy;
and this after he had been sent into the whale’s belly to learn humiliation, which, though he exercised
there, yet those two great branches of self-pride and envy were not lopped off from him in the belly of
hell; and God was fain to take pains with him, and by a gourd scarce makes him ashamed of his
peevishness. Envy is not like to cease till all atheism be cashiered, and that is in heaven. This sin is an
imitation of the devil, whose first sin upon earth was envy, as his first sin in heaven was pride. It is a
wishing that to ourselves, which the devil asserted as his right, to give the kingdoms of the world to whom
he pleased:224 it is an anger with God, because he hath not given us a patent for government. It utters the
same language in disparagement of God, as Absalom did in reflection on his father: If I were king in
Israel, justice should be better managed; if I were Lord of the world, there should be more wisdom to
discern the merits of men, and more righteousness in distributing to them their several portions. Thus we
impose laws upon God, and would have the righteousness of his will submit to the corruptions of ours,
and have him lower himself to gratify our minds, rather than fulfil his own. We charge the Author of
those gifts with injustice, that he hath not dealt equally; or with ignorance, that he hath mistook his mark.
In the same breath that we censure him by our peevishness, we would guide him by our wills. This is an
unreasonable part of atheism. If all were in the same state and condition, the order of the world would be
impaired. Is God bound to have a care of thee, and neglect all the world besides? “Shall the earth be
forsaken for thee?”225 Joseph had reason to be displeased with his brothers, if they had muttered because
he gave Benjamin a double portion, and the rest a single. It was unfit that they, who had deserved no gift
at all, should prescribe him rules how to dispense his own doles; much more unworthy it is to deal so with
God; yet this is too rife.
</p>
<p>
    5. It is evidenced in corrupt matter or ends of prayer and praise. When we are importunate for those
things that we know not whether the righteousness, holiness, and wisdom of God can grant, because he
hath not discovered his will in any promise to bestow them, we would then impose such conditions on
God, which he never obliged himself to grant; when we pray for things not so much to glorify God, which
ought to be the end of prayer, as to gratify ourselves. We acknowledge, indeed, by the act of petitioning,
that there is a God; but we would have him ungod himself to be at our beck, and debase himself to serve
our turns. When we desire those things which are repugnant to those attributes whereby he doth manage
the government of the world; when, by some superficial services, we think we have gained indulgence to
sins, which seems to be the thought of the strumpet, in her paying her vows, to wallow more freely in the
mire of her sensual pleasures—“I have peace-offerings with me; this day I have paid my vows, I have
made my peace with God, and have entertainment for thee;”226 or when men desire God to bless them in
the commission of some sin, as when Balak and Balaam offered sacrifices, that they might prosper in the
cursing of the Israelites (Num. 25:1, &amp;c.) So for a man to pray to God to save him, while he neglects the
means of salvation appointed by God, or to renew him when he slights the word, the only instrument to
that purpose; this is to impose laws upon God, contrary to the declared will and wisdom of God, and to
desire him to slight his own institutions. When we come into the presence of God with lusts reeking in our
hearts, and leap from sin to duty. we would impose the law of our corruption on the holiness of God.
While we pray “the will of God may be done,” self-love wishes its own will may be performed, as though
God should serve our humors, when we will not obey his precepts. And when we make vows under any
affliction, what is it often but a secret contrivance to bend and flatter him to our conditions? We will serve
him if he will restore us; we think thereby to compound the business with him, and bring him down to our
terms.
</p>
<p>
    6. It is evidenced in positive and bold interpretations of the judgments of God in the world. To
interpret the judgments of God to the disadvantage of the sufferer, unless it be an unusual judgment, and
have a remarkable hand of God in it, and the sin be rendered plainly legible in the affliction, is a.
presumption of this nature. When men will judge the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with the
sacrifices, greater sinners than others, and themselves righteous, because no drops of it were dashed upon
them; or when Shimei, being of the house of Saul, shall judge according to his own interest, and desires
David’s flight upon Absalom’s rebellion to be a punishment for invading the rights of Saul’s family, and
depriving him of the succession in the kingdom,227 as if he had been of God’s privy council, when he
decreed such acts of justice in the world. Thus we would fasten our own wills as a law or motive upon
God, and interpret his acts according to the motions of self. Is it not too ordinary, when God sends an
affliction upon those that bear ill-will to us, to judge it to be a righting of our cause, to be a fruit of God’s
concern for us in revenging our wrongs, as if we “had heard the secrets of God,” or, as Eliphaz saith, “had
turned over the records of heaven?” (Job 15:8.) This is a judgment according to self-love, not a divine
rule; and imposeth laws upon heaven, implying a secret wish that God would take care only of them,
make our concerns his own, not in ways of kindness and justice, but according to our fancies; and this is
common in the profane world, in those curses they so readily spit out upon any affront, as if God were
bound to draw his arrows and shoot them into the heart of all their offenders at their beck and pleasure.
</p>
<p>
    7. It is evidenced, in mixing rules for the worship of God with those which have been ordered by him.
Since men are most prone to live by sense, it is no wonder that a sensible worship, which affects their
outward sense with some kind of amazement, is dear to them, and spiritual worship most loathsome.
Pompous rites have been the great engine wherewith the devil hath deceived the souls of men, and
wrought them to a nauseating the simplicity of divine worship, as unworthy the majesty and excellency of
God.228 Thus the Jews would not understand the glory of the second temple in the presence of the
Messiah, because it had not the pompous grandeur of that of Solomon’s erecting. Hence in all ages men
have been forward to disfigure God’s models, and dress up a brat of their own; as though God had been
defective in providing for his own honor in his institutions, without the assistance of his creature. This
hath always been in the world; the old world had their imaginations, and the new world hath continued
them. The Israelites in the midst of miracles, and under the memory of a famous deliverance, would erect
a calf. The Pharisees, that sate in Moses’ chair, would coin new traditions, and enjoin them to be as
current as the law of God.229 Papists will be blending the christian appointments with pagan ceremonies,
to please the carnal fancies of the common people. “Altars have been multiplied” under the knowledge of
the law of God.230 Interest is made the balance of the conveniency of God’s injunctions. Jeroboam fitted a
worship to politic ends, and posted up calves to prevent his subjects revolting from his sceptre, which
might be occasioned by their resort to Jerusalem, and converse with the body of the people from whom
they were separated.231 Men will be putting in their own dictates with God’s laws, and are unwilling he
should be the sole Governor of the world without their counsel; they will not suffer him to be Lord of that
which is purely and solely his concern. How often hath the practice of the primitive church, the custom
wherein we are bred, the sentiments of our ancestors, been owned as a more authentic rule in matters of
worship, than the mind of God delivered in his Word! It is natural by creation to worship God; and it is as
natural by corruption for man to worship him in a human way, and not in a divine; is not this to impose
laws upon God, to esteem ourselves wiser than he? to think him negligent of his own service, and that our
feeble brains can find out ways to accommodate his honor, better than himself hath done? Thus do men
for the most part equal their own imaginations to God’s oracles: as Solomon built a high place to Moloch
and Chemoch, upon the Mount of Olives, to face on the east part Jerusalem and the temple;232 this is not
only to impose laws on God, but also to make self the standard of them.
</p>
<p>
    8. It is evidenced, in suiting interpretations of Scripture to their own minds and humors. Like the
Lacedæmonians, that dressed the images of their gods according to the fashion of their own country, we
would wring Scripture to serve our own designs, and judge the law of God by the law of sin, and make the
serpentine seed in us to be the interpreter of divine oracles: this is like Belshazzar to drink healths out of
the sacred vessels. As God is the author of his law and word, so he is the best interpreter of it; the
Scripture having an impress of divine wisdom, holiness, and goodness, must be regarded according to that
impress, with a submission and meekness of spirit and reverence of God in it; but when, in our inquiries
into the word, we inquire not of God, but consult flesh and blood, the temper of the times wherein we
live, or the satisfaction of a party we side withal, and impose glosses upon it according to our own
fancies, it is to put laws upon God, and make self the rule of him. He that interprets the law to bolster up
some eager appetite against the will of the lawgiver, ascribes to himself as great an authority as he that
enacted it.
</p>
<p>
    9. In falling off from God after some fair compliances, when his will grateth upon us, and crosseth
ours. They will walk with him as far as he pleaseth them, and leave him upon the first distaste, as though
God must observe their humors more than they his will. Amos must be suspended from prophesying,
because the “land could not bear his words,” and his discourses condemned their unworthy practices
against God.233 The young man came not to receive directions from our Saviour, but expected a
confirmation of his own rules, rather than an imposition of new.234 He rather cares for commendations
than instructions, and upon the disappointment turns his back; “he was sad,” that Christ would not suffer
him to be rich, and a Christian together; and leaves him because his command was not suitable to the law
of his covetousness. Some truths that are at a further distance from us, we can hear gladly; but when the
conscience begins to smart under others, if God will not observe our wills, we will, with Herod, be a law
to ourselves.235 More instances might be observed.—Ingratitude is a setting up self, and an imposing laws
on God. It is as much as to say, God did no more than he was obliged to do; as if the mercies we have
were an act of duty in God, and not of bounty.—Insatiable desires after wealth: hence are those speeches
(James 4:13), “We will go into such a city, and buy and sell, &amp;c. to get gain;” as though they had the
command of God, and God must lacquey after their wills. When our hearts are not contented with any
supply of our wants, but are craving an overplus for our lust; when we are unsatisfied in the midst of
plenty, and still like the grave, cry, Give, give.—Incorrigibleness under affliction, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    II. The second main thing: As man would be a law to himself, so he would be his own end and
happiness in opposition to God. Here four things shall be discoursed on. 1. Man would make himself his
own end and happiness. 2. He would make anything his end and happiness rather than God. 3. He would
make himself the end of all creatures. 4. He would make himself the end of God.
</p>
<p>
    First, Man would make himself his own end and happiness. As God ought to be esteemed the first
cause, in point of our dependence on him, so he ought to be our last end, in point of our enjoyment of
him. When we therefore trust in ourselves, we refuse him as the first cause; and when we act for
ourselves, and expect a blessedness from ourselves, we refuse him as the chiefest good, and last end,
which is an undeniable piece of atheism; for man is a creature of a higher rank than others in the world,
and was not made as animals, plants, and other works of the divine power, materially to glorify God, but a
rational creature, intentionally to honor God by obedience to his rule, dependence on his goodness, and
zeal for his glory. It is, therefore, as much a slighting of God, for man, a creature, to set himself up as his
own end, as to regard himself as his own law. For the discovery of this, observe that there is a three-fold
self-love.
</p>
<p>
    1. Natural, which is common to us by the law of nature with other creatures, inanimate as well as
animate, and so closely twisted with the nature of every creature, that it cannot be dissolved but with the
dissolution of nature itself. It consisted not with the wisdom and goodness of God to create an unnatural
nature, or to command anything unnatural, nor doth he; for when lie commands us to sacrifice ourselves,
and dearest lives for himself, it is not without a promise of a more noble state of being in exchange for
what we lose. This self-love is not only commendable, but necessary, as a rule to measure that duty we
owe to our neighbor, whom we cannot love as ourselves, if we do not first love ourselves. God having
planted this self-love in our nature, makes this natural principle the measure of our affection to all
mankind of the same blood with ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    2. Carnal self-love: when a man loves himself above God, in opposition to God, with a contempt of
God; when our thoughts, affections, designs, centre only in our own fleshly interest, and rifle God of his
honor, to make a present of it to ourselves: thus the natural self-love, in itself good, becomes criminal by
the excess, when it would be superior and not subordinate to God.
</p>
<p>
    3. A gracious self-love: when we love ourselves for higher ends than the nature of a creature, as a
creature dictates, viz. in subserviency to the glory of God. This is a reduction of the revolted creature to
his true and happy order; a Christian is therefore said to be “created in Christ to good works.”236 As all
creatures were created, not only for themselves, but for the honor of God; so the grace of the new creation
carries a man to answer this end, and to order all his operations to the honor of God, and his well-
pleasing. The first is from nature, the second from sin, the third from grace; the first is implanted by
creation, the second the fruit of corruption, and the third is by the powerful operation of grace. This carnal
self love is set up in the stead of God as our last end; like the sea, which all the little and great streams of
our actions run to and rest in. And this is, 1. Natural. It sticks as close to us as our souls; it is as natural as
sin, the foundation of all the evil in the world. As self-abhorrency is the first stone that is laid in
conversion, so an inordinate self-love was the first inlet to all iniquity. As grace is a rising from self to
centre in God, so is sin a shrinking from God into the mire of a carnal selfishness; since every creature is
nearest to itself and next to God, it cannot fall from God, but must immediate)y sink into self;237 and,
therefore, all sins are well said to be branches or modifications of this fundamental passion. What is
wrath, but a defence and strengthening self against the attempts of some real or imaginary evil? Whence
springs envy, but from a self-love, grieved at its own wants in the midst of another’s enjoyment, able to
supply it? What is impatience, but a regret that self is not provided for at the rate of our wish, and that it
hath met with a shock against supposed merit? What is pride, but a sense of self-worth, a desire to have
self of a higher elevation than others? What is drunkenness, but a seeking a satisfaction for sensual self in
the spoils of reason? No sin is committed as sin, but as it pretends a self-satisfaction. Sin, indeed, may
well be termed a man’s self, because it is, since the loss of original righteousness, the form that
overspreads every part of our souls. The understanding assents to nothing false but under the notion of
true, and the will embraceth nothing evil but under the notion of good; but the rule whereby we measure
the truth and goodness of proposed objects, is not the unerring Word, but the inclinations of self, the
gratifying of which is the aim of our whole lives. Sin and self are all one: what is called a living to sin in
one place,238 is called a living to self in another: “That they that live should not live unto themselves.”239
And upon this account it is that both the Hebrew word, ‫חטץ‬, and the Greek word, ἁμαρτάνειν, used in
Scripture to express sin, properly signify to miss the mark, and swerve from that white to which all our
actions should be directed, viz. the glory of God. When we fell to loving ourselves, we fell from loving
God; and, therefore, when the Psalmist saith (Psalm 14:2), there were none that sought God, viz. as the
last end; he presently adds, “They are all gone aside,” viz. from their true mark, and therefore become
filthy. 2. Since it is natural, it is also universal.240 The not seeking God is as universal as our ignorance of
him. No man in a state of nature but hath it predominant; no renewed man on this side heaven but hath it
partially. The one hath it flourishing, the other hath it struggling. If to aim at the glory of God as the chief
end, and not to live to ourselves, be the greatest mark of the restoration of the divine image,241 and a
conformity to Christ, who glorified not himself,242 but the Father;243 then every man, wallowing in the
mire of corrupt nature, pays a homage to self, as a renewed man is biassed by the honor of God. The Holy
Ghost excepts none from this crime (Phil. 2:21): “All seek their own.” It is rare for them to look above or
beyond themselves. Whatsoever may be the immediate subject of their thoughts and inquiries, yet the
utmost end and stage is their profit, honor, or pleasure. Whatever it be that immediately possesses the
mind and will, self sits like a queen, and sways the sceptre, and orders things at that rate, that God is
excluded, and can find no room in all his thoughts (Psalm 10:4): “The wicked, through the pride of his
countenance, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.” The whole little world of man is so
overflowed with a deluge of self, that the dove, the glory of the Creator, can find no place where to set its
foot; and if ever it gain the favor of admittance, it is to disguise and be a vassal to some carnal project, as
the glory of God was a mask for the murdering his servants. It is from the power of this principle that the
difficulty of conversion ariseth: as there is no greater pleasure to a believing soul than the giving itself up
to God, and no stronger desire in him, than to have a fixed and unchangeable will to serve the designs of
his honor; so there is no greater torment to a wicked man, than to part with his carnal ends, and lay down
the Dagon of self at the feet of the ark. Self love and self-opinion in the Pharisees waylaid all the
entertainment of truth (John 5:44): “They sought honor one of another, and not the honor which comes
from God.” It is of so large an extent, and so insinuating nature, that it winds itself into the exercise of
moral virtues, mixeth with our charity (Matt. 6:2), and finds nourishment in the ashes of martyrdom (1
Cor. 13:3).
</p>
<p>
     This making ourselves our end will appear in a few things.
</p>
<p>
     1. In frequent self-applauses, and inward overweening reflections. Nothing more ordinary in the
natures of men, than a dotage on their own perfections, acquisitions, or actions in the world: “Most think
of themselves above what they ought to think” (Rom. 12:3, 4.) Few think of themselves so meanly as they
ought to think: this sticks as close to us as our skin; and as humility is the beauty of grace, this is the
filthiest soil of nature. Our thoughts run more delightfully upon the track of our own perfections, than the
excellency of God; and when we find anything of a seeming worth, that may make us glitter in the eyes of
the world, how cheerfully do we grasp and embrace ourselves! When the grosser profanenesses of men
have been discarded, and the floods of them dammed up, the head of corruption, whence they sprang, will
swell the higher within, in self-applauding speculations of their own reformation, without
acknowledgment of their own weaknesses, and desires of divine assistance to make a further progress. “I
thank God I am not like this publican;”244 a self-reflection, with a contempt rather than compassion to his
neighbor, is frequent in every Pharisee. The vapors of self-affections, in our clouded understandings, like
those in the air in misty mornings, alter the appearance of things, and make them look bigger than they
are. This is thought by some to be the sin of the fallen angels, who, reflecting apon their own natural
excellency superior to other creatures, would find a blessedness in their own nature, as God did in his, and
make themselves the last end of their actions. It is from this principle we are naturally so ready to
compare ourselves rather with those that are below us, than with those that are above us; and often think
those that are above us inferior to us, and secretly glory that we are become none of the meanest and
lowest in natural or moral excellencies. How far were the gracious penmen of the Scripture from this,
who, when possessed and directed by the Spirit of God, and filled with a sense of him, instead of
applauding themselves, publish upon record their own faults to all the eyes of the world! And if Peter, as
some think, dictated the Gospel which Mark wrote as his amanuensis, it is observable that his crime in
denying his Master is aggravated in that Gospel in some circumstances, and less spoken of his repentance
than in the other evangelists: “When he thought thereon, he wept;”245 but in the other, “He went out and
wept bitterly.”246 This is one part of atheism and self-idolatry, to magnify ourselves with the
forgetfulness, and to the injury of our Creator.
</p>
<p>
     2. In ascribing the glory of what we do or have to ourselves, to our own wisdom, power, virtue, &amp;c.
How flaunting is Nebuchadnezzar at the prospect of Babylon, which he had exalted to be the head of so
great an empire! (Dan. 4:30): “Is not this great Babylon that I have built? For,” &amp;c. He struts upon the
battlements of his palace, as if there were no God but himself in the world, while his eye could not but see
the heavens above him to be none of his own framing, attributing his acquisitions to his own arm, and
referring them to his own honor, for his own delight; not for the honor of God, as a creature ought, nor for
the advantage of his subjects, as the duty of a prince. He regards Babylon as his heaven, and himself as
his idol, as if he were all, and God nothing. An example of this we have in the present age. But it is often
observed, that God vindicates his own honor, brings the most heroical men to contempt and unfortunate
ends, as a punishment of their pride, as he did here (Dan. 4:31): “While the word was in the king’s mouth,
there fell a voice from heaven,” &amp;c. This was Herod’s crime, to suffer others to do it:247 he had discovered
his eloquence actively, and made himself his own end passively, in approving the flatteries of the people,
and offered not with one hand to God the glory he received from his people with the other.248
Samosatenus is reported to put down the hymns which were sung for the glory of God and Christ, and
caused songs to be sung in the temple for his own honor. When anything succeeds well, we are ready to
attribute it to our own prudence and industry: if we meet with a cross, we fret against the stars and
fortune, and second causes, and sometimes against God: as they curse God as well as their king (Isa.
8:21), not acknowledging any defect in themselves. The Psalmist, by his repetition of, “Not unto us, not
unto us, but to thy name give glory” (Psalm 115:1), implies the naturality of this temper, and the difficulty
to cleanse our hearts from those self-reflections. If it be angelical to refuse an undue glory stolen from
God’s throne (Rev. 22:8, 9), it is diabolical to accept and cherish it. To seek our own glory is not glory
(Prov. 25:27). It is vile, and the dishonor of a creature, who by the law of his creation is referred to
another end. So much as we sacrifice to our own credit, to the dexterity of our hands, or the sagacity of
our wit, we detract from God.
</p>
<p>
     3. In desires to have self-pleasing doctrines. When we cannot endure to hear anything that crosses the
flesh; though the wise man tells us, it is better to hear the “rebuke of the wise, than the song of fools”
(Eccles. 7:5). If Hanani the seer reprove king Asa for not relying on the Lord, his passion shall be armed
for self against the prophet, and arrest him a prisoner (2 Chron. 16:10). If Micaiah declare to Ahab the evil
that shall befall him, Amon the governor shall receive orders to clap him up in a dungeon. Fire doth not
sooner seize upon combustible matter than fury will be kindled, if self be but pinched. This interest of
lustful self barred the heart of Herodias against the entertainment of the truth, and caused her savagely to
dip her hands in the blood of the Baptist, to make him a sacrifice to that inward idol.249
</p>
<p>
     4. In being highly concerned for injuries done to ourselves, and little or not at all concerned for
injuries done to God. How will the blood rise in us, when our honor and reputation is invaded, and scarce
reflect upon the dishonor God suffers in our sight and hearing! Violent passions will transform us into
Boanerges in the one case, and our unconcernedness render us Gallios in the other. We shall extenuate
that which concerns God, and aggravate that which concerns ourselves. Nothing but the death of
Jonathan, a first-born and a generous son, will satisfy his father Saul, when the authority of his edict was
broken by his tasting of honey, though he had recompensed his crime committed in ignorance by the
purchase of a gallant victory. But when the authority of God was violated in saving the Amalekites’ cattle,
against the command of a greater sovereign than himself, he can daub the business, and excuse it with a
design of sacrificing. He was not so earnest in hindering the people from the breach of God’s command,
as he was in vindicating the honor of his own:250 he could hardly admit of an excuse to salve his own
honor; but in the concerns of God’s honor, pretend piety, to cloak his avarice. And it is often seen, when
the violation of God’s authority, and the stain of our own reputation are coupled together, we are more
troubled for what disgraces us than for what dishonors God. When Saul had thus transgressed, he is
desirous that Samuel would turn again to preserve his own honor before the elders, rather than grieved
that he had broken the command of God (ver. 30).
</p>
<p>
     5. In trusting in ourselves. When we consult with our own wit and wisdom, more than inquire of God,
and ask leave of him: as the Assyrian (Isa. 10:13), “By the strength of my hands I have done it, and by my
wisdom; for I am prudent.” When we attempt things in the strength of our own heads, and parts, and trust
in our own industry, without application to God for direction, blessing, and success, we affect the
privilege of the Deity, and make gods of ourselves. The same language in reality with Ajax in Sophocles:
“Others think to overcome with the assistance of the gods, but I hope to gain honor without them.”
Dependence and trust is an act due from the creature only to God. Hence God aggravates the crime of the
Jews in trusting in Egypt (Isa. 31:3), “the Egyptians are men and not gods.” Confidence in ourselves is a
defection from God (Jer. 17:5). And when we depart from and cast off God to depend upon ourselves,
which is but an arm of flesh, we choose the arm of flesh for our God; we rob God of that confidence we
ought to place in him, and that adoration which is due to him, and build it upon another foundation; not
that we are to neglect the reason and parts God hath given us, or spend more time in prayer than in
consulting about our own affairs, but to mix our own intentions in business, with ejaculations to heaven,
and take God along with us in every motion: but certainly it is an idolizing of self, when we are more
diligent in our attendance on our own wit, than fervent in our recourses to God.
</p>
<p>
     6. The power of sinful self, above the efficacy of the notion of God, is evident in our workings for
carnal self against the light of our own consciences. When men of sublime reason, and clear natural
wisdom, are voluntary slaves to their own lusts, row against the stream of their own consciences, serve
carnal self with a disgraceful and disturbing drudgery, making it their God, sacrificing natural self, all
sentiments of virtue, and the quiet of their lives, to the pleasure, honor, and satisfaction of carnal self: this
is a prostituting God in his deputy, conscience, to carnal affections, when their eyes are shut against the
enlightenings of it, and their ears deaf to its voice, but open to the least breath and whisper of self; a debt
that the creature owes supremely to God. Much more might be said, but let us see what atheism lurks in
this, and how it entrencheth upon God.
</p>
<p>
     1. It is usurping God’s prerogative. It is God’s prerogative to be his own end, and act for his own
glory; because there is nothing superior to him in excellency and goodness to act for: he had not his being
from anything without himself, whereby he should be obliged to act for anything but himself. To make
ourselves then our last end, is to corrival God in his being the supreme good, and blessedness to himself:
as if we were our own principle, the author of our own being, and were not obliged to a higher power than
ourselves, for what we are and have. To direct the lines of all our motions to ourselves, is to imply that
they first issued only from ourselves. When we are rivals to God in his chief end, we own or desire to be
rivals to him in the principle of his being: this is to set ourselves in the place of God. All things have
something without them, and above them as their end; all inferior creatures act for some superior order in
the rank of creation; the lesser animals are designed for the greater, and all for man: man, therefore, for
something nobler than himself. To make ourselves therefore our own end, is to deny any, superior, to
whom we are to direct our actions. God alone being the supreme Being, can be his own ultimate end: for
if there were anything higher and better than God, the purity and righteousness of his own nature would
cause him to act for and toward that as his chiefest mark: this is the highest sacrilege, to alienate the
proper good and rights of God, and employ them for our own use; to steal from him his own honor, and
put it into our own cabinets; like those birds that ravished the sacrifice from the altar and carried it to their
own nests.251 When we love only ourselves, and act for no other end but ourselves, we invest ourselves
with the dominion which is the right of God, and take the crown from his head. For as the crown belongs
to the king, so to love his own will, to will by his own will and for himself, is the property of God;
because he hath no other will, no other end above him to be the rule and scope of his actions. When
therefore we are by self-love transformed wholly into ourselves, we make ourselves our own foundation,
without God and against God; when we mind our own glory and praise, we would have a royal state equal
with God, who created all things for himself.252 What can man do more for God than he naturally doth for
himself, since he dotb all those things for himself which he should do for God? We own ourselves to be
our own creators and benefactors, and fling off all sentiments of gratitude to him.
</p>
<p>
     2. It is a vilifying of God. When we make ourselves our end, it is plain language that God is not our
happiness; we postpone God to ourselves, as if he were not an object so excellent and fit for our love as
ourselves are (for it is irrational to make that our end, which is not God, and not the chiefest good); it is to
deny him to be better than we, to make him not to be so good as ourselves, and so fit to be our chiefest
good as ourselves are; that he hath not deserved any such acknowledgment at our hands by all that he hath
done for us: we assert ourselves his superiors by such kind of acting, though we are infinitely more
inferior to God than any creature can be to us. Man cannot dishonor God more than by referring that to his
own glory, which God made for his own praise, upon account whereof he only hath a right to glory and
praise, and none else. He thus “changeth the glory of the incorruptible God into a corruptible image;”253 a
perishing fame and reputation, which extends but little beyond the limits of his own habitation; or if it
doth, survives but a few years, and perishes at last with the age wherein he lived.
</p>
<p>
     3. It is as much as in us lies a destroying of God. By this temper we destroy that God that made us,
because we destroy his intention and his honor. God cannot outlive his will and his glory: because he
cannot have any other rule but his own will, or any other end but his own honor. The setting up self as our
end puts a nullity upon the true Deity; by paying to ourselves that respect and honor which is due to God,
we make the true God as no God. Whosoever makes himself a king of his prince’s rights and territories,
manifests an intent to throw him out of his government. To choose ourselves as our end is to undeify God,
since to be the last end of a rational creature is a right inseparable from the nature of the Deity; and
therefore not to set God, but self always before us, is to acknowledge no being but ourselves to be God.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly. The second thing, Man would make anything his end and happiness rather than God. An
end is so necessary in all our actions, that he deserves not the name of a rational creature that proposeth
not one to himself. This is the distinction between rational creatures and others; they act with a formal
intention, whereas other creatures are directed to their end by a natural instinct, and moved by nature to
what the others should be moved by reason: when a man, therefore, acts for that end which was not
intended him by the law of his creation, nor is suited to the noble faculties of his soul, he acts contrary to
God, overturns his order, and merits no better a title than that of an atheist. A man may be said two ways
to make a thing his last end and chief good.
</p>
<p>
     1. Formally. When he actually judges this or that thing to be his chiefest good, and orders all things to
it. So man doth not formally judge sin to be good, or any object which is the incentive of sin to be his last
end: this cannot be while he hath the exercise of his rational faculties.
</p>
<p>
     2. Virtually and implicitly. When he loves anything against the command of God, and prefers in the
stream of his actions the enjoyment of that, before the fruition of God, and lays out more strength and
expends more time in the gaining that, than answering the true end of his creation. when he acts so as if
something below God could make him happy without God, or that God could not make him happy
without the addition of something else. Thus the glutton makes a god of his dainties; the ambitious man of
his honor; the incontinent man of his lust; and the covetous man of his wealth; and consequently esteems
them as his chiefest good, and the most noble end, to which he directs his thoughts: thus he vilifies and
lessens the true God, which can make him happy, in a multitude of false gods, that can only render him
miserable. He that loves pleasure more than God, says in his heart there is no God but his pleasure. He
that loves his belly more than God, says in his heart there is no God but his belly: their happiness is not
accounted to lie in that God that made the world, but in the pleasure or profit they make their god. In this,
though a created object be the immediate and subordinate term to which we turn, yet principally and
ultimately, the affection to it terminates in self. Nothing is naturally entertained by us, but as it affects our
sense or mingles with some promise of advantage to us. This is seen,
</p>
<p>
    1. In the fewer thoughts we have of God than of anything else. Did we apprehend God to be our
chiefest good and highest end, should we grudge him the pains of a few days’ thoughts upon him? Men in
their travels are frequently thinking upon their intended stage: but our thoughts run upon new acquisitions
to increase our wealth, rear up our families, revenge our injuries, and support our reputation: trifles
possess us; but “God is not in all our thoughts;”254 seldom the sole object of them. We have durable
thoughts of transitory things, and flitting thoughts of a durable and eternal good. The covenant of grace
engageth the whole heart to God, and bars anything else from engrossing it: but what strangers are God
and the souls of most men! Though we have the knowledge of him by creation, yet he is for the most part
an unknown God in the relations wherein he stands to us, because a God undelighted in: hence it is, as
one observes, that because we observe not the ways of God’s wisdom, conceive not of him in his vast
perfections, nor are stricken with an admiration of his goodness, that we have fewer good sacred poems,
than of any other kind.255 The wits of men hang the wing when they come to exercise their reasons and
fancies about God. Parts and strength are given us, as well as corn and wine to the Israelites, for the
service of God; but those are consecrated to some cursed Baal.256 Like Venus in the Poet, we forsake
heaven to follow some Adonis.
</p>
<p>
    2. In the greedy pursuit of the world.257 When we pursue worldly wealth or worldly reputation with
more vehemency than the riches of grace, or the favor of God;—when we have a foolish imagination, that
our happiness consists in them, we prefer earth before heaven, broken cisterns which can hold no water,
before an ever-springing fountain of glory and bliss; and, as though there were a defect in God, cannot be
content with him as our portion, without an addition of something inferior to him;—when we make it our
hopes, and say to the wedge, “Thou art my confidence;” and rejoice more because it is great, and because
“our hand hath gotten much, than in the privilege of communion with God and the promise of an
everlasting fruition of him;”258 this is so gross, that Job joins it with the idolatry of the sun and moon,
which he purgeth himself of (31:26). And the apostle, when he mentions covetousness or covetous men,
passes it not over without the title of idolatry to the vice, and idolater to the person;259 in that it is a
preferring clay and dirt as an end more desirable than the original of all goodness, in regard of affection
and dependence.

    3. In a strong addictedness to sensual pleasures (Phil. 3:19). Who make their “belly their god;”
subjecting the truths of God to the maintenance of their luxury. In debasing the higher faculties to project
for the satisfaction of the sensitive appetite as their chief happiness, whereby many render themselves no
better than a rout of aublimated brutes among men, and gross atheists to God. When men’s thoughts run
also upon inventing new methods to satisfy their bestial appetite, forsaking the pleasures which are to be
had in God, which are the delights of angels, for the satisfaction of brutes. This is an open and
unquestionable refusal of God for our end, when our rest is in them, as if they were the chief good, and
not God.
</p>
<p>
    4. In paying a service, upon any success in the world, to instruments more than to God, their sovereign
Author. When “they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag.”260 Not that the Assyrian did
offer a sacrifice to his arms, but ascribed to them what was due only to God, and appropriated the victory
to his forces and arms. The prophet alludes to those that worshipped their warlike instruments, whereby
they had attained great victories; and those artificers who worshipped the tools by which they had
purchased great wealth, in the stead of God; preferring them as the causes of their happiness, before God
who governs the world. And are not our affections, upon the receiving of good things, more closely fixed
to the instruments of conveyance, than to the chief Benefactor, from whose coffers they are taken? Do we
not more delight in them, and hug them with a greater endearedness, as if all our happiness depended on
them, and God were no more than a bare spectator? Just as if when a man were warmed by a beam, he
should adore that and not admire the sun that darts it out upon him.
</p>
<p>
    5. In paying a respect to man more than God. When in a public attendance on his service, we will not
laugh, or be garish, because men see us; but our hearts shall be in a ridiculous posture, playing with
feathers and trifling fancies, though God see us; as though our happiness consisted in the pleasing of men,
and our misery in a respect to God. There is no fool that saith in his heart, There is no God, but he sets up
something in his heart as a god. This is,
</p>
<p>
    1. A debasing of God, (1.) In setting up a creature. It speaks God less amiable than the creature, short
of those perfections which some silly, sordid thing, which hath engrossed their affections, is possessed
with; as if the cause of all being could be transcended by his creature, and a vile lust could equal, yea,
surmount the loveliness of God. It is to say to God, as the rich to the poor (James 2:3), “Stand thou there,
or sit here under my footstool;” it is to sink him below the mire of the world, to order him to come down
from his glorious throne, and take his place below a contemptible creature, which, in regard of its infinite
distance, is not to be compared with him. It strips God of the love that is due to him by the right of his
nature and the greatness of his dignity; and of the trust that is due to him, as the First Cause and the
chiefest good, as though he were too feeble and mean to be our blessedness. This is intolerable, to make
that which is God’s footstool, the earth, to climb up into his throne; to set that in our heart which God hath
made even below ourselves and put under our feet; to make that which we trample upon to dispose of the
right God hath to our hearts.261 It is worse than if a queen should fall in love with the little image of the
prince in the palace, and slight the beauty of his person; and as if people should adore the footsteps of a
king in the dirt, and turn their backs upon his presence. (2.) It doth more debase him to set up a sin, a lust,
a carnal affection as our chief end. To steal away the honor due to God, and appropriate it to that which is
no work of his hands, to that which is loathsome in his sight, hath disturbed his rest, and wrung out his
just breath to kindle a hell for its eternal lodging, a God-dishonoring and a soul-murdering lust, is worse
than to prefer Barabbas before Christ. The baser the thing, the worse is the injury to him with whom we
would associate it. If it were some generous principle, a thing useful to the world, that we place in an
equality with, or a superiority above him, though it were a vile usage, yet it were not altogether so
criminal; but to gratify some unworthy appetite with the displeasure of the Creator, something below the
rational nature of man, much more infinitely below the excellent majesty of God, is a more unworthy
usage of him. To advance one of the most virtuous nobles in a kingdom as a mark of our service and
subjection, is not so dishonorable to a despised prince as to take a scabby beggar or a rotten carcase to
place in his throne. Creeping things, abominable beasts, the Egyptian idols, cats and crocodiles, were
greater abominations, and a greater despite done to God, than the image of jealousy at the gate of the
altar.262 And let not any excuse themselves, that it is but one lust or one creature which is preferred as the
end: is not he an idolater that worships the sun or moon, one idol, as well as he that worships the whole
host of heaven? The inordinacy of the heart to one lust may imply a stronger contempt of him, than if a
legion of lusts did possess the heart. It argues a greater disesteem, when he shall be slighted for a single
vanity. The depth of Esau’s profaneness in contemning his birth-right, and God in it, is aggravated by his
selling it for one morsel of meat,263 and that none of the daintiest, none of the costliest—a mess of
pottage; implying, had he parted with it at a greater rate, it had been more tolerable, and his profaneness
more excusable. And it is reckoned as a high aggravation of the corruption of the Israelite judges (Amos
2:6), that they sold the poor for a pair of shoes; that is, that they would betray the cause of the poor for a
bribe of no greater value than might purchase them a pair of shoes. To place any one thing as our chief
end, though never so light, doth not excuse. He that will not stick to break with God for a trifle, a small
pleasure, will leap the hedge upon a greater temptation. Nay, and if wealth, riches, friends, and the best
thing in the world, our own lives, be preferred before God, as our chief happiness and end but one
moment, it is an infinite wrong, because the infinite goodness and excellency of God is denied; as though
the creature or lust we love, or our own life, which we prefer in that short moment before him, had a
goodness in itself, superior to, and more desirable than the blessedness in God. And tough it should be but
one minute, and a man in all the period of his days, both before and after that failure, should actually and
intentionally prefer God before all other things; yet he doth him an infinite wrong, because God in every
moment is infinitely good, and absolutely desirable, and can never cease to be good, and cannot have the
least shadow or change in him and his perfections.
</p>
<p>
     2. It is a denying of God (Job 31:26–28): “If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
its brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand; this also were
iniquity to be punished by the judge, for I should have denied the Lord above.” This denial of God is not
only the act of an open idolater, but the consequent of a secret confidence, and immoderate joy in worldly
goods. This denial of God is to be referred to ver. 24, 25. When a man saith to gold, “Thou art my
confidence,” and rejoices because his wealth is great; he denies that God which is superior to all those,
and the proper object of trust. Both idolatries are coupled here together; that which hath wealth and that
which hath those glorious creatures in heaven for its object. And though some may think it a light sin, yet
the crime being of deeper guilt, a denial of God, deserves a severer punishment, and falls under the
sentence of the just Judge of all the earth, under that notion which Job intimates in those words, “This also
were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge.” The kissing the hand to the sun, moon, or any idol, was an
external sign of religious worship among those and other nations. This is far less than an inward hearty
confidence, and an affectionate trust. If the motion of the hand be, much more the affection of the heart to
an excrementitious creature, or a brutish pleasure, is a denial of God, and a kind of an abjuring of him,
since the supreme affection of the soul is undoubtedly and solely the right of the Sovereign Creator, and
not to be given in common to others, as the outward gesture may in a way of civil respect. Nothing that is
an honor peculiar to God can be given to a creature, without a plain exclusion of God to be God; it being a
disowning the rectitude and excellency of his nature. If God should command a creature such a love, and
such a confidence in anything inferior to him, he would deny himself his own glory, he would deny
himself to be the most excellent being. Can the Romanists be free from this, when they call the cross spem
unicam, and say to the Virgin, In te Domina speravi, as Bonaventure? &amp;c. Good reason, therefore, have
worldlings and sensualists, persons of immoderate fondness to anything in the world, to reflect upon
themselves; since though they own the being of God, they are guilty of so great disrespect to him, that
cannot be excused from the title of an unworthy atheism; and those that are renewed by the spirit of God,
may here see ground of a daily humiliation for the frequent and too common excursions of their souls in
creature confidences and affections, whereby they fall under the charge of an act of practical atheism,
though they may be free from a habit of it.
</p>
<p>
     Thirdly, Man would make himself the end of all creatures. Man would sit in the seat of God, and set
his heart as the heart of God, as the Lord saith of Tyrus (Ezek. 28:2). What is the consequence of this, but
to be esteemed the chief good and end of other creatures? a thing that the heart of God cannot but be set
upon, it being an inseparable right of the Deity, who must deny himself if he deny this affection of the
heart. Since it is the nature of man, derived from his root, to desire to be equal with God, it follows that he
desires no creature should be equal with him, but subservient to his ends and his glory. He that would
make himself God, would have the honor proper to God. He that thinks himself worthy of his own
supreme affection, thinks himself worthy to be the object of the supreme affection of others. Whosoever
counts himself the chiefest good and last end, would have the same place in the thoughts of others.
Nothing is more natural to man than a desire to have his own judgment the rule and measure of the
judgments and opinions of the rest of mankind. He that sets himself in the place of the prince, doth, by
that act, challenge all the prerogatives and dues belonging to the prince; and apprehending himself fit to
be a king, apprehends himself also worthy of the homage and fealty of the subjects. He that loves himself
chiefly, and all other things and persons for himself, would make himself the end of all creatures. It hath
not been once or twice only in the world that some vain princes have assumed to themselves the title of
gods, and caused divine adorations to be given to them, and altars to smoke with sacrifices for their honor.
What hath been practised by one, is by nature seminally in all; we would have all pay an obedience to us,
and give to us the esteem that is due to God. This is evident,
</p>
<p>
     1. In pride. When we entertain a high opinion of ourselves, and act for our own reputes, we dispossess
God from our own hearts; and while we would have our fame to be in every man’s mouth, and be admired
in the hearts of men, we would chase God out of the hearts of others, and deny his glory a residence
anywhere else, that our glory should reside more in their minds than the glory of God; that their thoughts
should be filled with our achievements, more than the works and excellency of God, with our image, and
not with the divine. Pride would paramount God in the affections of others, and justle God out of their
souls; and by the same reason that man doth thus in the place where he lives, he would do so in the whole
world, and press the whole creation from the service of their true Lord, to his own service. Every proud
man would be counted by others as he counts himself, the highest, chiefest piece of goodness, and be
adored by others, as much as he adores and admires himself. No proud man, in his self-love, and self
admiration, thinks himself in an error; and if he be worthy of his own admiration, he thinks himself
worthy of the highest esteem of others, that they should value him above themselves, and value
themselves only for him. What did Nebuchadnezzar intend by setting up a golden image, and
commanding all his subjects to worship it, upon the highest penalty he could inflict, but that all should
aim only at the pleasing his humor?
</p>
<p>
     2. In using the creatures contrary to the end God has appointed. God created the world and all things
in it, as steps whereby men might ascend to a prospect of him, and the acknowledgment of his glory; and
we would use them to dishonor God, and gratify ourselves: he appointed them to supply our necessities,
and support our rational delights, and we use them to cherish our sinful lusts. We wring groans from the
creature in diverting them from their true scope to one of our own fixing, when we use them not in his
service, but purely for our own, and turn those things he created for himself, to be instruments of rebellion
against him to serve our turns, and hereby endeavor to defeat the ends of God in them, to establish our
own ends by them: this is a high dishonor to God, a sacrilegious undermining of his glory,264 to reduce
what God hath made to serve our own glory and our own pleasure; it perverts the whole order of the
world, and directs it to another end than what God hath constituted,. to another intention contrary to the
intention of God; and thus man makes himself a God by his own authority. As all things were made by
God, so they are for God; but while we aspire to the end of the creation, we deny and envy God the honor
of being Creator; we cannot make ourselves the chief end of the creatures against God’s order, but we
imply thereby that we were their first principle; for if we lived under a sense of the Creator of them while
we enjoy there for our use, we should return the glory to the right owner. This is diabolical; though the
devil, for his first affecting an authority in heaven, has been hurled down from the state of an angel of
light into that of darkness, vileness, and misery, to be the most accursed creature living, yet he still aspires
to mate God, contrary to the knowledge of the impossibility of success in it. Neither the terrors he feels,
nor the future torments he doth expect, do a jot abate his ambition to be competitor with his Creator; how
often hath he, since his first sin, arrogated to himself the honor of a God from the blind world, and
attempted to make the Son of God, by a particular worship, count him as the “chiefest good and
benefactor of the world!”265 Since all men by nature are the devil’s children, the serpent’s seed, they have
something of this venom in their natures, as well as others of his qualities. We see that there may be, and
is a prodigious atheism, lurking under the belief of a God; the devil knows there is a God, but acts like an
atheist; and so do his children.
</p>
<p>
     Fourthly, Man would make himself the end of God. This necessarily follows upon the former;
whosoever makes himself his own law and his own end in the place of God, would make God the subject
in making himself the sovereign; he that steps into the throne of a prince, sets the prince at his footstool;
and while he assumes the prince’s prerogative, demands a subjection from him. The order of the creation
has been inverted by the entrance of sin.266 God implanted an affection in man with a double aspect, the
one to pitch upon God, the other to respect ourselves; but with this proviso, that our affection to God
should be infinite, in regard of the object, and centre in him as the chiefest happiness and highest end. Our
affections to ourselves should be finite, and refer ultimately to God as the original of our being; but sin
hath turned man’s affections wholly to himself, whereas he should love God first, and himself in order to
God; he now loves himself first, and God in order to himself; love to God is lost, and love to self hath
usurped the throne. As God by “creation put all things under the feet of man,”267 reserving the heart for
himself, man by corruption hath dispossessed God of his heart, and put him under his own feet. We often
intend ourselves when we pretend the honor of God, and make God and religion a stale to some designs
we have in hand; our Creator a tool for our own ends. This is evident,
</p>
<p>
     1. In our loving God, because of some self-pleasing benefits distributed by him. There is in men a
kind of natural love to God, but it is but a secondary one, because God gives them the good things of this
world, spreads their table, fills their cup, stuffs their coffers, and doth them some good turns by
unexpected providences; this is not an affection to God for the unbounded excellency of his own nature,
but for his beneficence, as he opens his hand for them; an affection to themselves, and those creatures,
their gold, their honor, which their hearts are most fixed upon, without a strong spiritual inclination that
God should be glorified by them in the use of those mercies. It is rather a disowning of God, than any love
to him, because it postpones God to those things they love him for; this would appear to be no love, if
God should cease to be their benefactor, and deal with them as a judge; if he should change his outward
smiles into afflicting frowns, and not only shut his hand, but strip them of what he sent them. The motive
of their love being expired, the affection raised by it must cease for want of fuel to feed it; so that God is
beholden to sordid creatures of no value (but as they are his creatures) for most of the love the sons of
men pretend to him. The devil spake truth of most men, though not of Job, when he said (Job 1:9): “They
love not God for naught;” but while he makes a hedge about them and their families, whilst he blesseth
the works of their hands, and increaseth their honor in the land. It is like Peter’s sharp reproof of his
Master, when he spake of the ill-usage, even to death, he was to meet with at Jerusalem: “This shall not be
unto thee.” It was as much out of love to himself, as zeal for his Master’s interest, knowing his Master
could not. be in such a storm without some drops lighting upon himself. All the apostasies of men in the
world are witnesses to this; they fawn whilst they may have a prosperous profession, but will not bear one
chip of the cross for the interest of God; they would partake of his blessings, but not endure the prick of a
lance for him, as those, that admired the miracles of our Saviour, and shrunk at his sufferings. A time of
trial discovers these mercenary souls to be more lovers of themselves than their Maker. This is a
pretended love of friendship to God, but a real love to a lust, only to gain by God. A good man’s temper is
contrary: “Quench hell, burn heaven,” said a holy man, “I will love and fear my God.”
</p>
<p>
     2. It is evident, in abstinence from some sins, not because they offend God, but because they are
against the interest of some other beloved corruption, or a bar to something men hunt after in the world.
When temperance is cherished not to honor God, but preserve a crazy carcase; prodigality forsaken, out of
a humor of avarice; uncleanness forsaken, not out of a hatred of lust, but love to their money; declining a
denial of the interest and truth of God, not out of affection to them, but an ambitious zeal for their own
reputation. There is a kind of conversion from sin, when God is not made the term of it (Jer. 4:1): “If thou
wilt return, O Israel, return unto me, saith the Lord.”268 When we forbear sin as dogs do the meat they
love: they forbear not out of a hatred of the carrion, but fear of the cudgel; these are as wicked in their
abstaining from sin, as others are in their furious committing it. Nothing of the honor of God and the end
of his appointments is indeed in all this, but the conveniences self gathers from them. Again, many of the
motives the generality of the world uses to their friends and relations to draw them from vices, are drawn
from self, and used to prop up natural or sinful self in them. Come, reform yourself, take other courses,
you will smut your reputation and be despicable; you will destroy your estate, and commence a beggar;
your family will be undone, and you may rot in a prison: not laying close to them the duty they owe to
God, the dishonor which accrues to him by their unworthy courses, and the ingratitude to the God of their
mercies; not that the other motives are to be laid aside and slighted. Mint and cummin may be tithed, but
the weightier concerns are not to be omitted; but this shows that self is the bias, not only of men in their
own course, but in their dealings with others; what should be subordinate to the honor of God, and the
duty we owe to him, is made superior.
</p>
<p>
     3. It is evident, in performing duties merely for a selfish interest: making ourselves the end of
religious actions, paying a homage to that, while we pretend to render it to God (Zech. 7:5): “Did you at
all fast unto me, even unto me?” Things ordained by God may fall in with carnal ends affected by
ourselves; and then religion is not kept up by any interest of God in the conscience, but the interest of self
in the heart: we then sanctify not the name of God in the duty, but gratify ourselves: God may be the
object, self is the end; and a heavenly object is made subservient to a carnal design. Hypocrisy passes a
compliment on God, and is called flattery (Psalm 78:36): ld;They did flatter him with their lips,” &amp;c.
They gave him a parcel of good words for their own preservation. Flattery, in the old notion among the
heathens, is a vice more peculiar to serve our own turn and purvey for the belly: they knew they could not
subsist without God, and therefore gave him a parcel of good words, that he might spare them, and make
provision for them. Israel is an empty vine,269 a vine, say some, with large branches and few clusters, but
bring forth fruit to himself: while they professed love to God with their lips, it was that God should
promote their covetous designs, and preserve their wealth and grandeur;270 in which respect a hypocrite
may be well termed a religious atheist, an atheist masked with religion. The chief arguments which
prevail with many men to perform some duties and appear religious, are the same that Hamor and
Shechem used to the people of their city to submit to circumcision, viz. the engrossing of more wealth
(Gen. 34:21, 22): “If every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised, shall not their cattle
and their substance, and every beast of theirs, be ours?” This is seen,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) In unwieldiness to religious duties where self is not concerned. With what lively thoughts will
many approach to God, when a revenue may be brought in to support their own ends! But when the
concerns of God only are in it, the duty is not the delight, but the clog; such feeble devotions, that warm
not the soul, unless there be something of self to give strength and heat to them. Jonah was sick of his
work, and run from God, because he thought he should get no honor by his message: God’s mercy would
discredit his prophecy.271 Thoughts of disadvantage cut the very sinews of service. You may as well
persuade a merchant to venture all his estate upon the inconstant waves without hopes of gain, as prevail
with a natural man to be serious in duty, without expectation of some warm advantage. “What profit
should we have if we pray to him?” is the natural question (Job 21:15). “What profit shall I have if I be
cleansed from my sin?” (Job 35:3). I shall have more good by my sin than by my service. It is for God
that I dance before the ark, saith David, therefore I will be more vile (2 Sam. 6:22). It is for self that I
pray, saith a natural man, therefore I will be more warm and quick. Ordinances of God are observed only
as a point of interest, and prayer is often most fervent, when it is least godly, and most selfish; carnal ends
and affections will pour out lively expressions. If there be no delight in the means that lead to God, there
is no delight in God himself; because love is appetitus unionis, a desire of union; and where the object is
desirable, the means that brings us to it would be delightful too.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) In calling upon God only in a time of necessity. How officious will men be in affliction, to that
God whom they neglect in their prosperity! “When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned
and inquired after God, and they remembered that God was their rock” (Psalm 78:34). They remembered
him under the scourge, and forgot him under his smiles: they visit the throne of grace, knock loud at
heaven’s gates, and give God no rest for their early and importunate devotions when under distress: but
when their desires are answered, and the rod removed, they stand aloof from him, and rest upon their own
bottom, as Jer. 2:31: “We are lords; we will come no more unto thee.” When we have need of him, he
shall find us clients at his gate; and when we have served our turn, he hears no more of us: like Noah’s
dove sent out of the ark, that returned to him when she found no rest on the earth, but came not back when
she found a footing elsewhere. How often do men apply themselves to God, when they have some
business for him to do for them! And then too, they are loth to put it solely into his hand to manage it for
his own honor; but they presume to be his directors, that he may manage it for their glory. Self spurs men
onto the throne of grace; they desire to be furnished with some mercy they want, or to have the clouds of
some judgments which they fear blown over: this is not affection to God, but to ourselves: as the Romans
worshipped a quartan ague as a goddess, and Timorem and Pallorem, fear and paleness, as gods; not out
of any affection they had to the disease or the passion, but for fear to receive any hurt by them. Again,
when we have gained the mercy we need, how little do we warm our souls with the consideration of that
God that gave it, or lay out the mercy in his service! We are importunate to have him our friend in our
necessities, and are ungratefully careless of him, and his injuries he sufers by us or others. When he hath
discharged us from the rock where we stuck, we leave him, as having no more need of him, and able to do
well enough without him; as if we were petty gods ourselves, and only wanted a lift from him at first.
This is not to glorify God as God, but as our servant; not an honoring of God, but a self-seeking: he would
hardly beg at God’s door, if he could pleasure himself without him.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) In begging his assistance to our own projects. When we lay the plot of our own affairs, and then
come to God, not for counsel but blessing, self only shall give us counsel how to act; but because we
believe there is a God that governs the world, we will desire him to contribute success. God is not
consulted with till the counsel of self be fixed; then God must be the executor of our will. Self must be the
principal, and God the instrument to hatch what we have contrived. It is worse when we beg of God to
favor some sinful aim; the Psalmist implies this (Psalm 66:18): “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord
will not hear me.” Iniquity regarded as the aim in prayer, renders the prayer successless, and the suppliant
an atheist, in debasing God to back his lust by his holy providence. The disciples had determined revenge;
and because they could not act it without their Master, they would have him be their second in their
vindictive passion (Luke 9:55): “Call for fire from heaven.” We scarce seek God till we have modelled
the whole contrivance in our own brains, and resolved upon the methods of performance; as though there
were not a fulness of wisdom in God to guide us in our resolves, as well as power to breathe success upon
them.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) In impatience upon the refusal of our desires. How often do men’s spirits rise against God, when
he steps not in with the assistance they want! If the glory of God swayed more with them than their
private interest, they would let God be judge of his own glory, and rather magnify his wisdom than
complain of his want of goodness. Selfish hearts wild charge God with neglect of them, if he be not as
quick in their supplies as they are in their desires; like those in Isa. 58:3, “Wherefore have we fasted, say
they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our souls, and thou takest no knowledge?” When we
aim at God’s glory in our importunities, we shall fall down in humble submissions when he denies us;
whereas self riseth up in bold expostulations, as if God were our servant, and had neglected the service he
owed us, not to come at our call. We over-value the satisfactions of self above the honor of God. Besides,
if what we desire be a sin, our impatience at a refusal is more intolerable: it is an anger, that God will not
lay aside his holiness to serve our corruption.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) In the actual aims men have in their duties. In prayer for temporal things, when we desire health
for our own ease, wealth for our own sensuality, strength for our revenge, children for the increase of our
family, gifts for our applause; as Simon Magus did the Holy Ghost: or, when some of those ends are
aimed at, this is to desire God not to serve himself of us, but to be a servant to our worldly interest, our
vain glory, the greatening of our names, &amp;c. In spiritual mercies begged for; when pardon of sin is desired
only for our own security from eternal vengeance; sanctification desired only to make us fit for
everlasting blessedness; peace of conscience, only that we may lead our lives more comfortably in the
world; when we have not actual intentions for the glory of God, or when our thoughts of God’s honor are
overtopped by the aims of self-advantage: not but that as God hath pressed us to those things by motives
drawn from the blessedness derived to ourselves by them, so we may desire them with a respect to
ourselves; but this respect must be contained within the due banks, in subordination to the glory of God,
not above it, nor in an equal balance with it.272 That which is nourishing or medicinal in the first or second
degree, is in the fourth or fifth degree mere destructive poison. Let us consider it seriously; though a duty
be heavenly, doth not some base end smut us in it? [1.] How is it with our confessions of sin? Are they
not more to procure our pardon, than to shame ourselves before God, or to be freed from the chains that
hinder us from bringing him the glory for which we were created; or more to partake of his benefits, than
to honor him in acknowledging the rights of his justice? Do we not bewail sin as it hath ruined us, not as it
opposed the holiness of God? Do we not shuffle with God, and confess one sin, while we reserve another;
as if we would allure God by declaring our dislike of one, to give us liberty to commit wantonness with
another; not to abhor ourselves, but to daub with God. [2.] Is it any better in our private and family
worship? Are not such assemblies frequented by some, where some upon whom they have a dependence
may eye them, and have a better opinion of them, and affection to them? If God were the sole end of our
hearts, would they not be as glowing under the sole eye of God, as our tongues or carriages are seemingly
serious under the eye of man? Are not family duties performed by some that their voices may be heard,
and their reputation supported among godly neighbors? [3.] Is not the charity of many men tainted with
this end—self,273 as the Pharisees were, while they set the miserable object before them, but not the Lord;
bestowing alms not so much upon the necessities of the people, as the friendship we owe them for some
particular respects; or casting our bread upon those waters which stream down in the sight of the world,
that our doles may be visible to them, and commended by them; or when we think to oblige God to
pardon our transgressions, as if we merited it and heaven too at his hands, by bestowing a few pence upon
indigent persons? And [4.] Is it not the same with the reproofs of men? Is not heat and anger carried out
with full sail when our worldly interest is prejudiced and becalmed in the concerns of God? Do not many
masters reprove their servants with more vehemency for the neglect of their trade and business, than the
neglect of divine duties; and that upon religious arguments, pretending the honor of God that they may
mind their own interest? But when they are negligent in what they owe to God, no noise is made, they
pass without rebuke; is not this to make God and religion a stale to their own ends? It is a part of atheism
not to regard the injuries done to God, as Tiberius,274 “Let God’s wrongs be looked to or cared for by
himself.” [5.] Is it not thus in our seeming zeal for religion? as Demetrius and the craftsmen at Ephesus
cried up aloud the greatness of Diana of the Ephesians, not out of any true zeal they had for her, but their
gain, which was increased by the confluence of her worshippers, and the sale of her own shrines (Acts
19:24, 28).
</p>
<p>
    4. In making use of the name of God to countenance our sin. When we set up an opinion that is a
friend to our lusts, and then dig deep into the Scripture to find crutches to support it, and authorize our
practices; when men will thank God for what they have got by unlawful means, fathering the fruit of their
cheating craft, and the simplicity of their chapmen upon God; crediting their cozenage by his name, as
men do brass money, with a thin plate of silver, and the stamp and image of the prince. The Jews urge the
law of God for the crucifying his Son (John 19:7): “We have a law, and by that law he is to die,” and
would make him a party in their private revenge. Thus often when we have faltered in some actions, we
wipe our mouths, as if we sought God more than our own interest, prostituting the sacred name and honor
of God, either to hatch or defend some unworthy lust against his word.275 Is not all this a high degree of
atheism?
</p>
<p>
     1. It is a vilifying God, an abuse of the highest good. Other sins subject the creature and outward
things to them, but acting in religious services for self, subjects not only the highest concernments of
men’s souls, but the Creator himself to the creature, nay, to make God contribute to that which is the
pleasure of the devil, a greater slight than to cast the gifts of a prince to a herd of nasty swine. It were
more excusable to serve ourselves of God upon the higher accounts, such that materially conduce to his
glory; but it is an intolerable wrong to make him and his ordinances caterers for our own bellies, as they
did:276 they sacrificed the ‫ נדכות‬of which the offerer might eat, not out of any reference to God, but love to
their gluttony; not to please him, but feast themselves. The belly was truly made the god, when God was
served only in order to the belly; as though the blessed God had his being, and his ordinances were
enjoined to pleasure their foolish and wanton appetites; as though the work of God were only to patronize
unrighteous ends, and be as bad as themselves, and become a pander to their corrupt affections.
</p>
<p>
     2. Because it is a vilifying of God, it is an undeifying or dethroning God. It is an acting as if we were
the lords, and God our vassal; a setting up those secular ends in the place of God, who ought to be our
ultimate end in every action; to whom a glory is as due, as his mercy to us is utterly unmerited by us. He
that thinks to cheat and put the fool upon God by his pretences, doth not heartily believe there is such a
being. He could not have the notion of a God, without that of omniscience and justice; an eye to see the
cheat, and an arm to punish it. The notion of the one would direct him in the manner of his services, and
the sense of the other would scare him from the cherishing his unworthy ends. He that serves God with a
sole respect to himself, is prepared for any idolatry; his religion shall warp with the times and his interest;
he shall deny the true God for an idol, when his worldly interest shall advise him to it, and pay the same
reverence to the basest image, which he pretends now to pay to God; as the Israelites were as real for
idolatry under their basest princes, as they were pretenders to the true religion under those that were
pious. Before I come to the use of this, give me leave to evince this practical atheism by two other
considerations.
</p>
<p>
     1. Unworthy imaginations of God. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God:” that is, he is not
such a God as you report him to be; this is meant by their being “corrupt,” in the second verse, corrupt
being taken for playing the idolaters (Exod. 32:7). We cannot comprehend God; if we could, we should
cease to be finite; and because we cannot comprehend him, we erect strange images of him in our fancies
and affections. And since guilt came upon us, because we cannot root out the notions of God, we would
debase the majesty and nature of God, that we may have some ease in our consciences, and lie down with
some comfort in the sparks of our own kindling. This is universal in men by nature. “God is not in all his
thoughts;”277 not in any of his thoughts, according the excellency of his nature and greatness of his
majesty. As the heathen did not glorify God as God, so neither do they conceive of God as God; they are
all infected with some one or other ill opinion of him, thinking him not so holy, powerful, just, good, as
he is, and as the natural force of the human understanding might arrive to. We join a new notion of God in
our vain fancies, and represent him not as he is, but as we would have him to be, fit for our own use, and
suited to our own pleasure. We set that active power of imagination on work, and there comes out a god (a
calf) whom we own for a notion of God. Adam cast him into so narrow a mould, as to think that himself,
who had newly sprouted up by his almighty power, was fit to be his corrival in knowledge, and had vain
hopes to grasp as much as infiniteness; if he, in his first declining, begun to have such a conceit, it is no
doubt but we have as bad under a mass of corruption. When holy Agur speaks of God, he cries out that he
had not “the understanding of a man, nor the knowledge of the holy;”278 he did not think rationally of
God, as man might by his strength at his first creation. There are as many carved images of God as there
are minds of men, and as monstrous shapes as those corruptions into which they would transform him.
Hence sprang,
</p>
<p>
     1. Idolatry. Vain imaginations first set afloat and kept up this in the world. Vain imaginations of the
God “whose glory they changed into the image of corruptible man.”279 They had set up vain images of
him in their fancy, before they set up idolatrous representations of him in their temples; the likening him
to those idols of wood and stone, and various metals, were the fruit of an idea erected in their own minds.
This is a mighty debasing the Divine nature, and rendering him no better than that base and stupid matter
they make the visible object of their adoration; equalling him with those base creatures they think worthy
to be the representations of him. Yet how far did this crime spread itself in all corners of the world, not
only among the more barbarous and ignorant, but the more polished and civilized nations! Judea only,
where God had placed the ark of his presence, being free from it, in some intervals of time only after
some sweeping judgment. And though they vomited up their idols under some sharp scourge, they licked
them up again after the heavens were cleared over their heads: the whole book of Judges makes mention
of it. And though an evangelical light hath chased that idolatry away from a great part of the world, yet
the principle remaining coins more spiritual idols in the heart, which are brought before God in acts of
worship.
</p>
<p>
     2. Hence all superstition received its rise and growth. When we mint a god according to our own
complexion, like to us in mutable and various passions, soon angry and soon appeased, it is no wonder
that we invent ways of pleasing him after we have offended him, and think to expiate the sin of our souls
by some melancholy devotions and self-chastisements. Superstition is nothing else but an unscriptural and
unrevealed dread of God.280 When they imagined him a rigorous and severe master, they cast about for
ways to mitigate him whom they thought so hard to be pleased: a very mean thought of him, as if a slight
and pompous devotion could as easily bribe and flatter him out of his rigors, as a few good words or
baubling rattles could please and quiet little children; and whatsoever pleased us, could please a God
infinitel above us. Such narrow conceits had the Philistines, when they thought to still the anger of the
God of Israel, whom they thought they possessed in the ark, with the present of a few golden mice.281 All
the superstition this day living in the world is built upon this foundation: so natural it is to man to pull
God down to his own imaginations, rather than raise his imaginations up to God. Hence doth arise also
the diffidence of his mercy, though they repent; measuring God by the contracted models of their own
spirits; as though his nature were as difficult to pardon their offences against him, as they are to remit
wrongs done to themselves.
</p>
<p>
     3. Hence springs all presumption, the common disease of the world. All the wickedness in the world,
which is nothing else but presuming upon God, rises from the ill interpretations of the goodness of God,
breaking out upon them in the works of creation and providence. The corruption of man’s nature
engendered by those notions of goodness a monstrous birth of vain imaginations; not of themselves
primarily, but of God; whence arose all that folly and darkness in their minds and conversations (Rom.
1:20, 21). They glorified him not as God, but, according to themselves, imagined him good that
themselves might be bad; fancied him so indulgent, as to neglect his own honor for their sensuality. How
doth the unclean person represent him to his own thoughts, but as a goat; the murderer as a tiger; the
sensual person as a swine; while they fancy a God indulgent to their crimes without their repentance! As
the image on the seal is stamped upon the wax, so the thoughts of the heart are printed upon the actions.
God’s patience is apprehended to be an approbation of their vices, and from the consideration of his
forbearance, they fashion a god that they believe will smile upon their crimes. They imagine a god that
plays with them; and though he threatens doth it only to scare, but means not as he speaks. A god they
fancy like themselves, that would do as they would do, not be angry for what they count a light offence
(Psalm 50:21): “Thou thoughtest I was such a one as thyself;” that God and they were exactly alike as two
tallies. “Our wilful misapprehensions of God are the cause of our misbehavior in all his worship. Our
slovenly and lazy services tell him to his face what slight thoughts and apprehensions we have of him.”282
Compare these two together. Superstition ariseth from terrifying misapprehensions of God: presumption
from self pleasing thoughts. One represents him only rigorous, and the other careless. One makes us over-
officious in serving him by our own rules; and the other over-bold in offending him according to our
humors. The want of a true notion of God’s justice makes some men slight him; and the want of a true
apprehension of his goodness makes others too servile in their approaches to him. One makes us careless
of duties, and the other makes us look on them rather as physic than food; an unsupportable penance, than
a desirable privilege. In this case hell is the principle of duty performed to heaven. The superstitious man
believes God hath scarce mercy to pardon; the presumptuous man believes he hath no such perfection as
justice to punish. The one makes him insignificant to what he desires, kindness and goodness; the other
renders him insignificant to what he fears, his vindictive justice. What between the idolater, the
superstitious, the presumptuous person, God should look like no God in the world. These unworthy
imaginations of God are likewise,
</p>
<p>
     2. A vilifying of him. Debasing the Creator to be a creature of their own fancies; putting their own
stamp upon him; and fashioning him not according to that beautiful image he impressed upon them by
creation; but the defaced image they inherit by their fall, and which is worse, the image of the devil which
spread itself over them at their revolt and apostasy. Were it possible to see a picture of God, according to
the fancies of men, it would be the most monstrous being, such a God that never was, nor ever can be. We
honor God when we have worthy opinions of him suitable to his nature; when we conceive of him as a
being of unbounded loveliness and perfection. We detract from him when we ascribe to him such qualities
as would be a horrible disgrace to a wise and good man as injustice and impurity. Thus men debase God
when they invert his order, and would create him according to their image, as he first created them
according to his own; and think him not worthy to be a God, unless he fully answer the mould they would
cast him into, and be what is unworthy of his nature. Men do not conceive of God as he would have them;
but he must be what they would have him, one of their own shaping.
</p>
<p>
     1. This is worse than idolatry. The grossest idolater commits not a crime so heinous, by changing his
glory into the image of creeping things and senseless creatures, as the imagining God to be as one of our
sinful selves, and likening him to those filthy images we erect in our fancies. One makes him an earthly
God, like an earthly creature; the other fancies him an unjust and impure God, like a wicked creature. One
sets up an image of him in the earth, which is his footstool; the other sets up an image of him in the heart,
which ought to be his throne.
</p>
<p>
     2. It is worse than absolute atheism, or a denial of God. “Dignius credimus non esse, quodcunque non
ita fuerit, ut esse deberet,”283 was the opinion of Tertullian. It is more commendable to think him not to
be, than to think him such a one as is inconsistent with his nature. Better to deny his existence, than deny
his perfection. No wise man but would rather have his memory rot, than be accounted infamous, and
would be more obliged to him that should deny that ever he had a being in the world, than to say he did
indeed live, but he was a sot, a debauched person, and a man not to be trusted. When we apprehend God
deceitful in his promises, unrighteous in his threatenmgs, unwilling to pardon upon repentance, or
resolved to pardon notwithstanding impenitency: these are things either unworthy of the nature of God, or
contrary to that revelation he hath given of himself. Better for a man never to have been born than be
forever miserable; so better to be thought no God, than represented impotent or negligent, unjust or
deceitful; which are more contrary to the nature of God than hell can be to the greatest criminal. In this
sense perhaps the apostle affirms the Gentiles (Eph. 2:12) to be such as are “without God in the world;” as
being more atheists in adoring God under such notions as they commonly did, than if they had
acknowledged no God at all.
</p>
<p>
    3. This is evident by our natural desire to be distant from him, and unwillingness to have any
acquaintance with him. Sin set us first at a distance from God; and every new act of gross sin estrangeth
us more from him, and indisposeth us more for him: it makes us both afraid and ashamed to be near him.
Sensual men were of this frame that Job discourseth of (ch. 21:7–9, 14, 15). Where grace reigns, the
nearer to God the more vigorous the motion; the nearer anything approaches to us, that is the object of our
desires, the more eagerly do we press forward to it: but our blood riseth at the approaches of anything to
which we have an aversion. We have naturally a loathing of God’s coming to us or our return to him: we
seek not after him as our happiness; and when he offers himself, we like it not, but put a disgrace upon
him in choosing other things before him. God and we are naturally at as great a distance, as light and
darkness, life and death, heaven and hell. The stronger impression of God anything hath, the more we fly
from it. The glory of God in reflection upon Moses’ face scared the Israelites; they. who had desired God
to speak to them by Moses, when they saw a signal impression of God upon his countenance, were afraid
to come near him, as they were before unwilling to come near to God.284 Not that the blessed God is in his
own nature a frightful object; but our own guilt renders him so to us, and ourselves indisposed to converse
with him; as the light of the sun is as irksome to a distempered eye, as it is in its own nature desirable to a
sound one. The saints themselves have had so much frailty, that they have cried out, that they were
undone, if they had any more than ordinary discoveries of God made unto them; as if they wished him
more remote from them. Vileness cannot endure the splendor of majesty, nor guilt the glory of a judge.
</p>
<p>
    We have naturally, 1. No desire of remembrance of him, 2. Or converse with him, 3. Or thorough
return to him, 4. Or close imitation of him: as if there were not any such being as God in the world; or as
if we wished there were none at all; so feeble and spiritless are our thoughts of the being of a God.
</p>
<p>
    1. No desire for the remembrance of him. How delightful are other things in our minds! How
burdensome the memorials of God, from whom we have our being! With what pleasure do we
contemplate the nature of creatures, even of flies and toads, while our minds tire in the search of Him,
who hath bestowed upon us our knowing and meditating faculties! Though God shows himself to us in
every creature, in the meanest weed as well as the highest heavens, and is more apparent in them to our
reasons than themselves can be to our sense; yet though we see them, we will not behold God in them: we
will view them to please our sense, to improve our reason in their natural perfections; but pass by the
consideration of God’s perfections so visibly beaming from them. Thus we play the beasts and atheists in
the very exercise of reason, and neglect our Creator to gratify our sense, as though the pleasure of that
were more desirable than the knowledge of God. The desire of our souls is not towards his name and the
remembrance of him,285 when we set not ourselves in a posture to feast our souls with deep and serious
meditations of him; have a thought of him, only by the bye and away, as if we were afraid of too intimate
acquaantance with him. Are not the thoughts of God rather our invaders than our guests; seldom invited to
reside and take up their home in our hearts? Have we not, when they have broke in upon us, bid them
depart from us,286 and warned them to come no more upon our ground; sent them packing as soon as we
could, and were glad when they were gone? And when they have departed, have we not often been afraid
they, should return again upon us, and therefore looked about for other inmates, things not good, or if
good, infinitely below God, to possess the room of our hearts before any thoughts of him should appear
again? Have we not often been glad of excuses to shake off resent thoughts of him, and when we have
wanted real ones, found out pretences to keep God and our hearts at a distance? Is not this a part of
atheism, to be so unwilling to employ our faculties about the giver of them, to refuse to exercise them in a
way of a grateful remembrance of him; as though they were none of his gift, but our own acquisition; as
though the God that truly gave them had no right to them, and he that thinks on us every day in a way of
providence, were not worthy, to be thought on by us in a way of special remembrance? Do not the best,
that love the remembrance of him, and abhor this natural averseness, find, that when they would think of
God, many things tempt them and turn them to think elsewhere? Do they not find their apprehensions too
feeble, their motions too dull, and the impressions too slight? This natural atheism is spread over human
nature.
</p>
<p>
    2. No desire of converse with him. The word “remember” in the command for keeping holy the
Sabhath-day, including all the duties of the day, and the choicest of our lives, implies our natural
unwillingness to them, and forgetfulness of them. God’s pressing this command with more reasons than
the rest, manifests that man hath no heart for spiritual duties. No spiritual duty, which sets us immediately
face to face with God, but in the attempts of it we find naturally a resistance from some powerful
principle; so that every one may subscribe to the speech of the apostle, that “when we would do good, evil
is present with them.” No reason of this can be rendered, but the natural temper of our souls, and an
affecting a distance from God under any consideration: for though our guilt first made the breach, yet this
aversion to a converse with him steps up without any actual reflections apon our guilt, which may render
God terrible to us as an offended judge. Are we not often also, in our attendance upon him, more pleased
with the modes of worship which gratify our fancy, than to have our souls inwardly delighted with the
object of worship himself? This is a part of our natural atheism. To cast such duties off by total neglect, or
in part, by affecting a coldness in them, is to cast off the fear of the Lord.287 Not to call upon God, and not
to know him, are one and. the same thing (Jer. 10:25). Either we think there is no such Being in the world,
or that he is so slight a one, that he deserves not the respect he calls for; or so impotent and poor, that he
cannot supply what our necessities require.
</p>
<p>
    3. No desire of a thorough return to him. The first man fled from him after his defection, though he
had no refuge to fly to but the grace of his Creator. Cain went from his presence, would be a fugitive from
God rather than a suppliant to him; when by faith in, and application of the promised Redeemer, he might
have escaped the wrath to come for his brother’s blood, and mitigated the sorrows he was justly sentenced
to bear in the world. Nothing will separate prodigal man from commoning with swine; and make him
return to his father, but an empty trough: have we but husks to feed on, we shall never think of a father’s
presence. It were well if our sores and indigence would drive us to him; but when our strength is
devoured, we will not “return to the Lord our God, nor seek him for all this.”288 Not his drawn sword, as a
God of judgment, nor his mighty power, as a Lord, nor his open arms, as the Lord their God, could move
them to turn their eyes and their hearts towards him. The more he invites us to partake of his grace, the
further we run from him to provoke his wrath: the louder God called them by his prophets, the closer they
stuck to their Baal.289 We turn our backs when he stretches out his hand, stop our ears when he lifts up his
voice. We fly from him when he courts us, and shelter ourselves in any bush from his merciful hand that
would lay hold upon us; nor will we set our faces towards him, till our way be hedged up with thorns, and
not a gap left to creep out any by-way.290 Whosoever is brought to a return, puts the Holy Ghost to the
pain of striving; he is not easily brought to a spiritual subjection to God, nor persuaded to a surrender at a
summons, but sweetly overpowered by storm, and victoriously drawn into the arms of God. God stands
ready, but the heart stands off; grace is full of entreaties, and the soul full of excuses; Divine love offers,
and carnal selflove rejects. Nothing so pleases us as when we are farthest from him; as if anything were
more amiable, anything more desirable, than himself.
</p>
<p>
    4. No desire of any close imitation of him. When our Saviour was to come as a refiner’s fire, to purify
the sons of Levi, the cry, is, “Who shall abide the day of his coming?” (Mal. 3:2, 3.) Since we are
alienated from the life of God, we desire no more naturally to live the life of God, than a toad, or any
other animal, desires to live the life of a man. No heart that knows God but hath a holy ambition to imitate
him. No soul that refuseth him for a copy, but is ignorant of his excellency. Of this temper is all mankind
naturally, Man in corruption is as loth to be like God in holiness, as Adam, after his creation, was desirous
to be like God in knowledge; his posterity are like their father, who soon turned his back upon his original
copy. What can be worse than this? Can the denial of his being be a greater injury than this contempt of
him; as if he had not goodness to deserve our, remembrance, nor amiableness fit for our converse; as if he
were not a Lord fit for our subjection, nor had a holiness that deserved our imitation? For the use of
this:—
</p>
<p>
    Use I. It serves for information.
</p>
<p>
    1: It gives us occasion to admire the wonderful patience and mercy of God. How many millions of
practical atheists breathe every day in his air, and live upon his bounty who deserve to be inhabitants in
hell, rather than possessors of the earth! An infinite holiness is offended, an infinite justice is provoked;
yet an infinite patience forbears the punishment, and an infinite goodness relieves our wants: the more we
had merited his justice and forfeited his favor, the more is his affection enhanced, which makes his hand
so liberal to us. At the first invasion of his rights, he mitigates the terror of the threatening which was set
to defend his law, with the grace of a promise to relieve and recover his rebellious creature.291 Who would
have looked for anything but tearing thunders, sweeping judgments, to raze up the foundations of the
apostate world? But oh, how great are his bowels to his aspiring competitors! Have we not exerimented
his contrivances for our good, though we have refused him for our happiness? Has he not opened his
arms, when we spurned with our feet; held out his alluring mercy, when we have brandished against him a
rebellious sword? Has he not entreated us while we have invaded him, as if he were unwilling to lose us,
who are ambitious to destroy ourselves? Has he yet denied us the care of his providence, while we have
denied him the rights of his honor, and would appropriate them to ourselves? Has the sun forborne
shining upon us, though we have shot our arrows against him? Have not our beings been supported by his
goodness, while we have endeavored to climb up to his throne; and his mercies continued to charm us,
while we have used them as weapons to injure him? Our own necessities might excite us to own him as
our happiness, but he adds his invitations to the voice of our wants. Has he not promised a kingdom to
those that would strip him or his crown, and proclaimed pardon upon repentance to those that would take
away his glory? and hath so twisted together his own end, which is his honor, and man’s true end, which
is his salvation, that a man cannot truly mind himself and his own salvation, but he must mind God’s
glory; and cannot be intent upon God’s honor, but by the same act he promotes himself and his own
happiness? so loth is God to give any just occasion of dissatisfaction to his creature, as well as dishonor to
himself. All those wonders of his mercy are enhanced by the heinousness of our atheism; a multitude of
gracious thoughts from him above the multitude of contempts from us.292 What rebels in actual arms
against their prince, aiming at his life, ever found that favor from him; to have all their necessaries richly
afforded them, without which they would starve, and without which. they would be unable to manage
their attempts, as we have received from God? Had not God had riches of goodness, forbearance, and
long-suffering, and infinite riches too, the despite the world had done him, in refusing him as their rule,
happiness, and end, would have emptied him long ago.293
</p>
<p>
    2. It brings in a justification of the exercise of his justice. If it gives us occasion loudly to praise his
patience, it also stops our mouths from accusing any acts of his vengeance. What can be too sharp a
recompense for the despising and disgracing so great a Being? The highest contempt merits the greatest
anger; and when we will not own him for our happiness, it is equal we should feel the misery of
separation from him. If he that is guilty of treason deserves to lose his life, what punishment can be
thought great enough for him that is so disingenuous as to prefer himself before a God so infinitely good,
and so foolish as to invade the rights of one infinitely powerful? It is no injustice for a creature to be
forever left to himself, to see what advantage he can make of that self he was so busily employed to set up
in the place of his Creator. The soul of man deserves an infinite punishment for despising an infinite
good; and it is not unequitable, that that self which man makes his rule and happiness above God, should
become his torment and misery by the righteousness of that God whom he despised.
</p>
<p>
     3. Hence ariseth a necessity of a new state and frame of soul, to alter an atheistical nature. We forget
God; think of him with reluctancy; have no respect to God in our course and acts: this cannot be our
original state. God, being infinitely good, never let man come out of his hands with this actual
unwillingness to acknowledge and serve him; he never intended to dethrone himself for the work of his
hands, or that the creature should have any other end than that of his Creator: as the apostle saith, in the
case of the Galatians’ error (Gal. 5:8), “This persuasion came not of Him that called you;” so this frame
comes not from him that created you: how much, therefore, do we need a restoring principle in us! Instead
of ordering ourselves according to the will of God, we are desirous to “fulfil the wills of the flesh:”294
there is a necessity of some other principle in us to make us fulfil the will of God, since we were created
for God, not for the flesh. We can no more be voluntarily serviceable to God, while our serpentine nature
and devilish habits remain in us, than we can suppose the devil can be willing to glorify God, while the
nature he contracted by his fall abides powerfully in him. Our nature and will must be changed, that our
actions may regard God as our end, that we may delightfully meditate on him, and draw the motives of
our obedience from him. Since this atheism is seated in nature, the change must be in our nature; since our
first aspirings to the rights of God were the fruits of the serpent’s breath which tainted our nature, there
must be a removal of this taint, whereby our natures may be on the side of God against Satan, as they
were before on the side of Satan against God. There must be a supernatural principle before we can live a
supernatural life, i. e. live to God, since we are naturally alienated from the life of God: the aversion of
our natures from God, is as strong as our inclination to evil; we are disgusted with one, and pressed with
the other; we have no will, no heart, to come to God in any service. This nature must be broken in pieces
and new moulded, before we can make God our rule and our end: while men’s “deeds are evil” they
cannot comply with God; O much less while their natures are evil till this be done, all the service a man
performs riseth from some “evil imagination of the heart, which is evil, only evil, and that continually;”295
from wrong notions of God, wrong notions of duty, or corrupt motives. All the pretences of devotion to
God are but the adoration of some golden image. Prayers to God for the ends of self are like those of the
devil to our Saviour, when he asked leave to go into the herd of swine: the object was right, Christ; the
end was the destruction of the swine, and the satisfaction of their malice to the owners; there is a necessity
then that depraved ends should be removed, that that which was God’s end in our framing, may be our
end in our acting, viz. his glory, which cannot be without a change of nature. We can never honor him
supremely whom we do not supremely love; till this be, we cannot glorify God as God, though we do
things by his command and order; no more, than when God employed the devil in afflicting Job.296 His
performance cannot be said to be good, because his end was not the same with God’s; he acted out of
malice, what God commanded out of sovereignty, and for gracious designs; had God employed an holy
angel in his design upon Job, the action had been good in the affliction, because his nature was holy, and
therefore his ends holy; but bad in the devil, because his ends were base and unworthy.

<p>
     4. We may gather from hence, the difficulty of conversion, and mortification to follow thereupon.
What is the reason men receive no more impression from the voice of God and the light of his truth, than
a dead man in the grave doth from the roaring thunder, or a blind mole from the light of the sun? It is
because our atheism is as great as the deadness of the one, or the blindness of the other. The principle in
the heart is strong to shut the door both of the thoughts and affections against God. If a friend oblige us,
we shall act for him as for ourselves; we are won by entreaties; soft words overcome us; but our hearts are
as deaf as the hardest rock at the call of God; neither the joys of heaven proposed by him can allure us,
nor the flashed terrors of hell affright us to him, as if we conceived God unable to bestow the one or
execute the other: the true reason is, God and self contest for the deity. The law of sin is, God must be at
the footstool; the law of God is, sin must be utterly deposed. Now it is difficult to leave a law beloved for
a law long ago discarded. The mind of man will hunt after anything; the will of man embrace anything:
upon the proposal of mean objects the spirit of man spreads its wings, flies to catch them, becomes one
with them but attempt to bring it under the power of God, the wings flag, the creature looks lifeless, as
though there were no spring of motion in it; it is as much crucified to God, as the holy apostle was to the
world. The sin of the heart discovers its strength the more God discovers the “holiness of his will.”297 The
love of sin hath been predominant in our nature, has quashed a love to God, if not extinguished it. Hence
also is the difficulty of mortification. This is a work tending to the honor of God, the abasing of that
inordinately aspiring humor in ourselves. If the nature of man be inclined to sin, as it is, it must needs be
bent against anything that opposes it. It is impossible to strike any true blow at any lust till the true sense
of God be re-entertained in the soil where it ought to grow. Who can be naturally willing to crucify what
is incorporated with him—his flesh? what is dearest to him—himself? Is it an easy thing for man, the
competitor with God, to turn his arms against himself, that self should overthrow its own empire, lay
aside all its pretensions to, and designs for, a godhead; to hew off its own members, and subdue its own
affections? It is the nature of man to “cover his sin,” to hide it in his bosom,298 not to destroy it; and as
unwillingly part with his carnal affections, as the legion of devils were with the man that had been long
possessed;. and when he is forced and fired from one, he will endeavor to espouse some other lust, as
those devils desired to possess swine, when they were chased from their possession of that man.
</p>
<p>
     5. Here we see the reason of unbelief. That which hath most of God in it, meets with most aversion
from us; that which hath least of God, finds better and stronger inclinations in us. What is the reason that
the heart of man is more unwilling to embrace the gospel, than acknowledge the equity of the law?
because there is more of God’s nature and perfection evident in the gospel than in the law; besides, there
is more reliance on God, and distance from self, commanded in the gospel. The law puts a man upon his
own strength, the gospel takes him off from his own bottom; the law acknowleges him to have a power in
himself, and to act for his own reward; the gospel strips him of all his proud and towering thoughts,299
brings him to his due place, the foot of God; orders him to deny himself as his own rule, righteousness,
and end, “and henceforth not to live to himself.”300 This is the true reason why men are more against the
gospel than against the law; because it doth more deify God, and debase man. Hence it is easier to reduce
men to some moral virtue than to faith; to make men blush at their outward vices, but not at the inward
impurity of their natures. Hence it is observed, that those that asserted that all happiness did arise from
something in a man’s self, as the Stoics and Epicureans did, and that a wise man was equal with God,
were greater enemies to the truths of the gospel than others (Acts 17:18), because it lays the axe to the
root of their principal opinion, takes the one from their self-sufficiency, and the other from their self-
gratification; it opposeth the brutish principle of the one, which placed happiness in the pleasures of the
body, and the more noble principle of the other, which placed happiness in the virtue of the mind; the one
was for a sensual, the other for a moral self; both disowned by the doctrine of the gospel.
</p>
<p>
     6. It informs us, consequently, who can be the Author of grace and conversion, and every other good
work. No practical atheist ever yet turned to God, but was turned by God; and not to acknowledge it to
God is a part of this atheism, since it is a robbing God of the honor of one of his most glorious works. If
this practical atheism be natural to man ever since the first taint of nature in Paradise, what can be
expected from it, but a resisting of the work of God, and setting up all the forces of nature against the
operations of grace, till a day of power dawn and clear up upon the soul?301 Not all the angels in heaven,
or men upon earth, can be imagined to be able to persuade a man to fall out with himself; nothing can turn
the tide of nature, but a power above nature. God took away the sanctifying Spirit from man, as a penalty
for the first sin; who can regain it but by his will and pleasure? who can restore it, but he that removed it?
Since every man hath the same fundamental atheism in him by nature, and would be a rule to himself and
his own end, he is so far from dethroning himself, that all the strength of his corrupted nature is alarmed
up to stand to their arms upon any attempt God makes to regain the fort. The will is so strong against God,
that it is like many wills twisted together (Eph. 2:3), “Wills of the flesh;” we translate it the “desires of the
flesh;” like many threads twisted in a cable, never to be snapped asunder by a human arm; a power and
will above ours, can only untwist so many wills in a knot. Man cannot rise to an acknowledgment of God
without God; hell may as well become heaven, the devil be changed into an angel of light. The devil
cannot but desire happiness; he knows the misery into which he is fallen, he cannot be desirous of that
punishment he knows is reserved for him. Why doth he not sanctify God, and glorify his Creator, wherein
there is abundantly more pleasure than in his malicious course? Why doth he not petition to recover his
ancient standing? he will not; there are chains of darkness upon his faculties; he will not be otherwise than
he is; his desire to be god of the world sways him against his own interest, and out of love to his malice,
he will not sin at a less rate to make a diminution of his punishment. Man, if God utterly refuseth to work
upon him, is no better; and to maintain his atheism would venture a hell. How is it possible for a man to
turn himself to that God against whom he hath a quarrel in his nature; the most rooted and settled habit in
him being to set himself in the place of God? An atheist by nature can no more alter his own temper, and
engrave in himself the divine nature, than a rock can carve itself into the statue of a man, or a serpent that
is an enemy to man could or would raise itself to the nobility of the human nature. That soul that by
nature would strip God of his rights, cannot, without a divine power, be made conformable to him, and
acknowledge sincerely and cordially the rights and glory of God.
</p>
<p>
    7. We may here see the reason why there can be no justification by the best and strongest works of
nature. Can that which hath atheism at the root justify either the action or person? What strength can those
works have which have neither God’s law for their rule, nor his glory for their end? that are not wrought
by any spiritual strength from him, nor tend with any spiritual affection to him? Can these be a foundation
for the most holy God to pronounce a creature righteous? They will justify his justice in condemning, but
cannot sway his justice to an absolution. Every natural man in his works picks and chooses; he owns the
will of God no further than he can wring it to suit the law of his members, and minds not the honor of
God, but as it jostles not with his own glory and secular ends. Can he be righteous that prefers his own
will and his own honor before the will and honor of the Creator? However men’s actions may be
beneficial to others, what reason hath God to esteem them, wherein there is no respect to him, but
themselves; whereby they dethrone him in their thoughts, while they seem to own him in their religious
works? Every day reproves us with something different from the rule; thousands of wanderings offer
themselves to our eyes: can justification be expected from that which in itself is matter of despair?
</p>
<p>
    8. See here the cause of all the apostasy in the world. Practical atheism was never conquered in such;
they are still “alienated from the life of God,” and will not live to God, as he lives to himself and his own
honor.302 They loathe his rule, and distaste his glory; are loth to step out of themselves to promote the
ends of another; find not the satisfaction in him as they do in themselves; they will be judges of what is
good for them and righteous in itself, rather than admit of God to judge for them. When men draw back
from truth to error, it is to such opinions which may serve more to foment and cherish their ambition,
covetousness, or some beloved lust that disputes with God for precedency, and is designed to be served
before him (John 12:42, 43): “They love the praise of men more than the praise of God.” A preferring
man before God was the reason they would not confess Christ, and God in him.
</p>
<p>
    9. This shows us the excellency of the gospel and christian religion. It sets man in his due place, and
gives to God what the excellency of his nature requires. It lays man in the dust from whence he was taken,
and sets God upon that throne where he ought to sit. Man by nature would annihilate God and deify
himself; the gospel glorifies God and annihilates man. In our first revolt we would be like him in
knowledge; in the means he hath provided for our recovery, he designs to make us like him in grace; the
gospel shows ourselves to be an object of humiliation, and God to be a glorious object for our imitation.
The light of nature tells us there is a God; the gospel gives us a more magnificent report of him; the light
of nature condemns gross atheism, and that of the gospel condemns and conquers spiritual atheism in the
hearts of men.
</p>
<p>
     Use II. Of exhortation.
</p>
<p>
     First, Let us labor to be sensible of this atheism in our nature, and be humbled for it. How should we
lie in the dust, and go bowing under the humbling thoughts of it all our days! Shall we not be sensible of
that whereby we spill the blood of our souls, and give a stab to the heart of our own salvation? Shall we
be worse than any creature, not to bewail that which tends to our destruction? He that doth not lament it,
cannot challenge the character of a Christian, hath nothing of the divine life and love planted in his soul.
Not a man but shall one day be sensible, when the eternal God shall call him out to examination, and
charge his conscience to discover every crime, which will then own the authority whereby it acted; when
the heart shall be torn open, and the secrets of it brought to public view; and the world and man himself
shall see what a viperous brood of corrupt principles and ends nested in his heart. Let us, therefore, be
truly sensible of it, till the consideration draw tears from our eyes and sorrow from our souls; let us urge
the thoughts of it upon our hearts till the core of that pride be eaten out, and our stubbornness changed
into humility; till our heads become waters, and our eyes fountains of tears, and be a spring of prayer to
God to change the heart, and mortify the atheism in it; and consider what a sad thing it is to be a practical
atheist: and who is not so by nature?
</p>
<p>
     1. Let us be sensible of it in ourselves. Have any of our hearts been a soil wherein the fear and
reverence of God hath naturally grown? Have we a desire to know him, or a will to embrace him? Do we
delight in his will, and love the remembrance of his name? Are our respects to him, as God, equal to the
speculative knowledge we have of his nature? Is the heart, wherein he hath stamped his image, reserved
for his residence? Is not the world more affected than the Creator of the world; as though that could
contribute to us a greater happiness than the Author of it? Have not creatures as much of our love, fear,
trust, nay, more, than God that framed both them and us? Have we not too often relied upon our own
strength, and made a calf of our own wisdom, and said of God, as the Israelites of Moses, “As for this
Moses we wot not what is become of him?” (Exod. 32:1) and given oftener the glory of our good success
to our drag and our net, to our craft and our industry, than to the wisdom and blessing of God? Are we,
then, free from this sort of atheism?303 It is as impossible to have two Gods at one time in one heart, as to
have two kings at one time in full power in one kingdom. Have there not been frequent neglects of God?
Have we not been deaf whilst he hath knocked at our doors? slept when he hath sounded in our ears, as if
there had been no such being as a God in the world? How many strugglings have been against our
approaches to him! Hath not folly often been committed, with vain imaginations starting up in the time of
religious service, which we would scarce vouchsafe a look to at another time, and in another business, but
would have thrust them away with indignation? Had they stept in to interrupt our worldly affairs, they
would have been troublesome intruders; but while we are with God they are acceptable guests. How
unwilling have our hearts been to fortify themselves with strong and influencing considerations of God,
before we addressed to him! Is it not too often that our lifelessness in prayer proceeds from this atheism; a
neglect of seeing what arguments and pleas may be drawn from the divine perfections, to second our suit
in hand, and quicken our hearts in the service? Whence are those indispositions to any spiritual duty, but
because we have not due thoughts of the majesty, holiness, goodness, and excellency of God? Is there any
duty which leads to a more particular inquiry after him, or a more clear vision of him, but our hearts have
been ready to rise up and call it cursed rather than blessed? Are not our minds bemisted with an ignorance
of him, our wills drawn by aversion from him, our affections rising in distaste of him? more willing to
know anything than his nature, and more industrious to do anything than his will? Do we not all fall under
some one or other of these considerations? Is it not fit, then, that we should have a sense of them? It is to
be bewailed by us, that so little of God is in our hearts, when so many evidences of the love of God are in
the creatures; thikt God should be so little our end, who hath been so much our benefactor; that he should
be so little in our thoughts, who sparkles in everything which presents itself to our eyes.
</p>
<p>
    2. Let us be sensible of it in others. We ought to have a just execration of the too open iniquity in the
midst of us; and imitate holy David, whose tears plentifully gushed out, “because men kept not God’s
law.”304 And is it not a time to exercise this pious lamentation? Hath the wicked atheism of any age been
greater, or can you find worse in hell, than we may hear of and behold on earth? How is the excellent
Maiesty of God adored by the angels in heaven, despised and reproached by men on earth, as if his name
were published to be matter of their sport! What a gasping thing is a natural sense of God among men in
the world! Is not the law of God, accompanied with such dreadful threatenings and curses, made light of,
as if men would place their honor in being above or beyond any sense of that glorious Majesty? How
many wallow in pleasures, as if they had been made men only to turn brutes, and their souls given them
only for salt, to keep their bodies from putrefying? It is as well a part of atheism not to be sensible of the
abuses of God’s name and laws by others, as to violate them ourselves: what is the language of a stupid
senselessness of them, but that there is no God in the world whose glory is worth a vindication, and
deserves our regards? That we may be sensible of the unworthiness of neglecting God as our rule and end,
consider,
</p>
<p>
    1. The unreasonableness of it as it concerns God.
</p>
<p>
    1st. It is a high contempt of God. It is an inverting the order of things; a making God the highest to
become the lowest; and self the lowest to become the highest: to be guided by every base companion,
some idle vanity, some carnal interest, is to acknowledge an excellency abounding in them which is
wanting in God; an equity in their orders, and none in God’s precepts; a goodness in their promises, and a
falsity in God’s; as if infinite excellency were a mere vanity, and to act for God were the debasement of
our reason; to act for self or some pitiful creature, or sordid lust, were the glory and advancement of it. To
prefer any one sin before the onor of God, is as if that sin had been our creator and benefactor, as if it
were the original cause of our being and support. Do not men pay as great a homage to that as they do to
God? Do not their minds eagerly pursue it? Are not the revolvings of it, in their fancies, as delightful to
them as the remembrance of God to a holy soul? Do any obey the commands of God with more readiness
than they do the orders of their base affections? Did Peter leap more readily into the sea to meet his
Master, than many into the jaws of hell to meet their Dalilahs? How cheerfully did the Israelites part with
their ornaments for the sake of an idol, who would not have spared a moiety for the honor of their
Deliverer!305 If to make God our end is the principal duty in nature, then to make ourselves, or anything
else, our end, is the greatest vice in the rank of evils.
</p>
<p>
    2d. It is a contempt of God as the most amiable object. God is infinitely excellent and desirable (Zech.
9:17): “How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!” There is nothing in him but what may
ravish our affections; none that knows him but finds attractives to keep them with him; He hath nothing in
him which can be a proper object of contempt, no defects or shadow of evil; there is infinite excellency to
charm us, and infinite goodness to allure us,—the Author of our being, the Benefactor of our lives. Why
then should man, which is his image, be so base as to slight the beautiful Original which stamped it on
him? He is the most lovely object; therefore to be studied, therefore to be honored, therefore to be
followed. In regard of his perfection he hath the highest right to our thoughts. All other beings were
eminently contained in his essence, and were produced by his infinite power. The creature hath nothing
but what it hath from God. And is it not unworthy to prefer the copy before the original—to fall in love
with a picture, instead of the beauty it represents? The creature which we advance to be our rule and end,
can no more report to us the true amiableness of God, than a few colors mixed and suited together upon a
piece of cloth, can the moral and intellectual loveliness of the soul of man. To contemn God one moment
is more base than if all creatures were contemned by us forever; because the excellency of creatures is, to
God, like that of a drop to the sea, or a spark to the glory of unconceivable millions of suns. As much as
the excellency of God is above our conceptions, so much doth the debasing of him admit of unexpressible
aggravations.
</p>
<p>
     2. Consider the ingratitude in it. That we should resist that God with our hearts who made us the work
of his hands, and count him as nothing, from whom we derive all the good that we are or have. There is
no contempt of man but steps in here to aggravate our slighting of God; because there is no relation one
man can stand in to another, wherein God doth not more highly appear to man. If we abhor the unworthy
carriage of a child to a tender father, a servant to an indulgent master, a man to his obliging friend, why do
men daily act that toward God which they cannot speak of without abhorrency, if acted by another against
man? Is God a being less to be regarded than man, and more worthy of contempt than a creature?—“It
would be strange if a benefactor should live in the same town, in the same house with us, and we never
exchange a word with him; yet this is our case, who have the works of God in our eyes, the oodness of
God in our being, the mercy of God in our daily food”306—yet think so little of him, converse so little
with him, serve everything before him, and prefer everything above him? Whence have we our mercies
but from his hand? Who, besides him, maintains our breath this moment? Would he call for our spirits
this moment, they must depart from us to attend his command. There is not a moment wherein our
unworthy carriage is not aggravated, because there is not a moment wherein he is not our Guardian, and
gives us not tastes of a fresh bounty. And it is no light aggravation of our crime, that we injure him
without whose bounty, in giving us our being, we had not been capable of casting contempt upon him:
that he that hath the greatest stamp of his image, man, should deserve the character of the worst of his
rebels: that he who hath only reason by the gift of God to judge of the equity of the laws of God, should
swell against them as grievous, and the government of the Lawgiver as burdensome. Can it lessen the
crime to use the principle wherein we excel the beasts to the disadvantage of God, who endowed us with
that principle above the beasts?
</p>
<p>
     1. It is a debasing of God beyond what the devil doth at present. He is more excusable in his present
state of acting, than man is in his present refusing God for his rule and end. He strives against a God that
exerciseth upon him a vindictive justice; we debase a God that loads us with his daily mercies. The
despairing devils are excluded from any mercy or divine patience; but we are not only under the long-
suffering of his patience, but the large expressions of his bounty. He would not be governed by him when
he was only his bountiful Creator: we refuse to be guided by him after he hath given us the blessing of
creation from his own hand, and the more obliging blessings of redemption by the hand and blood of his
Son. It cannot be imagined that the devils and the damned should ever make God their end, since he hath
assured them he will not be their happiness; and shut up all his perfections from their experimental notice,
but those of his power to preserve them, and his justice to punish them. They have no grant from God of
ever having a heart to comply with his will, or ever having the honor to be actively employed for his
glory. They have some plea for their present contempt of God, not in regard of his nature, for he is
infinitely amiable, excellent and lovely, but in regard of his administration toward them. But what plea
can man have for his practical atheism, who lives by his power, is sustained by his bounty, and solicited
by his Spirit? What an ungrateful thing is it to put off the nature of man for that of devils, and dishonor
God under mercy, as the devils do under his wrathful anger!
</p>
<p>
     2. It is an ungrateful contempt of God, who cannot be injurious to us. He cannot do us wrong, because
he cannot be unjust (Gen. 18:25): “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” His nature doth as much
abhor unrighteousness, as love a communicative goodness: he never commanded anything but what was
highly conducible to the happiness of man. Infinite goodness can no more injure man than it can dishonor
itself: it lays out itself in additions of kindness, and while we debase him, he continues to benefit us; and
is it not an unparalleled ingratitude to turn our backs upon an object so lovely, an object so loving, in the
midst of varieties of allurements from him? God did create intellectual creatures, angels and men, that he
might communicate more of himself and his own goodness and holiness to man, than creatures of a lower
rank were capable of. What do we do, by rejecting him as our rule and end, but cross, as much as in us
lies, God’s end in our creation, and shut our souls against the communications of those perfections he was
so willing to bestow? We use him as if he intended us the greatest wrong, when it is impossible for him to
do any to any of hiss creatures.
</p>
<p>
     3. Consider the misery which will attend such a temper if it continue predominant. Those that thrust
God away as their happiness and end, can expect no other but to be thrust away by him, as to any relief
and compassion. A distance from God here can look for nothing, but a remoteness from God hereafter.
When the devil, a creature of vast endowments, would advance himself above God, and instruct man to
commit the same sin, he is “cursed above all creatures.”307 When we will not acknowledge him a God of
all glory, we shall be separated from him as a God of all comfort: “All they that are afar off shall perish”
(Psalm 73:27). This is the spring of all woe. What the Prodigal suffered, was because he would leave his
father, and live of himself. Wliosoever is ambitious to be his own heaven, will at last find his soul to
become its own hell. As it loved all things for itself, so it shall be grieved with all things for itself. As it
would be its own god against the right of God, it shall then be its own tormentor by the justice of God.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, Watch against this atheism, and be daily employed in the mortification of it. In every action
we shold make the inquiry, What is the rule I observe? Is it God’s will or my own? Whether do my
intentions tend to set up God or self? As much as we destroy this, we abate the power of sin: these two
things are the head of the serpent in us, which we must be bruising by the power of the cross. Sin is
nothing else but a turning from God, and centering in self, and most in the inferior part of self: if we bend
our force against those two, self-will and self-ends, we shall intercept atheism at the spring head, take
away that which doth constitute and animate all sin: the sparks must vanish if the fire be quenched which
affords them fuel. They are but two short things to ask in every undertaking: Is God my le in regard of his
will? Is God my end in regard of his glory? All sin lies in the neglect of these, all grace lies in the practice
of them. Without some degree of the mortification of these; we cannot make profitable and comfortable
approaches to God. When we come with idols in our hearts, we shall be answered according to the
multitude and the baseness of them too.308 What expectation of a good look from him can we have, when
we come before him with undeifying thoughts of him, a petition in our mouths, and a sword in our hearts,
to stab his honor To this purpose,
</p>
<p>
     1. Be often in the views of the excellencies of God. When we have no intercourse with God by
delightful meditations, we begin to be estranged from him, and prepare ourselves to live without God in
the world. Strangeness is the mother and nurse of disaffection: we slight men sometimes because we
know them not. The very beasts delight in the company of men; when being tamed and familiar, they
become acquainted with their disposition. A daily converse with God would discover so much of
loveliness in his nature, so much of sweetness in his ways, that our injurious thoughts of God would wear
off, and we should count it our honor to contemn ourselves and magnify him. By this means a slavish
fear, which is both a dishonor to God and a torment to the soul,309 and the root of atheism, will be cast
out, and an in Tenuous fear of him wrought in the heart. Exercised thoughts on him would issue out in
affections to him, which would engage our hearts to make him both our rule and our end. This course
would stifle any temptations to gross atheism, wherewith good souls are sometimes haunted, by
confirming us more in the belief of a God, and discourage any attempts to a deliberate practical atheism.
We are not like to espouse any principle which is confuted by the delightful converse we daily have with
him. The more we thus enter into the presence chamber of God, the more we cling about him with our
affections, the more vigorous and lively will the true notion of God grow up in us, and be able to prevent
anything which may dishonor him and debase our souls. Let us therefore consider him as the only
happiness; set up the true God in our understandings; possess our hearts with a deep sense of his desirable
excellency above all other things. This is the main thing we are to do in order to our great business: all the
directions in the world, with the neglect of this, will be insignificant ciphers. The neglect of this is
common, and is the basis of all the mischiefs which happen to the souls of men.
</p>
<p>
     2. Prize and study the Scripture. We can have no delight in meditation on him, unless we know him;
and we cannot know him but by the means of his own revelation; when the revelation is despised, the
revealer will be of little esteem. Men do not throw off God from being their rule, till they throw off
Scripture from being their guide; and God must needs be cast off from being an end, when the Scripture is
rejected from being a rule. Those that do not care to know his will, that love to be ignorant of his nature;
can never be affected to his honor. Let therefore the subtleties of reason veil to the doctrine of faith, and
the humor of the will to the command of the word.
</p>
<p>
     3. Take heed of sensual pleasures, and be very watchful and cautious in the use of those comforts God
allows us. Job was afraid, when his “sons feasted, that they should curse God in their hearts.”310 It was not
without cause that the apostle Peter joined sobriety with watchfulness and prayer (1 Pet. 4:7): “The end of
all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.”—A moderate use of worldly
comforts.—Prayer is the great acknowledgment of God, and too much sensuality is a hindrance of this,
and a step to atheism. Belshazzar’s lifting himself up against the Lord, and not glorifying of God, is
charged upon his sensuality (Dan. 5:23). Nothing is more apt to quench the notions of God, and root out
the conscience of him, than an addictedness to sensual pleasures. Therefore take heed of that snare.
</p>
<p>
     4. Take heed of sins against knowledge. The more sins against knowledge are committed, the more
careless we are, and the more careless we shall be of God and his honor; we shall more fear his judicial
power; and the more we fear that, the more we shall disaffect that God in whose hand vengeance is, and to
whom it doth belong. Atheism in conversation proceeds to atheism in affection, and that will endeavor to
sink into ageism in opinion and judgment.
</p>
<p>
     The sum of the whole.—And now consider in the whole what has been spoken.
</p>
<p>
     1. Man would set himself up as his own rule. He disowns the rule of God, is unwilling to have any
acquaintance with the rule God sets him, negligent in using the means for the knowledge of his will, and
endeavors to shake it off when any notices of it break in upon him; when he cannot expel it, he hath no
pleasure in the consideration of it, and the heart swells against it. When the notions of the will of God are
entertained, it is on some other consideration, or with wavering and unsettled affections. Many times men
design to improve some lust by his truth. This unwillingness respects truth as it is most spiritual and holy;
as it most relates and leads to God; as it is most contrary to self. He is guilty of contempt of the will of
God, which is seen in every presumptuous breach of his law; in the natural aversions to the declaration of
his will and mind, which way soever he turns; in slighting that part of his will which is most for his honor;
in the awkwardness of the heart when it is to pay God a service. A constraint in the first engagement,
slightness in the service, in regard of the matter, in regard of the frame, without a natural vigor. Many
distractions, much weariness, in deserting the rule of God, when our expectations are not answered upon
our service, in breaking promises with God. Man naturally owns any other rule rather than that of God’s
prescribing: the rule of Satan; the will of man; in complying more with the dictates of men than the will of
God; in observing that which is materially so, not because it is his will, but the injunctions of men; in
obeying the will of man when it is contrary to the will of God. This man doth in order to the setting up
himself. This is natural to man as he is corrupted. Men are dissatisfied with their own consciences when
they contradict the desires of self. Most actions in the world are done, more because they are agreeable to
self, than as they are honorable to God; as they are agreeable to natural and moral self, or sinful self. It is
evident in neglects of taking God’s directions upon emergent occasions; in counting the actions of others
to be good or bad, as they suit with, or spurn against our fancies and humors. Man would make himself
the rule of God, and give laws to his Creator, in striving against his law; disapproving of his methods of
government in the world; in impatience in our particular concerns; envying the gifts and prosperity of
others; corrupt matter or ends of prayer or praise; bold interpretations of the judgments of God in the
world; mixing rules in the worship of God with those which have been ordained by him; suiting
interpretations of Scripture with our own minds and humors; falling off from God after some fair
compliances, when his will grates upon us, and crosseth ours.
</p>
<p>
     2. Man would be his own end. This is natural and universal. This is seen in frequent self-applauses
and inward overweening reflections; in ascribing the glory of what we do or have to ourselves; in desire
of self-pleasing doctrines; in being highly concerned in injuries done to ourselves, and little or not at all
concerned for injuries done to God; in trusting in ourselves; in workings for carnal self against the light of
our own consciences: this is a usurping God’s prerogative, vilifying God, destroying God. Man would
make anything his end or happiness rather than God.
</p>
<p>
     This appears in the fewer thoughts we have of him than of anything else; in the greedy pursuit of the
world; in the strong addictedness to sensual pleasures; in paying a service, upon any success in the world,
to instruments more than to God: this is a debasing God in setting up a creature, but more in setting up a
base lust; it is a denying of God. Man would make himself the end of all creatures. In pride; using the
creatures contrary to the end God hath appointed: this is to dishonor God, and it is diabolical. Man would
make himself the end of God; in loving God, because of some self-pleasing benefits distributed by him; in
abstinence from some sins, because they are against the interest of some other beloved corruption; in
performing duties merely for a selfish interest, which is evident in unwieldiness in religious duties, where
self is not concerned; in calling upon God only in a time of necessity; in begging his assistance to our own
projects after we have by our own craft, laid the plot; in impatience upon a refusal of our desires; in
selfish aims we have in our duties: this is a vilifying God, a dethroning him; in unworthy imaginations of
God, universal in man by nature. Hence spring idolatry, superstition, presumption, the common disease of
the world. This is a vilifying God; worse than idolatry, worse than absolute atheism. Natural desires to be
distant from him; no desires for the remembrance of him; no desires of converse with him; no desires of a
thorough return to him; no desire of any close imitation of him.

<h1 class="caption">DISCOURSE III - ON GOD’S BEING A SPIRIT</h1>
<blockquote>
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
<div class="sig">JOHN 4:24</div>
</blockquote>                     

<p>THE words are part of the dialogue between our Saviour and the Samaritan woman.311 Christ,
intending to return from Judea to Galilee, passed through the country of Samaria, a place inhabited not by
Jews, but a mixed company o£ several nations, and some remainders of the posterity of Israel, who
escaped the captivity, and were returned from Assyria; and being weary with his journey, arrived about
the sixth hour or noon (according to the Jews’ reckoning the time of the day), at a well that Jacob had
digged, which was of great account among the inhabitants for the antiquity of it, as well as the usefulness
of it, in supplying their necessities: he being thirsty, and having none to furnish him wherewith to draw
water, at last comes a woman from the city, whom he desires to give him some water to drink. The
woman, perceiving him by his language or habit to be a Jew, wonders at the question, since the hatred the
Jews bore the Samaritans was so great, that they would not vouchsafe to have any commerce with them,
not only in religious, but civil affairs, and common offices belonging to mankind. Hence our Saviour
takes occasion to publish to her the doctrine of the gospel; and excuseth her rude answer by her ignorance
of him; and tells her, that if she had asked him a greater matter, even that which concerned her eternal
salvation, he would readily have granted it, notwithstanding the rooted hatred between the Jews and
Samaritans; and bestowed a water of a greater virtue, the “water of life.”312 The woman is no less
astonished at his reply than she was at his first demand. It was strange to hear a man speak of giving
living water to one of whom he had begged the water of that spring, and had no vessel to draw any to
quench his own thirst. She therefore demands whence he could have this water that he speaks of,313 since
she conceived him not greater than Jacob, who had digged that well and drank of it. Our Saviour, desirous
to make a progress in that work he had begun, extols the water he spake of, above this of the well, from its
particular virtue fully to refresh those that drank of it, and be as a cooling and comforting fountain within
them, of more efficacy than that without.314 The woman, conceiving a good opinion of our Saviour,
desires to partake of this water, to save her pains in coming daily to the well, not apprehending the
spirituality of Christ’s discourse to her:315 Christ finding her to take some pleasure in his discourse, partly
to bring her to a sense of her sin, before he did communicate the excellenty of his grace, bids her return
back to the city and bring her husband with her to him.316 She freely acknowledges that she had no
husband; whether having some check of conscience at present for the unclean life she led, or loth to lose
so much time in the gaining this water so much desired by her:317 our Saviour takes an occasion from this
to lay open her sin before her, and to make her sensible of her own wicked life and the prophetic
excellency of himself; and tells her she had had five husbands, to whom she had been false, and by whom
she was divorced, and the person she now dwelt with was not her lawful husband, and in living with him
she violated the rights of marriage, and increased guilt upon her conscience.318 The woman being affected
with this discourse, and knowing him to be a stranger that could not be certified of those things but in an
extraordinary way, begins to have a high esteem of him as a prophet.319 And upon this opinion she
esteems him able to decide a question, which had been canvassed between them and the Jews, about the
place of worship.320 Their fathers worshiping in that mountain, and the Jews affirming Jerusalem to be a
pace of worship, she pleads the antiquity of the worship in this place, Abraham having built an altar there
(Gen. 12:7), and Jacob, apon his return from Syria. And, surely, had the pace been capable of an
exception, such persons as they, and so well acquainted with the will of God, would not have pitched
upon that place to celebrate their worship. Antiquity hath, too, too often bewitched the minds of men, and
drawn them from the revealed will of God. Men are more willing to imitate the outward actions of their
famous ancestors, than conform themselves to the revealed will of their Creator. The Samaritans would
imitate the patriarchs in the place of worship, but not in the faith of the worshippers. Christ answers her,
that this question would quickly be resolved by a new state of the church, which was near at hand; and
neither Jerusalem, which had now the precedency, nor that mountain, should be of any more value in that
concern, than any other place in the world:321 but yet, to make her sensible of her am and that of her
countrymen, tells her, that their worship in that mountain was not according to the will of God, he having
long after the altars built in this place, fixed Jerusalem as the place of sacrifices; besides, they had not the
knowledge of that God which ought to be worshipped by them, but the Jews had the “true object of
worship,” and the “true manner of worship, according to the declaration God had made of himself to
them.”322 But all that service shall vanish, the veil of the temple shall be rent in twain, and that carnal
worship give place to one more spiritual; shadows shall fly before substance, and truth advance itself
above figures; and the worship of God shall be with the strength of the Spirit: such a worship, and such
worshippers doth the Father seek;323 for “God is a Spirit: and those that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.” The design of our Saviour is to declare, that God is not taken with external worship
invented by men, no, nor commanded by himself; and that upon this reason, because he is a spiritual
essence, infinitely above gross and corporeal matter, and is not taken with that pomp which is a pleasure
to our earthly imaginations.

     Πνεῦμα ὁ θεός. Some translate it just as the words lie: “Spirit is God.”324 But it is not unusual, both in
the Old and New Testament languages, to put the predicate before the subject, as Psalm 5:9, “Their throat
is an open sepulchre;” in the Hebrew, “A sepulchre open their throat;” so Psalm 111:3, “His work is
honorable and glorious;” Heb. “Honor and glory is his work;” and there wants not one example in the
same evangelist (John 1:1), “And the Word was God;” Greek, “And God was the Word:” in all, the
predicate, or what is ascribed, is put before the subject to which it is ascribed. One tells us, and he, a head
of a party that hath made a disturbance in the church of God,325 that this place is not aptly brought to
prove God to be a Spirit; and the reason of Christ runs not thus,—God is of a spiritual essence, and
therefore must be worshipped with a spiritual worship; for the essence of God is not the foundation of his
worship, but his will; for then we were not to worship him with a corporeal worship, because he is not a
body; but with an invisible and eternal worship, because he is invisible and eternal. But the nature of God
is the foundation of worship; the will of God is the rule of worship; the matter and manner is to be
performed according to the will of God. But is the nature of the object of worship to be excluded? No; as
the object is, so ought our devotion to be, spiritual as he is spiritual. God, in his commands for worship,
respected the discovery of his own nature; in the law, he respected the discovery of his mercy and justice,
and therefore commanded a worship by sacrifices; a spiritual worship without those institutions would not
have declared. those attributes which was God’s end to display to the world in Christ; and though the
nature of God is to be respected in worship, yet the obligations of the creature are to be considered. God is
a Spirit, therefore must have a spiritual worship; the creature hath a body as well as a soul, and both from
God; and therefore ought to worship God with the one as well as the other, since one as well as the other
is freely bestowed upon him. The spirituality of God was the foundation of the change from the Judaical
carnal worship to a more spiritual and evangelical.
</p>
<p>
     God is a Spirit; that is, he hath nothing corporeal, no mixture of matter, not a visible substance, a
bodily form.326 He is a Spirit, not a bare spiritual substance, but an understanding, willing Spirit, holy,
wise, good, and just. Before, Christ spake of the Father,327 the first person in the Trinity; now he speaks of
God essentially: the word Father is personal, the word God essential; so that our Saviour would render a
reason, not from any one person in the blessed Trinity, but from the Divine nature, why we should
worship in spirit, and therefore makes use of the word God, the being a Spirit being common to the other
persons with the Father. This is the reason of the proposition (Ver. 23.), “Of a spiritual worship.” Every
nature delights in that which is like it, and distastes that which is most different from it. If God were
corporeal, he might be pleased with the victims of beasts, and the beautiful magnificence of temples, and
the noise of music; but being a Spirit, he cannot be gratified with carnal things; he demands something
better and greater than all those,—that soul which he made, that soul which he hath endowed, a spirit of a
frame suitable to his nature. He indeed appointed sacrifices, and a temple, as shadows of those things
which were to be most acceptable to him in the Messiah, but they were imposed only “till the time of
reformation.”328
</p>
<p>
    Must worship him; not they may, or it would be more agreeable to God to have such a manner of
worship; but they must. It is not exclusive of bodily worship; for this were to exclude all public worship in
societies, which cannot be performed without reverential postures of the body.329 The gestures of the body
are helps to worship, and declarations of spiritual acts. We can scarcely worship God with our spirits
without some tincture upon the outward man; but he excludes all acts inerely corporeal, all resting upon
an external service and devotion, which was the crime of the Pharisees, and the general persuasion of the
Jews as well as heathens, who used the outward ceremonies, not as signs of better things, but as if they
did of themselves please God, and render the worshippers accepted with him, without any suitable frame
of the inward man.330 It is as if he had said, Now you must separate yourselves from all carnal modes to
which the service of God is now tied, and render a worship chiefly consisting in the affectionate motions
of the heart, and accommodated more exactly to the condition of the object, who is a Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    In spirit and truth.331 The evangelical service now required has the advantage of the former; that was a
shadow and figure, this the body and truth.332 Spirit, say some, is here opposed to the legal ceremonies;
truth, to hypocritical services; or, rather truth is opposed to shadows,333 and an opinion of worth in the
outward action; it is principally opposed to external rites, because our Saviour saith (Ver. 23.): “The hour
comes, and now is,” &amp;c. Had it been opposed to hypocrisy, Christ had said no new thing; for God always
required truth in the inward parts, and all true worshippers had served him with a sincere conscience and
single heart. The old patriarchs did worship God in spirit and truth, as taken for sincerity; such a worship
was always, and is perpetually due to God, because he always was, and eternally will be a Spirit.334 And it
is said, “The Father seeks such to worahip him,” not, shall seek; he always sought it; it always was
performed to him by one or other in the world: and the prophets had always rebuked them for resting
upon their outward solemnities (Isa. 53:7, and Micah 6:8): but a worship without legal rites was proper to
an evangelical state and the times of the gospel, God having then exhibited Christ, and brought into the
world the substance of those shadows, and the end of those institutions; there was no more need to
continue them when the true reason of them was ceased. All laws do naturally expire when the true reason
upon which they were first framed is changed. Or by spirit may be meant, such a worship as is kindled in
the heart by the breath of the Holy Ghost. Since we are dead in sin, a spiritual light and flame in the heart,
suitable to the nature of the object of our worship, cannot be raised in us without the operation of a
supernatural grace; and though the fathers could not worship God without the Spirit, yet in the gospel-
times, there being a fuller effusion of the Spirit, the evangelical state is called, “the administration of the
Spirit,” and “the newness of the Spirit,” in opposition to the legal economy, entitled the “oldness of the
letter.”335 The evangelical state is more suited to the nature of God than any other; such a worship God
must have, whereby he is acknowledged to be the true sanctifier and quickener of the soul. The nearer
God doth approach to us, and the more full his manifestations are, the more spiritual is the worship we
return to God. The gospel pares off the rugged parts of the law, and heaven shall remove what is material
in the gospel, and change the ordinances of worship into that of a spiritual praise.
</p>
<p>
    In the words there is: 1. A proposition,—“God is a Spirit;” the foundation of all religion. 2. An
inference,—“They that worship him,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    As God, a worship belongs to him; as a Spirit, a spiritual worship is due to him: in the inference we
have, 1. The manner of worship, “in spirit and truth;” 2. The necessity of such a worship, “must”
</p>
<p>
    The proposition declares the nature of God; the inference, the duty of man. The observations lie plain.
</p>
<p>
    Obs. 1. God is a pure spiritual being: “he is a Spirit.” 2. The worship due from the creature to God
must be agreeable to the nature of God, and purely spiritual. 3. The evangelical state is suited to the nature
of God.
</p>
<p>
     I. For the first: “God is a pure spiritual being.” It is the observation of one,336 that the plain assertion
of God’s being a Spirit is found but once in the whole Bible, and that is in this place; which may well be
wondered at, because God is so often described with hands, feet, eyes, and ears, in the form and figure of
a man. The spiritual nature of God is deducible from many places; but not anywhere, as I remember,
asserted totidem verbis, but in this text: some allege that place (2 Cor. 3:17), “The Lord is that Spirit,” for
the proof of it; but that seems to have a different sense: in the text, the nature of God is described; in that
place, the operations of God in the gospel. “It is not the ministry of Moses, or that old covenant, which
communicates to you that Spirit it speaks of; but it is the Lord Jesus, and the doctrine of the gospel
delivered by him, whereby this Spirit and liberty is dispensed to you; he opposes here the liberty of the
gospel to the servitude of the law;337 it is from Christ that a divine virtue difuseth itself by the gospel; it is
by him, not by the law, that we partake of that Spirit. The spirituality of God is as evident as his being.338
If we grant that God is, we must necessarily grant that, he cannot be corporeal, because a body is of an
imperfect nature. It will appear incredible to any that acknowledge God the first Being and Creator of all
things, that he should be a massy, heavy body, and have eyes and ears, feet and hands, as we have.—For
the explication of it,
</p>
<p>
     1. Spirit is taken various ways in Scripture. It signifies sometimes an aerial substance, as Psalm 11:6;
a horrible tempest (Heb. a spirit of tempest); sometimes the breath, which is a thin substance (Gen. 6:17):
“All flesh, wherein is the breath of life” (Heb. spirit of life). A thin substance, though it be material and
corporeal, is called spirit; and in the bodies of living creatures, that which is the principle of their actions
is called spirit, the animal and vital spirits. And the finer part extracted from plants and minerals we call
spirit, those volatile parts separated from that gross matter wherein they were immersed, because they
come nearest to the nature of an incorporeal substance; and from this notion of the word, it is translated to
signify those substances that are purely immaterial, as angels and the souls of men. Angels are called
spirit (Psalm 104:4) “Who makes his angels spint;”339 and not only good angels are so called, but evil
angels (Mark 1:27); souls of men are called spirit (Eccles. 12.); and the soul of Christ is called so (John
19:30; whence God is called “the God of the spirit of all flesh” (Num. 22:16). And spirit is opposed to
flesh (Isa. 31:3): “The Egyptians are flesh, and not spirit.” And our Saviour gives us the notion of a spirit
to be something above the nature of a body (Luke 24:39), “not having flesh and bones,” extended parts,
loads of gross matter. It is also taken for those things which are active and efficacious; because activity is
of the nature of a spirit: Caleb had another spirit (Num. 14:24), an active affection. The vehement motions
of sin are called spirit (Hos. 4:12): “the spirit of whoredoms,” in that sense that Prov. 29:11, “a fool utters
all his mind,” all his spirit; he knows not how to restrain the vehement motions of his mind. So that the
notion of a spirit is, that it is a fine, immaterial substance, an active being, that act itself and other things.
A mere body cannot act itself; as the body of man cannot move without the soul, no more than a ship can
move itself without wind and waves. So God is called a Spirit, as being not a body, not having the
greatness, figure, thickness, or length of a body, wholly separate from anything of flesh and matter. We
find a principle within us nobler than that of our bodies; and, therefore, we conceive the nature of God,
according to that which is more worthy in us, and not according to that which is the vilest part of our
natures. God is a most spiritual Spirit, more spiritual than all angels, all souls.340 As he exceeds all in the
nature of being, so he exceeds all in the nature of spirit: he hath nothing gross, heavy, material, in his
essence.
</p>
<p>
     2. When we say God is a Spirit, it is to be understood by way of negation. There are two ways of
knowing or describing God: by way of affirmation, affirming that of him by way of eminency, which is
excellent in the creature, as when we say God is wise, good; the other, by way of negation, when we
remove from God in our conceptions what is tainted with imperfection in the creature.341 The first
ascribes to him whatsoever is excellent; the other separates from him whatsoever is imperfect. The first is
like a limning, which adds one color to another to make a comely picture; the other is like a carving,
which pares and cuts away whatsoever is superfluous, to make a complete statue. This way of negation is
more easy; we better understand what God is not, than what he is; and most of our knowledge of God is
by this way; as when we say God is infinite, immense, immutable, they are negatives; he hath no limits, is
confined to no place, admits of no change.342 When we remove from him what is inconsistent with his
being, we do more strongly assert his being, and know more of him when we elevate him above all, anal
above our own capacity. And when we say God is a Spirit, it is a negation; he is not a body; he consists
not of various parts, extended one without and beyond another. He is not a spirit, so as our souls are, to be
the form of any body; a spirit, not as angels and souls are, but infinitely higher. We call him so, because,
in regard of our weakness, we have not any other term of excellency to express or conceive of him by; we
transfer it to God in honor, because spirit is the highest excellency in our nature: yet we must apprehend
God above any spirit, since his nature is so great that he cannot be declared by human speech, perceived
by human sense, or conceived by human understanding.
</p>
<p>
     II. The second thing, that “God is a Spirit.” Some among the heathens imagined God to have a
body;343 some thought him to have a body of air; some a heavenly body; some a human body;344 and
many of them ascribed bodies to their gods, but bodies without blood, without corruption, bodies made up
of the finest and thinnest atoms; such bodies, which, if compared with ours, were as no bodies. The
Sadducees also, who denied all spirits, and yet acknowledged a God, must conclude him to be a body, and
no spirit. Some among Christians have been of that opinion. Tertullian is charged by some, and excused
by others; and some monks of Egypt were so fierce for this error, that they attempted to kill one
Theophilus, a bishop, for not being of that judgment. But the wiser heathens were of another mind,345 and
esteemed it an unholy thing to have such imaginations of God.346 And some Christians have thought God
only to be free from anything of body, because he is omnipresent, immutable, he is only incorporeal and
spiritual; all things else, even the angels, are clothed with bodies, though of a neater matter, and a more
active frame than ours; a pure spiritual nature they allowed to no being but God. Scripture and reason
meet together to assert the spirituality of God. Had God had the lineaments of a body, the Gentiles had not
fallen under that accusation of changing his glory into that of a corruptible man.347 This is signified by the
name God gives himself (Exod. 3:14): “I am that I am;” a simple, pure, uncompounded being, without
any created mixture; as infinitely above the being of creatures as above the conceptions of creatures (Job
37:23); “Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out.” He is so much a Spirit, that he is the “Father of
spirits” (Heb. 12:9). The Almighty Father is not of a nature inferior to his children. The soul is a spirit; it
could not else exert actions without the assistance of the body, as the act of understanding itself, and its
own nature, the act of willing, and willing things against the incitements and interest of the body. It could
not else conceive of God, angels, and immaterial substances; it could not else be so active, as with one
glance to fetch a compass from earth to heaven, and by a sudden motion, to elevate the understanding
from an earthly thought, to the thinking of things as high as the highest heavens. If we have this opinion
of our souls, which, in the nobleness of their acts, surmount the body, without which the body is but a dull
inactive piece of clay, we must needs have a higher conception of God, than to clog him with any matter,
though of a finer temper than ours: we must conceive of him by the perfections of our souls, without the
vileness of our bodies. If God made man according to his image, we must raise our thoughts of God
according to the noblest part of that image, and imagine the exemplar or copy not to come short, but to
exceed the thing copied by it. God were not the most excellent substance if he were not a Spirit. Spiritual
substances are more excellent than bodily; the soul of man more excellent than other animals; angels more
excellent than men. They contain, in their own nature, whatsoever dignity there is in the inferior creatures;
God must have, therefore, an excellency above all those, and, therefore, is entirely remote from the
conditions of a body. It is a gross conceit, therefore, to think that God is such a spirit as the air is; for that
is to be a body as the air is, though it be a thin one; and if God were no more a spirit than that, or than
angels, he would not be the most simple being.348 Yet some think that the spiritual Deity was represented
by the air in the ark of the testament.349 It was unlawful to represent him by any image that God had
prohibited. Everything about the ark had a particular signification. The gold and other ornaments about it
signified something of Christ, but were unfit to represent the nature of God: a thing purely invisible, and
falling under nothing of sense, could not represent him to the mind of man. The air in the ark was the
fittest; it represented the invisibility of God, air being imperceptible to our eyes. Air diffuseth itself
through all parts of the world; it glides through secret passages into all creatures; it fills the space between
heaven and earth. There is no place wherein God is not present. To evidence this,
</p>
<p>
     1. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be Creator. All multitude begins in, and is reduced to unity.
As above multitude there is an absolute unity, so above mixed creatures there is an absolute sirn’licity.
You cannot conceive number without conceiving the beginning of it in that which was not number, viz. a
unit. You cannot conceive any mixture, but you must conceive some simple thing to be the original and
basis of it. The works of art done by rational creatures have their foundation in something spiritual. Every
artificer, watchmaker, carpenter, hath a model in his own mind of the work he designs to frame: the
material and outward fabric is squared according to an inward and spiritual idea. A spiritual idea speaks a
spiritual faculty as the subject of it. God could not have an idea of that vast number of creatures he
brought into being, if he had not had a spiritual nature.350 The wisdom whereby the world was created
could never be the fruit of a corporeal nature; such natures are not capable of understanding and
comprehending the things which are within the compass of their nature, much less of producing them; and
therefore beasts which have only corporeal faculties move to objects by the force of their sense, and have
no knowledge of things as they are comprehended by the understanding of man. All acts of wisdom speak
an intelligent and spiritual agent. The effects of wisdom, goodness, power, are so great and admirable,
that they bespeak him a more perfect and eminent being than can possibly be beheld under a bodily shape.
Can a corporeal substance put “wisdom in the inward parts, and give understanding to the heart?”351
</p>
<p>
     2. If God were not a pure Spirit, he could not be one. If God had a body, consisting of distinct
members, as ours; or all of one nature, as the water and air are, yet he were then capable of division, and
therefore could not be entirely one. Either those parts would be finite or infinite: if finite, they are not
parts of God; for to be God and finite is a contradiction; if infinite, then there are as many infinite as
distinct members, and therefore as many Deities. Suppose this body had all parts of the same nature, as air
and water hath, every little part of air is as much air as the greatest, and every little part of water is as
much water as the ocean; so every little part of God would be as much God as the whole; as many
particular Deities to make up God, as little atoms to compose a body. What can be more absurd? If God
had a body like a human body, and were compounded of body and soul, of substance and quality, he
could not be the most perfect unity; he would be made up of distinct parts, and those of a distinct nature,
as the members of a human body are. Where there is the greatest unity, there must be the greatest
simplicity; but God is one. As he is free from any change, so he is void of any multitude (Deut. 6:4): “The
Lord our God is one Lord.”
</p>
<p>
     3. If God had a body as we have, he would not be invisible. Every material thing is not visible: the air
is a body yet invisible, but it is sensible; the cooling quality of it is felt by us at every breath, and we know
it by our touch, which is the most material sense. Everybody that hath members like to bodies, is visible;
but God is invisible.352 The apostle reckons it amongst his other perfections (1 Tim. 1:17): “Now unto the
King eternal, immortal, invisible.” He is invisible to our sense, which beholds nothing but material and
colored things; and incomprehensible to our understanding, that conceives nothing but what is finite. God
is therefore a Spirit incapable of being seen, and infinitely incapable of being understood. If he be
invisible, he is also spiritual. If he had a body, and hid it from our eyes, he might be said not to be seen,
but could not be said to be invisible. When we say a thing is visible, we understand that it hath such
qualities which are the objects of sense, though we may never see that which is in its own nature to be
seen. God hath no such qualities as fall under the perception of our sense. His works are visible to us, but
not his Godhead.353 The nature of a human body is to be seen and handled; Christ gives us such a
description of it (Luke 24:39): “Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me
have;” but man hath been so far from seeing God, “that it is impossible he can see him” (1 Tim. 6:16).
There is such a disproportion between an infinite object and a finite sense and understanding, that it is
utterly impossible either to behold or comprehend him. But if God had a body more luminous and
glorious than that of the sun, he would be as well visible to us as the sun, though the immensity of that
light would dazzle our eyes, and forbid any close inspection into him by the virtue of our sense. We have
seen the shape and figure of the sun, but “no man hath ever seen the shape of God.”354 If God had a body,
he were visible, though he might not perfectly and fully be seen by us;355 as we see the heavens, though
we see not the extension, latitude, and greatness of them. Though God hath manifested himself in a bodily
shape (Gen. 18:1), and elsewhere Jehovah appeared to Abraham, yet the substance of God was not seen,
no more than the substance of angels was seen in their apparitions to men. A body was formed to be made
visible by them, and such actions done in that body, that spake the person that did them to be of a higher
eminency than a bare corporeal creature. Sometimes a representation is made to the inward sense and
imagination, as to Micaiah,356 and to Isaiah (6:1); but they saw not the essence of God, but some images
and figures of him proportioned to their sense or imagination. The essence of God no man ever saw, nor
can see. John 1:18. Nor doth it follow that God hath a body,357 because Jacob is said to “see God face to
face” (Gen. 32:30); and Moses had the like privilege (Deut. 34:10). This only signifies a fuller and clearer
manifestation of God by some representations offered to the bodily sense, or rather to the inward spirit.
For God tells Moses he could not see his face (Exod. 33:20); and that none ever saw the similitude of God
(Deut. 4:15). Were God a corporeal substance, he might in some measure be seen by corporeal eyes.
</p>
<p>
     4. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be infinite. All bodies are of a finite nature; everybody is
material, and every material thing is terminated. The sun, a vast body, hath a bounded greatness; the
heavens, of a mighty bulk, yet have their limits. If God had a body he must consist of parts, those parts
would be bounded and limited, and whatsoever is limited is of a finite virtue, and therefore below an
infinite nature. Reason therefore tells us, that the most excellent nature, as God is, cannot be of a
corporeal condition; because of the limitation and other actions which belong to every body. God is
infinite, “for the heaven of heavens cannot contain him” (2 Chron. 2:6). The largest heavens, and those
imaginary spaces beyond the world, are no bounds to him. He hath an essence beyond the bounds of the
world, and cannot be included in the vastness of the heavens. If God be infinite, then he can have no parts
in him; if he had, they must be finite or infinite: finite parts can never make ap an infinite being. A vessel
of gold, of a pound weight, cannot be made of the quantity of an ounce. Infinite parts they cannot be,
because then every part would be equal to the whole, as infinite as the whole, which is contradictory. We
see in all things every part is less than the whole bulk that is composed of it; as every member of a man is
less than the whole body of man. If all the parts were finite, then God in his essence were finite; and a
finite God is not more excellent than a creature: so that if God were not a Spirit, he could not be infinite.
</p>
<p>
     5. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be an independent being. Whatsoever is compounded of
many parts depends either essentially or integrally upon those parts; as the essence of a man depends upon
the conjunction and union of his two main parts, his soul and body; when they are separated, the essence
of a man ceaseth: and the perfection of a man depends upon every member of the body; so that if one be
wanting the perfection of the whole is wanting: as if a man hath lost a limb, you call him not a perfect
man, because that part is gone upon which his perfection as an entire man did depend. If God therefore
bad a body, the perfection of the Deity would depend upon every part of that body; and the more parts he
were compounded of, the more his dependency would be multiplied according to the number of those
parts of the body: for that which is compounded of many parts is more dependent than that which is
compounded of fewer. And because God would be a dependent being if he had a body, he could not be
the first being; for the compounding parts are in order of nature before that which is compounded by
them; as the soul and body are before the man which results from the union of them. If God had parts and
bodily members as we have, or any composition, the essence of God would result from those parts, and
those parts be supposed to be before God. For that which is a part, is before that whose part it is. As in
artificial things you may conceive it: all the parts of a watch or clock are in time before that watch which
is made by setting those parts together. In natural things you must suppose the members of a body framed
before you can call it a man; so that the parts of this body are before that which is constituted by them.
We can conceive no other of God, if he were not a pure, entire, unmixed Spirit. If he had distinct parts, he
would depend upon them; those parts would be before him; his essence would be the effect of those
distinct parts, and so be would not be absolutely and entirely the first being; but he is so (Isa. 44:6): “I am
the first, and I am the last.” He is the first; nothing is before him. Whereas, if he had bodily parts, and
those finite, it would follow, God is made up of those parts which are not God; and that which is not God,
is in order of nature before that which is God. So that we see if God were not a Spirit he could not be
independent.
</p>
<p>
     6. If God were not a Spirit, he were not immutable and unchangeable. His immutability depends upon
his simplicity. He is unchangeable in his essence, because he is a pure and unmixed spiritual Being.
Whatsoever is compounded of parts may be divided into those parts, and resolved into those distinct parts
which make up and constitute the nature. Whatsoever is compounded is changeable in its own nature,
though it should never be changed. Adam, who was constituted of body and soul, had he stood in
innocence, had not died; there had been no separation made between his soul and body whereof he was
constituted, and his body had not resolved into those principles of dust from whence it was extracted. Yet
in his own nature he was dissoluble into those distinct parts whereof he was compounded; and so the
glorified saints in heaven, after the resurrection, and the happy meeting of their souls and bodies in a new
marriage knot, shall never be dissolved; yet in their own nature they are mutable and dissoluble, and
cannot be otherwise, because they are made up of such distinct parts that may be separated in their own
nature, unless sustained by the grace of God: they are immutable by will, the will of God, not by nature.
God is immutable by nature as well as will: as he hath a necessary existence, so be hath a necessary
unchangeableness (Mal. 3:6), “I, the Lord, change not.” He is as unchangeable in his essence as in his
veracity and faithfulness: they are perfections belonging to his nature. But if he were not a pure Spirit, he
could not be immutable by nature.
</p>
<p>
     7. If God were not a pure Spirit, he could not be omnipresent. He is in heaven above, and the earth
below;358 he fills heaven and earth.359 The divine essence is at once in heaven and earth; but it is
impossible a body can be in two places at one and the same time. Since God is everywhere, he must be
spiritual. Had he a body, he could not penetrate all things; he would be circumscribed in place. He could
not be everywhere but in parts, not in the whole; one member in one place, and another in another; for to
be confined to a particular place, is the property of a body: but, since he is diffused through the whole
world, higher than heaven, deeper than hell, longer than the earth, broader than the sea,360 he hath not any
corporeal matter. If he had a body wherewith to fill heaven and earth, there could be no body besides his
own: it is the nature of bodies to bound one another, and hinder the extending of one another. Two bodies
cannot be in the same place in the same point of earth: one excludes the other; and it will follow hence
that we are nothing, no substances, mere illusions; there could be no place for anybody else.361 If his body
were as big as the world, as it must be if with that he filled heaven and earth, there would not be room for
him to move a hand or a foot, or extend a finger; for there would be no place remaining for the motion.
</p>
<p>
     8. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be the most perfect being. The more perfect anything is in the
rank of creatures, the more spiritual and simple it is, as gold is the more pure and perfect that hath least
mixture of other metals. If God were not a Spirit, there would be creatures of a more excellent nature than
God, as angels and souls, which the Scripture call spirits, in opposition to bodies. There is more of
perfection in the first notion of a spirit than in the notion of a body. God cannot be less perfect than his
creatures, and contribute an excellency of being to them which he wants himself. If angels and souls
possess such an excellency, and God want that excellency, he would be less than his creatures, and the
excellency of the effect would exceed the excellency of the cause. But every creature, even the highest
creature, is infinitely short of the perfection of God; for whatsoever excellency they have is finite and
limited; it is but a spark from the sun—a drop from the ocean; but God is unboundedly perfect, in the
highest manner, without any limitation; and therefore above spirits, angels, the highest creatures that were
made by him: an infinite sublimity, a pure act, to which nothing can be added, from which nothing can be
taken. “In him there is light and no darkness,”362 spirituality without any matter, perfection without any
shadow or taint of imperfection. Light pierceth into all things, preserves its own purity, and admits of no
mixture of anything else with it.

<p>
    Question. It may be said, If God be a Spirit, and it is impossible he can be otherwise than a Spirit, how
comes God so often to have such members as we have in our bodies ascribed to him, not only a soul, but
particular bodily parts, as heart, arms, hands, ayes, ears, face, and back parts? And how is it that he is
never called a Spirit in plain words, but in this text by our Saviour?
</p>
<p>
    Answer. It is true, many parts of the body, and natural affections of the human nature, are reported of
God in Scripture. Head,363 eyes and eye-lids,364 apple of the eye, mouth, &amp;c.; our affections also, grief,
joy, anger, &amp;c. But it is to be considered,
</p>
<p>
    1. That this is in condescension to our weakness. God being desirous to make himself known to man,
whom he created for his glory, humbles, as it were, his own nature to such representations as may suit and
assist the capacity of the creature; since by the condition of our nature nothing erects a notion of itself in
our understanding, but as it is conducted in by our sense.365 God hath served himself of those things
which are most exposed to our sense, most obvious to our understandings, to give us some acquaintance
with his own nature, and those things which otherwise we were not capable of having any notion of. As
our souls are linked with our bodies, so our knowledge is linked with our sense; that we can scarce
imagine anything, at first, but under a corporeal form and figure, till we come, by great attention to the
object, to make, by the help of reason, a separation of the spiritual substance from the corporeal fancy,
and consider it in its own nature. We are not able to conceive a spirit, without some kind of resemblance
to something below it, nor understand the actions of a spirit, without considering the operations of a
human body in its several members. As the glories of another life are signified to us by the pleasures of
this; so the nature of God, by a gracious condescension to our capacities, is signified to us by a likeness to
our own. The more familiar the things are to us which God uses to this purpose, the more proper they are
to teach us what he intends by them.
</p>
<p>
    2. All such representations are to signify the acts of God, as they bear some likeness to those which
we perform by those members he ascribes to himself. So that those members ascribed to him rather note
his visible operations to us, than his invisible nature; and signify that God doth some works like to those
which men do by the assistance of those organs of their bodies. So the wisdom of God is called his eye,
because he knows that with his mind which we see with our eyes.366 The efficiency of God is called his
hand and arm; because as we act with our hands, so doth God with his power. The divine efficacies are
signified:—by his eyes and ears, we understand his omniscience; by his face, the manifestation of his
favor; by his mouth, the revelation of his will; by his nostrils, the acceptation of our prayers; by his
bowels, the tenderness of his compassion; by his heart, the sincerity of his affections; by his hand, the
strength of his power; by his feet, the ubiquity of his presence. And in this, he intends instruction and
comfort: by his eyes, he signifies his watchfulness over us; by his ears, his readiness to hear the cries of
the oppressed;367 by his arm, his power—an arm to destroy his enemies, and an arm to relieve his
people.368 All those are attributed to God to signify divine actions, which he doth without bodily organs as
we do with them.
</p>
<p>
    3. Consider also, that only those members which are the instruments of the noblest actions, and under
that consideration, are used by him to represent a notion of him to our minds. Whatsoever is perfect and
excellent is ascribed to him, but nothing that savors of imperfection.369 The heart is ascribed to him, it
being the principle of vital actions, to signify the life that he hath in himself; watchful and discerning
ayes, not sleepy and lazy ones; a mouth to reveal his will, not to take in food. To eat and sleep are never
ascribed to him, nor those parts that belong to the preparing or transmitting nourishment to the several
parts of the body, as stomach, liver, reins, nor bowels under that consideration, but as they are significant
of compassion; but only those parts are ascribed to him whereby we acquire knowledge, as eyes and ears,
the organs of learning and wisdom; or to communicate it to others, as the mouth, lips, tongue, as they are
instruments of speaking, not of tasting; or those parts which signify strength and power, or whereby we
perform the actions of charity for the relief of others; taste and touch, senses that extend no farther than to
corporeal things, and are the grossest of all the senses, are never ascribed to him.
</p>
<p>
    4. It were worth consideration, “whether this describing God by the members of a human body were
so much figuratively to be understood, as with respect to the incarnation of our Saviour, who was to
assume the human nature, and all the members of a human body?”370 Asaph, speaking in the person of
God (Psalm 78:1), “I will open my mouth in parables;” in regard of God it is to be understood
figuratively, but in regard of Christ literally, to whom it is applied (Matt. 13:34, 35); and that apparition
(Isa. 6.) which was the appearance of Jehovah, is applied to Christ (John 12:40, 41). After the report of the
creation, and the forming of man, we read of God’s speaking to him, but not of God’s appearing. to him
in any visible shape.371 A voice might be formed in the air to give man notice of his duty; some way of
information he must have what positive laws he was to observe, besides that law which was engraves in
his nature, which we call the law of nature; and without a voice the knowledge of the divine will could not
be so conveniently communicated to man. Though God was heard in a voice, he was not seen in a shape;
but after the fall we several times read of his appearing in such a form; though we read of his speaking
before man’s committing of sin, yet not of his walking, which is more corporeal, till afterwards.372
“Though God would not have man believe him to be corporeal, yet he judged it expedient to give some
prenotices of that divine incarnation which he had promised.”373
</p>
<p>
    5. Therefore, we must not conceive of the visible Deity according to the letter of such expressions, but
the true intent of them. Though the Scripture speaks of his eyes and arm, yet it denies them to be “arms of
flesh.”374 We must not conceive of God according to the letter, but the design of the metaphor. When we
hear things described by metaphorical expressions, for the clearing them up to our fancy, we conceive not
of them under that garb, but remove the veil by an act of our reason. When Christ is called a sun, a vine,
bread, is any so stupid as to conceive him to be a vine with material branches, and clusters, or be of the
same nature with a loaf? But the things designed by such metaphors are obvious to the conception of a
mean understanding. If we would conceive God to have a body like a man, because he describes himself
so, we may conceit him to be like a bird, because he is mentioned with wings;375 or like a lion, or leopard,
because he likens himself to them in the acts of his strength and fury.376 He is called a rock, a horn, fire, to
note his strength and wrath; if any be so stupid as to think God to be really such, they would make him
not only a man but worse than a monster. Onkelos, the Chaldee paraphrast upon parts of the Scripture,
was so tender of expressing the notion of any corporeity in God, that when he meets with any expressions
of that nature, he translates them according to the true intent of them; as when God is said to descend
(Gen. 11:5), which implies a local motion, a motion from one place to another, he translates it, “And God
revealed himself.”377 We should conceive of God according to the design of the expressions; when we
read of his eyes, we should conceive his omniscience; of his hand, his power; of his sitting, his
immutability; of his throne, his majesty; and conceive of him as surmounting, not only the grossness of
bodies, but the spiritual excellency of the most dignified creatures; something so perfect, great, spiritual,
as nothing can be conceived higher and purer. “Christ,” with one, “is truly Deus figuratus; and for his
sake, was it more easily permitted to the Jews to think of God in the shape of a man.”378
</p>
<p>
    Use. If God be a pure spiritual being, then
</p>
<p>
    1. Man is not the image of God, according to his external bodily form and figure. The image of God in
man consisted not in what is seen, but in what is not seen; not in the conformation of the members, but
rather in the spiritual faculties of the soul; or, most of all, in the holy endowments of those faculties (Eph.
4:24): “That ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.”379 The
image which is restored by redeeming grace, was the image of God by original nature. The image of God
cannot be in that part which is common to us with beasts, but rather in that wherein we excel all living
creatures, in reason, understanding, and an immortal spirit. God expressly saith, that none “saw a
similitude” of him (Deut. 4:15, 16); whioh had not been true, if man, in regard of his body, had been the
image and similitude of God, for then a figure of God had been seen every day, as often as we saw a man
or beheld ourselves. Nor would the apostle’s argument stand good (Acts 17:29), “That the Godhead is not
like to stone graven by art,” if we were not the offspring of God, and bore the stamp of his nature in our
spirits rather than our bodies.380 It was a fancy of Eugubinus, that when God set upon the actual creation
of man, he took a bodily form for an exemplar of that which he would express in his work, and therefore
that the words of Moses381 are to be understood of the body of man; because there was in man such a
shape which God had then assumed. To let alone God’s forming himself a body for that work as a
groundless fancy, man can in no wise be said to be the image of God, in regard of the substance of his
body; but beasts may as well be said to be made in the image of God, whose bodies have the same
members as the body of man for the most part, and excel men in the acuteness of the senses and swiftness
of their motion, agility of body, greatness of strength, and in some kind of ingenuities also, wherein man
hath been a scholar to the brutes, and beholden to their skill. The soul comes nearest the nature of God, as
being a spiritual substance; yet considered singly, in regard of its spiritual substance, cannot well be said
to be the image of God; a beast, because of its corporeity, may as well be called the image of a man, for
there is a greater similitude between man and a brute, in the rank of bodies, than there can be between
God and the highest angels in the rank of spirits. If it doth not consist in the substance of the soul, much
less can it in any similitude of the body. This image consisted partly in the state of man, as he had
dominion over the creatures; partly in the nature of man, as he was an intelligent being, and thereby was
capable of having a grant of that dominion; but principally in the conformity of the soul with God, in the
frame of his spirit, and the holiness of his actions; not at all in the figure and form of his body, physically,
though morally there might be, as there was a rectitude in the body as an instrument to conform to the
holy motions of the soul, as the holiness of the soul sparkled in the actions and members of the body. If
man were like God because he hath a body, whatsoever hath a body hath some resemblance to God, and
may be said to be in part his image; but the truth is, the essence of all creatures cannot be an image of the
immense essence of God.
</p>
<p>
    2. If God be a pure Spirit, “it is unreasonable to frame any image or picture of God.”382 Some heathens
have been wiser in this than some Christians; Pythagoras forbade his scholars to engrave any shape of him
upon a ring, because he was not to be comprehended by sense, but conceived only in our minds: our
hands are as unable to fashion him, as our eyes to see him.383 The ancient Romans worshipped their gods
one hundred and seventy years before any material representations of them;384 and the ancient idolatrous
Germans thought it a wicked thing to represent God in a human shape; yet some, and those no Romanists,
labor to defend the making images of God in the resemblance of maji, because he is so represented in
Scripture: “He may be,” saith one,385 “conceived so in our minds, and figured so to our sense.” If this
were a good reason, why may he not be pictured as a lion, horn, eagle, rock, since he is under such
metaphors shadowed to us? The same ground there is for the one as for the other. What though man be a
nobler creature, God hath no more the body of a man than that of an eagle; and some perfections in other
creatures represent some excellencies in his nature and actions which cannot be figured by a human
shape, as strength by the lion, swiftness and readiness by the wings of the bird. But God hath absolutely
prohibited the making “any image” whatsoever of him, and that with terrible threatenings (Exod. 20:5):
“I, the Lord, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon their children,” and Deut. 5:8, 9.
After God had given the Israelites the commandment wherein he forbade them to have any other gods
before him, he forbids all figuring of him by the hand of man;386 not only images, but any likeness of him,
either by things in heaven, in the earth, or in the water. How often doth he discover his indignation by the
prophets, against them that offer to mould him in a creature form! This law was not to serve a particular
dispensation, or to endure a particular time, but it was a declaration of his will, invariable in all places and
all times; being founded upon the immutable nature of his being, and therefore agreeable to the law of
nature, otherwise not chargeable upon the heathens; and therefore when God had declared his nature and
his works in a stately and majestic eloquence, he demands of them, “To whom they would liken him, or
what likeness they would compare unto him?” (Isa. 40:18); where they could find anything that would be
a lively image and resemblance of his infinite excellency? founding it upon the infiniteness of his nature,
which necessarily implies the spirituality of it, God is infinitely above any statue: and those that think to
draw God by a stroke of a pencil, or form him by the engravings of art, are more stupid than the statues
themselves. To show the unreasonableness of it, consider,
</p>
<p>
     1. It is impossible to fashion any image of God. If our more capacious souls cannot grasp his nature,
our weaker sense cannot frame his image; it is more possible, of the two, to comprehend him in our
minds, than to frame him in an image to our sense. He inhabits inaccessible light; as it is impossible for
the eye of man to see him, it is impossible for the art of man to paint him upon walls, and carve him out of
wood. None knows him but himself, none can describe him but himself.387 Can we draw a figure of our
own souls, and express that part of ourselves, wherein we are most like to God? Can we extend this to any
bodily figure, and divide it into parts? How can we deal so with the original copy, whence the first
draught of our souls was taken, and which is infinitely more spiritual than men or angels? No corporeal
thing can represent a spiritual substance; there is no proportion in nature between them. God is a simple,
infinite, immense, eternal, invisible, incorruptible being; a statue is a compounded, finite, limited,
temporal, visible, and corruptible body. God is a living spirit; but a statue nor sees, nor hears, nor
perceives anything. But suppose God had a body, it is impossible to mould an image of it in the true glory
of that body; can the statue of an excellent monarch represent the majesty and air of his countenance,
though made by the skilfullest workman in the world? If God had a body in some measure suited to his
excellency, were it possible for man to make an exact image of him, who cannot picture the light, heat,
motion, magnitude, and dazzling property of the sun? The excellency of any corporeal nature of the (east
creature, the temper, instinct, artifice, are beyond the power of a carving tool; much more is God.
</p>
<p>
     2. To make any corporeal representations of God is unworthy of God. It is a disgrace to his nature.
Whosoever thinks a carnal corruptible image to be fit for a representation of God, renders God no better
than a carnal and a corporeal being. It is a kind of debasing an angel, who is a spiritual nature, to represent
him in a bodily shape, who is as far removed from any fleshliness as heaven from earth; much more to
degrade the glory of the divine nature to the lineaments of a man. The whole stock of images is but a lie
of God (Jer. 10:8, 14); a doctrine of vanities and falsehood; it represents him in a false garb to the world,
and sinks his glory into that of a corruptible creature.388 It impairs the reverence of God in the minds of
men, and by degrees may debase men’s apprehensions of God, and be a means to make them believe he is
such a one as themselves; and that not being free from the figure, he is not also free from the
imperfections of the bodies.389 Corporeal images of God were the fruits of base imaginations of him; and
as they sprung from them, so they contribute to a greater corruption of the notions of the divine nature: the
heathens begun their first representations of him by the image of a corruptible man, then of birds, till they
descended not only to four-footed beasts but creeping things, even serpents, as the apostle seems to
intimate in his enumeration (Rom. 1:23): it had been more honorable to have continued in human
representations of him, than have sunk so low as beasts and serpents, the baser images; though the first
had been infinitely unworthy of him, he being more above a man, though the noblest creature, than man is
above a worm, a toad, or the most despicable creeping thing upon the earth. To think we can make an
image of God of a piece of marble, or an ingot of gold, is a greater debasing of him, than it would be of a
great prince, if you should represent him in the statue of a frog. When the Israelites represented God by a
calf it is said “they sinned a great sin” (Exod. 32:31): and the sin of Jeroboam, who intended only a
representation of God by the calves at Dan and Bethel, is called more emphatically,390 “the wickedness of
your wickedness,” the very scum and dregs of wickedness. As men debased God by this, so God debased
men for this; he degraded the Israelites into captivity, under the worst of their enemies, and punished the
heathens with spiritual judgments, as uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts (Rom. 1:24);
which is repeated again in other expressions (ver. 26, 27), as a meet recompense for their disgracing the
spiritual nature of God. Had God been like to man, they had not offended in it; but I mention this, to show
a probable reason of those base lusts which are in the midst of us, that have scarce been exceeded by any
nation, viz., the unworthy and unspiritual conceits of God, which are as much a debasing of him as
material images were when they were more rife in the world; and may be as well the cause of spiritual
judgments upon men, as the worshipping molten and carve images were the cause of the same upon the
heathen.
</p>
<p>
    3. Yet this is natural to man. Wherein we may see the contrariety of man to God. Though God be a
Spirit, yet there is nothing man is more prone to, than to represent him under a corporeal form. The most
famous guides of the heathen world have fashioned him, not only according to the more honorable images
of men, but bestialized him in the form of a brute. The Egyptians, whose country was the school of
learning to Greece, were notoriously guilty of this brutishness in worshipping an ox for an image of their
God; and the Philistines their Dagon, in a figure composed of the image of a woman and a fish:391 such
epresentations were ancient in the oriental parts. The gods of Laban, that he accuseth Jacob of stealing
from him, are supposed to be little figures of men.392 Such was the Israelites’ golden calf; their worship
was not terminated on the image, but they worshipped the true God under that representation; they could
not be so brutish as to call a calf their deliverer, and give him so great a title (“These be thy gods, O Israel,
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,” Exod. 32:4): or that which they knew belonged to the
true God, “the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”393 They knew the calf to be formed of their ear-rings,
but they had consecrated it to God as a representation of him; though they chose the form of the Egyptian
idol, yet they knew that Apis, Osiris, and Isis, the gods of the Egyptians adored in that figure, had not
wrought their redemption from bondage, but would have used their force, had they been possessed of any,
to have kept them under the yoke, rather than have freed them from it; the feast also which they celebrated
before that image, is called by Aaron the feast of the Lord (Exod. 32:5); a feast to Jehovah, the
incommunicable name of the creator of the world; it is therefore evident, that both the priest and the
people pretended to serve the true God, not any false divinity of Egypt; that God who had rescued them
from Egypt, with a mighty hand, divided the Red Sea before them, destroyed their enemies, conducted
them, fed them by miracle, spoken to them from Mount Sinai, and amazed them by his thunderings and
lightnings when he instructed them by his law; a God whom they could not so soon forget. And with this
representing God by that image, they are charged by the Psalmist (Psalm 106:19, 20), “they made a calf in
Horeb, and changed their glory into a similitude of an ox that eateth grass:” they changed their glory, that
is, God, the glory of Israel; so that they took this figure for the image of the true God of Israel, their own
God; not the God of any other nation in the world. Jeroboam intended no other by his calves, but symbols
of the presence of the true God; instead of the ark and the propitiatory which remained among the Jews.
We see the inclination of our natures in the practice of the Israelites; a people chosen out of the whole
world to bear up God’s name, and preserve his glory; and in that the images of God were so soon set up in
the Christian church; and to this day, the picture of God, in the shape of an old man, is visible in the
temple of the Romanists. It is prone to the nature of man,
</p>
<p>
    4. To represent God by a corporeal image; and to worship him in and by that image, is idolatry.
Though the Israelites did not acknowledge the calf to be God, nor intended a worship to any of the
Egyptian deities by it; but worshipped that God in it, who had so lately and miraculously delivered them
from a cruel servitude; and could not in natural reason judge him to be clothed with a bodily shape, much
less to be like an ox that eateth grass; yet the apostle brings no less a charge against them than that of
idolatry (1 Cor. 10:7); he calls them idolaters, who before that calf kept a feast to Jehovah, citing Exod.
32:5. Suppose we could make such an image of God as might perfectly represent him; yet since God hath
prohibited it, shall we be wiser than God? He hath sufficiently manifested himself in his works without
images: He is seen in the creatures, more particularly in the heavens, which declare his glory His works
are more excellent representations of him, as being the works of his own hands, than anything that is the
product of the art of man. His glory sparkles in the heavens, sun, moon, and stars, as being magnificent
pieces of his wisdom and power; yet the kissing the hand to the sun or the heavens, as representatives of
the excellency and majesty of God, is idolatry in Scripture account, and a denial of God;394 a prostituting
the glory of God to a creature. Either the worship is terminated on the image itself, and then it is
confessed by all to be idolatry, because it is a giving that worship to a creature which is the sole right of
God, or not terminated in the image, but in the object represented by it; it is then a foolish thing; we may
as well terminate our worship on the true object without, as with an image.395 An erected statue is no sign
or symbol of God’s special presence, as the ark, tabernacle, temple were. It is no part of divine institution;
has no authority of a command to support it; no cordial of a promise to encourage it; and the image being
infinitely distant from, and below the majesty and spirituality of God, cannot constitute one object of
worship with him. To put a religious character upon any image formed by the corrupt imagination of man,
as a representation of the invisible and spiritual Deity, is to think the Godhead to be like silver and gold,
or stone graven by art and man’s device.396
</p>
<p>
    III. This doctrine will direct us in our conceptions of God, as a pure perfect Spirit, than which nothing
can be imagined more perfect, more pure, more spiritual.
</p>
<p>
    1. We cannot have an adequate or suitable conception of God: He dwells in inaccessible light;
inaccessible to the acuteness of our fancy, as well as the weakness of our sense. If we could have thoughts
of him, as high and excellent as his nature, our conceptions must be as infinite as his nature. All our
imaginations of him cannot represent him, because every created species is finite; it cannot therefore
represent to us a full and substantial notion of an infinite Being. We cannot speak or think worthily
enough of him, who is greater than our words, vaster than our understandings. Whatsoever we speak or
think of God, is handed first to us by the notice we have of some perfection in the creature, and explains
to us some particular excellency of God, rather than the fulness of his essence. No creature, nor all
creatures together, can furnish us with such a magnificent notion of God, as can give us a clear view of
him. Yet God in his word is pleased to step below his own excellency, and point us to those excellencies
in his works, whereby we may ascend to the knowledge of those excellencies which are in his nature. But
the creatures, whence we draw our lessons, being finite, and our understandings being finite, it is utterly
impossible to have a notion of God commensurate to the immensity and spirituality of his being. “God is
not like to visible creatures, nor is there any proportion between him and the most spiritual.”397 We cannot
have a full notion of a spiritual nature, much less can we have of God, who is a Spirit above spirits. No
spirit can clearly represent him: the angels, that are great sphits, are bounded in their extent, finite in their
being, and of a mutable nature. Yet though we cannot have a suitable conception of God, we must not
content ourselves without any conception of him. It is our sin not to endeavor after a true notion of him: it
is our sin to rest in a mean and low notion of him, when our reason tells us we are capable of having
higher: but if we ascend as high as we can, though we shall then come short of a suitable notion of him,
this is not our sin, but our weakness. God is infinitely superior to the choicest conceptions, not only of a
sinner, but of a creature. If all conceptions of God below the true nature of God were sin, there is not a
holy angel in heaven free from sin; because, though they are the most capacious creatures, yet they cannot
have such a notion of an infinite Being as is fully suitable to his nature, unless they were infinite as he
himself is.
</p>
<p>
     2. But, however, we must by no means conceive of God under a human or corporeal shape. Since we
cannot have conceptions honorable enough for his nature, we must take heed we entertain not any which
may debase his nature; though we cannot comprehend him as he is, we must be careful not to fancy him
to be what he is not. It is a vain thing to conceive him with human lineaments: we must think higher of
him than to ascribe to him so mean a shape we deny his spirituality when we fancy him under such a
form. He is spiritual, and between that which is spiritual and that which is corporeal, there is no
resemblance.398 Indeed, Daniel saw God in a human form (Dan. 7:9): “The Ancient of days did sit, whose
garment was white as snow, and the hairs of his head like pure wool:” he is described as coming to
judgment; it is not meant of Christ probably, because Christ (ver. 13) is called the Son of Man coming
near to the Ancient of days. This is not the proper shape of God, for no man hath seen his shape. It was a
vision wherein such representations were made, as were accommodated to the inward sense of Daniel;
Daniel saw him in a rapture or ecstacy, wherein outward senses are of no use. God is described, not as he
is in himself, of a human form, but in regard of his fitness to judge: “white,” notes the purity and
simplicity of the Divine nature; “Ancient of days,” in regard of his eternity; “white hair,” in regard of his
prudence and wisdom, which is more eminent in age than youth, and more fit to discern causes and to
distinguish between right and wrong. Visions are riddles, and must not be understood in a literal sense.
We are to watch against such determinate conceptions of God. Vain imaginations do easily infest us;
tinder will not sooner take fire than our natures kindle into wrong notions of the Divine Majesty. We are
very apt to fashion a god like ourselves; we must therefore look upon such representations of God, as
accommodated to our weakness: and no more think them to be literal descriptions of God, as he is in
himself, than we will think the image of the sun in the water, to be the true sun in the heavens. We may,
indeed, conceive of Christ as man, who hath in heaven the vestment of our nature, and is Deus figuratus,
though we cannot conceive the godhead under a human shape.
</p>
<p>
     1. To have such a fancy is to disparage and wrong God. A corporeal fancy of God is as ridiculous in
itself, and as injurious to God, as a wooden statue. The caprices of our imagination are often more
mysterious than the images which are the works of art; it is as irreligious to measure God’s essence by our
line, his perfections by our imperfections, as to measure his thoughts and actings by the weakness and
unworthiness of our own. This is to limit an infinite essence, and pull him down to our scanty measures,
and render that which is unconceivably above us, equal with us. It is impossible we can conceive God
after the manner of a body, but we must bring him down to the proportion of a body, which is to diminish
his glory, and stoop him below the dignity of his nature. God is a pure Spirit, he hath nothing of the nature
and tincture of a body; whosoever, therefore, conceives of him as having a bodily form, though he fancy
the most beautiful and comely body, instead of owning his dignity, detracts from the super-eminent
excellency of his nature and blessedness. When men fancy God like themselves in their corporeal nature,
they will soon make a progress, and ascribe to him their corrupt nature; and while they clothe him with
their bodies, invest him also in the infirmities of them. God is a jealous God, very sensible of any
disgrace, and will be as much incensed against an inward idolatry as an outward: that command which
forbade corporeal images,399 would not indulge /carnal imaginations; since the nature of God is as much
wronged by unworthy images, erected in the fancy, as by statues carved out of stone or metals: one as
well as the other is a deserting of our true spouse, and committing adultery; one with a material image,
and the other with a carnal notion of God. Since God humbles himself to our apprehensions, we should
not debase him in thinking him to be that in his nature, which he makes only a resemblance of himself to
us.
</p>
<p>
    2. To have such fancies of God, will obstruct and pollute our worship of him. How is it possible to
give him a right worship, of whom we have so debasing a notion? We shall never think a corporeal deity
worthy of a dedication of our spirits. The hating instruction, and casting God’s word behind the back, is
charged upon the imagination they had, that “God was such a one as themselves” (Psalm 50:17, 21).
Many of the wiser heathens did not judge their statues to be their gods, or their gods to be like their
statues; but suited them to their politic designs; and judged them a good invention to keep people within
the bounds of obedience and devotion, by such visible figures of them, which might imprint a reverence
and fear of those gods upon them; but these are false measures; a despised and undervalued God is not an
object of petition or affection. Who would address seriously to a God he has low apprehensions of? The
more raised thoughts we have of him, the viler sense we shall have of ourselves; they would make us
humble and self-abhorrent in our supplications to him (Job 42:6): “wherefore I abhor myself,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    3. Though we must not conceive of God, as of a human or corporeal shape; yet we cannot think of
God, without some reflection upon our own being. We cannot conceive him to be an intelligent being, but
we must make some comparison between him and our own understanding nature to come to a knowledge
of him. Since we are enclosed in bodies, we apprehend nothing but what comes in by sense, and what we
in some sort measure by sensible objects. And in the consideration of those things which we desire to
abstract from sense, we are fain to make use of the assistance of sense and visible things: and therefore
when we frame the highest notion, there will be some similitude of some corporeal thing in our fancy; and
though we would spiritualize our thoughts, and aim at a more abstracted and raised understanding, yet
there will be some dregs of matter sticking to our conceptions; yet we still judge by argument and
reasoning, what the thing is we think of under those material images. A corporeal image will follow us, as
the shadow doth the body.400 While we are in the body, and surrounded with fleshly matter, we cannot
think of things without some help from corporeal representations: something of sense will interpose itself
in our purest conceptions of spiritual things;401 for the faculties which serve for contemplation, are either
corporeal, as the sense and fancy, or so allied to them, that nothing passes into them but by the organs of
the body; so that there is a natural inclination to figure nothing but under a corporeal notion, till by an
attentive application of the mind and reason to the object thought upon, we separate that which is bodily
from that which is spiritual, and by degrees ascend to that true notion of that we think upon, and would
have a due conception of in our mind. Therefore God tempers the declaration of himself to our weakness,
and the condition of our natures. He condescends to our littleness and narrowness, when he declares
himself by the similitude of bodily members. As the light of the sun is tempered, and difuseth itself to our
sense through the air and vapors, that our weak eyes may not be too much dazzled with it; without it we
could not know or judge of the sun, because we could have no use of our sense, which we must have
before we can judge of it in our understanding; so we are not able to conceive of spiritual beings in the
purity of their own nature, without such a temperament, and such shadows to usher them into our minds.
And therefore we find the Spirit of God accommodates himself to our contracted and teddered capacities,
and uses such expressions of God as are suited to us in this state of flesh wherein we are. And therefore
because we cannot apprehend God in the simplicity of his own being, and his undivided essence, he draws
the representations of himself from several creatures and several actions of those creatures: as sometimes
he is said to be angry, to walk, to sit, to fly; not that we should rest in such conceptions of him, but take
our rise from this foundation, and such perfections in the creatures, to mount up to a knowledge of God’s
nature by those several steps, and conceive of him by those divided excellencies, because we cannot
conceive of him in the purity of his own essence. We cannot possibly think or speak of God, unless we
transfer the names of created perfections to him;402 yet we are to conceive of them in a higher manner
when we apply them to the Divine nature, than when we consider them in the several creatures formally,
exceeding those perfections and excellencies which are in the creature, and in a more excellent manner:
“as one saith, though we cannot comprehend God without the help of such resemblances, yet we may,
without making an image of him; so that inability of ours excuseth those apprehensions of him from any
way offending against his Divine nature.”403 These are not notions so much suite to the nature of God as
the weakness of man. They are helps to our meditations, but ought not to be formal conceptions of him.
We may assist ourselves in our apprehensions of him, by considering the subtilty and spirituality of air;
and considering the members of a body, without thinking him to be air, or to have any corporeal member.
Our reason tells us, that whatsoever is a body, is limited and bounded; and the notion of infiniteness and
bodiliness, cannot agree and consist together: and therefore what is offered by our fancy should be
purified by our reason.
</p>
<p>
     4. Therefore we are to elevate and refine all our notions of God, and spiritualize our conceptions of
him. Every man is to have a conception of God; therefore he ought to have one of the highest elevation.
Since we cannot have a full notion of him, we should endeavor to make it as high and as pure as we can.
Though we cannot conceive of God, but some corporeal representations or images in our minds will be
conversant with us, as motes in the air when we look upon the heavens, yet our conceptions may and must
rise higher. As when we see the draught of the heavens and earth in a globe, or a kingdom in a map, it
helps our conceptions, but doth not terminate them: we conceive them to be of a vast extent, far beyond
that short description of them. So we should endeavor to refine every representation of God, to rise higher
and higher, and have our apprehensions still more purified; separating the perfect from the imperfect,
casting away the one, and greatening the other; conceive him to be a Spirit diffused through all,
containing all, perceiving all. All the perfections of God are infinitely elevated above the excellencies of
the creatures; above whatsoever can be conceived by the clearest and most piercing understanding. The
nature of God as a Spirit is infinitely superior to whatsoever we can conceive perfect in the notion of a
created spirit. Whatsoever God is, he is infinitely so: he is infinite Wisdom, infinite Goodness, infinite
Knowledge, infinite Power, infinite Spirit; infinitely distant from the weakness of creatures, infinitely
mounted above the excellencies of creatures: as easy to be known that he is, as impossible to be
comprehended what he is. Conceive of him as excellent, without any imperfection; a Spirit without parts;
great without quantity; perfect without quality; everywhere without place; powerful without members;
understanding without ignorance; wise without reasoning; light without darkness; infinitely more
excelling the beauty of all creatures, than the light in the sun, pure and unviolated, exceeds the splendor of
the sun dispersed and divided through a cloudy and misty air: and when you have risen to the highest,
conceive him yet infinitely above all you can conceive of spirit, and acknowledge the infirmity of your
own minds. And whatsoever conception comes into your minds, say, This is not God; God is more than
this: if I could conceive him, he were not God; for God is incomprehensibly above whatsoever I can say,
whatsoever I can think and conceive of him.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 1. If God be a Spirit, no corporeal thing can defile him. Some bring an argument against the
omnipresence of God, that it is a disparagement to the Divine essence to be everywhere, in nasty cottages
as well as beautiful palaces and garnished temples. What place can defile a spirit? Is light, which
approaches to the nature of spirit, polluted by shining upon a dunghill, or a sunbeam tainted by darting
upon a quagmire? Doth an angel contract any soil, by stepping into a nasty prison to deliver Peter? What
can steam from the most noisome body to pollute the spiritual nature of God? As he is “of purer eyes than
to behold iniquity,”404 so he is of a more spiritual substance than to contract any physical pollution from
the places where he doth diffuse himself. Did our Saviour, who had a true body, derive any taint from the
lepers he touched, the diseases he cured, or the devils he expelled? God is a pure Spirit; plungeth himself
into no filth; is dashed with no spot by being present with all bodies. Bodies only receive defilement from
bodies.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 2. If God be a Spirit, he is active and communicative. He is not clogged with heavy and
sluggish matter, which is cause of dulness and inactivity. The more subtle, thin, and approaching nearer
the nature of a spirit anything is, the more diffusive it is. Air is a gliding substance; spreads itself through
all regions, pierceth into all bodies; it fills the space between heaven and earth; there is nothing but
partakes of the virtue of it. Light, which is an emblem of spirit, insinuates itself into all places, refresheth
all things. As spirits are fuller, so they are more overflowing, more piercing, more operative than bodies.
The Egyptian horses were weak things, because they were “flesh, and not spirit.”405 The soul being a
spirit, conveys more to the body than the body can to it. What cannot so great a spirit do for us? What
cannot so great a spirit work in us? God, being a spirit above all spirits, can pierce into the centre of all
spirits; make his way into the most secret recesses; stamp what he pleases. It is no more to him to turn our
spirits, than to make a wilderness become waters, and speak a chaos into a beautiful frame of heaven and
earth. He can act our souls with infinite more ease than our souls can act our bodies; he can fix in us what
motions, frames, inclinations he pleases; he can come and settle in our hearts with all his treasures. It is an
encouragement to confide in him, when we petition him for spiritual blessings: as he is a spirit, he is
possessed with “spiritual blessings.”406 A spirit delights to bestow things suitable to its nature, as bodies
do to communicate what is agreeable to theirs. As he is a Father of spirits, we may go to him for the
welfare of our spirits; he being a Spirit, is as able to repair our spirits as he was to create them. As he is a
Spirit, he is indefatigable in acting. The members of the body tire and flag; but who ever heard of a soul
wearied with being active? who ever heard of a weary angel? In the purest simplicity, there is the greatest
power, the most efficacious goodness, the most reaching justice to affect the spirit, that can insinuate itself
everywhere to punish wickedness without weariness, as well as to comfort goodness. God is active,
because he is spirit; and if we be like to God, the more spiritual we are, the more active we shall be.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 3. God being a Spirit, is immortal. His being immortal, and being invisible, are joined
together.407 Spirits are in their nature incorruptible; they can only perish by that hand that framed them.
Every compounded thing is subject to mutation; but God, being a pure and simple Spirit, is without
corruption, without any shadow of change.408 Where there is composition, there is some kind of
repugnancy of one part against the other; and where there is repugnancy, there is a capability of
dissolution. God, in regard of his infinite spirituality, hath nothing in his own nature contrary to it; can
have nothing in himself which is not himself. The world perishes; friends change and are dissolved;
bodies moulder, because they are mutable. God is a Spirit in the highest excellency and glory of spirits;
nothing is beyond him; nothing above him; no contrariety within him. This is our comfort, if we devote
ourselves to him; this God is our God; this Spirit is our Spirit; this is our all, our immutable, our
incorruptible support; a Spirit that cannot die and leave us.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 4. If God be a Spirit, we see how we can only converse with him by our spirits. Bodies and
spirits are not suitable to one another: we can only see, know, embrace a spirit with our spirits. He judges
not of us by our corporeal actions, nor our external devotions by our masks and disguises: he fixes his eye
upon the frame of the heart, bends his ear to the groans of our spirits. He is not pleased with outward
pomp. He is not a body; therefore the beauty of temples, delicacy of sacrifices, fumes of incense, are not
grateful to him; by those, or any external action, we have no communion with him. A spirit, when broken,
is his delightful sacrifice;409 we must therefore, have our spirits fitted for him, “be renewed in the spirit of
our minds,”410 that we may be in a posture to live with him, and have an intercourse with him. We can
never be united to God but in our spirits: bodies unite with bodies, spirits with spirits. The more spiritual
anything is, the more closely doth it unite. Air hath the closest union; nothing meets together sooner than
that, when the parts are divided by the interposition of a body.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 5. If God be a Spirit, he can only be the true satisfaction of our spirits: spirit can only be
filled with spirit: content flows from likeness and suitableness. As we have a resemblance to God in
regard of the spiritual nature of our soul, so we can have no satisfaction but in him. Spirit can no more be
really satisfied with that which is corporeal, than a beast can delight in the company of an angel.
Corporeal things can no more fill a hungry spirit, than pure spirit can feed an hungry body. God, the
highest Spirit, can only reach out a full content to our spirits. Man is lord of the creation: nothing below
him can be fit for his converse; nothing above him offers itself to his converse but God. We have no
correspondence with angels. The influence they have upon us, the protection they afford us, is secret and
undiscerned; but God, the highest Spirit, offers himself to us in his Son, in his ordinances, is visible in
every creature, presents himself to us in every providence; to him we must seek; in him we must rest. God
had no rest from the creation till he had made man; and man can have no rest in the creation till he rests in
God. God only is our dwelling place;411 our souls should only long for him:412 our souls should only wait
upon him. The spirit of man never riseth to its original glory, till it be carried up on the wings of faith and
love to its original copy. The face of the soul looks most beautiful, when it is turned to the face of God,
the Father of spirits; when the derived spirit is fixed upon the original Spirit, drawing from it life and
glory. Spirit is only the receptacle of spirit. God, as Spirit, is our principle; we must therefore live upon
him. God, as Spirit, hath some resemblance to us as his image; we must, therefore, only satisfy ourselves
in him.
</p>
<p>
    Inference 6. If God be a Spirit, we should take most care of that wherein we are like to God. Spirit is
nobler than body; we must, therefore, value our spirits above our bodies. The soul, as spirit, partakes more
of the divine nature, and deserves more of our choicest cares. If we have any love to this Spirit, we should
have a real affection to our own spirits, as bearing a stamp of the spiritual Divinity, the chiefest of all the
works of God; as it is said of behemoth (Job 40:19). That which is most the image of this immense spirit,
should be our darling; so David calls his soul (Psalm 35:17). Shall we take care of that wherein we
partake not of God, and not delight in the jewel which hath his own signature upon it? God was not only
the Framer of spirits, and the End of spirits; but the Copy and Exemplar of spirits. God partakes of no
corporeity; he is pure Spirit. But how do we act, as if we were only matter and body! We have but little
kindness for this great Spirit as well as our own, if we take no care of his immediate offspring, since he is
not only Spirit, but the Father of spirits.413
</p>
<p>
    Inference 7. If God be a Spirit, let us take heed of those sins which are spiritual. Paul distinguisheth
between the filth of the flesh, and that of the spirit.414 By the one we defile the body; by the other we
defile the spirit, which, in regard of its nature, is of kin to the Creator. To wrong one who is near of kin to
a prince, is worse than to injure an inferior subject. When we make our spirits, which are most like to God
in their nature, and framed according to his image, a stage to act vain imaginations, wicked desires, and
unclean affections, we wrong God in the excellency of his work, and reflect upon the nobleness of the
pattern; we wrong him in that part where he hath stamped the most signal character of his own spiritual
nature; we defile that whereby we have only converse with him as a Spirit, which he hath ordered more
immediately to represent him in this nature, than all corporeal things in the world can, and make that
Spirit with whom we desire to be joined unfit for such a knot. God’s spirituality is the root of his other
perfections. We have already heard he could not be infinite, omnipresent, immutable, without it. Spiritual
sins are the greatest root of bitterness within us. As grace in our spirits renders us more like to a spiritual
God, so spiritual sins bring us into a conformity to a degraded devil.415 Carnal sins change us from men to
brutes, and spiritual sins divest us of the image of God for the image of Satan. We should by no means
make our spirits a dunghill, which bear upon them the character of the spiritual nature of God, and were
made for his residence. Let us, therefore, behave ourselves towards God in all those ways which the
spiritual nature of God requires us.

<h1 class="caption"> DISCOURSE IV - ON SPIRITUAL WORSHIP</h1>
<blockquote>
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
<div class="sig"> JOHN 4:24</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
    HAVING thus despatched the first proposition, “God is a Spirit,” it will not be amiss to handle the
inference our Saviour makes from that proposition, which is the second observation propounded.
</p>
<p>
    Doct. That the worship due from us to God ought to be spiritual, and spiritually performed. Spirit and
truth are understood variously. We are to worship God,
</p>
<p>
    1. Not by legal ceremonies. The evangelical administration being called spirit, in opposition to the
legal ordinances as carnal; and truth in opposition to them as typical. As the whole Judaical service is
called flesh, so the whole evangelical service is called spirit; or spirit may be opposed to the worship at
Jerusalem, as it was carnal; truth, to the worship on the Mount Gerizim, because it was false. They had
not the true object of worship, nor the true medium of worship as those at Jerusalem had. Their worship
should cease, because it was false; and the Jewish worship should cease, because it was carnal. There is
no need of a candle when the sun spreads his beams in the air; no need of those ceremonies when the Sun
of righteousness appeared; they only served for candles to instruct and direct men till the time of his
coming. The shadows are chased away by displaying the substance, so that they can be of no more use in
the worship of God, since the end for which they were instituted is expired; and that discovered to us in
the gospel, which the Jews sought for in vain among the baggage and stuff’ of their ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
    2. With a spiritual and sincere frame. In spirit, i. e. with spirit; with the inward operations of all the
faculties of our souls, and the cream and flower of them; and the reason is, because there ought to be a
worship suitable to the nature of God; and as the worship was to be spiritual, so the exercise of that
worship ought to be in a spiritual manner.416 It shall be a worship “in truth,” because the true God shall be
adored without those vain imaginations and fantastic resemblances of him,417 which were common among
the blind Gentiles, and contrary to the glorious nature of God, and unworthy ingredients in religious
services. It shall be a worship “in spirit,” without those carnal rites the degenerate Jews rested on; such a
posture of soul which is the life and ornament of every service God looks for at your hands. There must
be some proportion between the object adored, and the manner in which we adore it; it must not be a mere
corporeal worship, because God is not a body; but it must rise from the centre of our soul, because God is
a Spirit. If he were a body, a bodily worship might suit him, images might be fit to represent him; but
being a Spirit, our bodily services enter us not into communion with him. Being a spirit, we must banish
from our minds all carnal imaginations of him, and separate from our wills all cold and dissembled
affections to him. We must not only have a loud voice, but an elevated soul; not only a bended knee, but a
broken heart; not only a supplicating tone, but a groaning spirit; not only a ready ear for the word, but a
receiving heart; and this shall be of greater value with him, than the most costly outward services offered
at Gerizim or Jerusalem. Our Saviour certainly meant not by worshipping in spirit, only the matter of the
evangelical service, as oppose to the legal administration, without the manner wherein it was to be
performed. It is true, God always sought a worship in spirit; he expected the heart of the worshipper
should join with his instituted rights of adoration in every exercise of them; but he expects such a carriage
more under the gospel administration, because of the clearer discoveries of his nature made in it, and the
greater assistances conveyed by it.
</p>
<p>
    I shall, therefore, 1. Lay down some general propositions. 2. Show what this spiritual worship is. 3.
Why we must offer to God a spiritual service. 4. The use.
</p>
<p>
    1. Some general propositions.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. I. The right exercise of worship is founded upon, and riseth from, the spirituality of God.418 The
first ground of the worship we render to God, is the infinite excellency of his nature, which is not only
one attribute, but results from all; for God, as God, is the object of worship; and the notion of God
consists not in thinking him wise, good, just, but all those infinitely beyond any conception; and hence it
follows that God is an object infinitely to be loved and honored. His goodness is sometimes spoken of in
Scripture as a motive of our homage (Psalm 130:4): “There is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be
feared.” Fear, in the Scripture dialect, signifies the “whole worship of God” (Acts 10:35): but in every
nation, “he that fears him” is accepted of him.419 If God should act towards men according to the rigors of
his justice due to them for the least of their crimes, there could be no exercise of any affection but that of
despair, which could not engender a worship of God, which ought to be joined with love, not with hatred.
The beneficence and patience of God, and his readiness to pardon men, is the reason of the honor they
return to him; and this is so evident a motive, that generally the idolatrous world ranked those creatures in
the number of their gods, which they perceived useful and beneficial to mankind, as the sun and moon,
the Egyptians the ox, &amp;c. And the more beneficial anything appeared to mankind, the higher station men
gave it in the rank of their deities, and bestowed a more peculiar and solemn worship upon it. Men
worshipped God to procure and continue his favor, which would not have been acted by them, had they
not conceived it a pleasing thing to him to be merciful and gracious. Sometimes his justice is proposed to
us as a motive of worship (Heb. 12:28, 29): “Serve God with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a
consuming fire;” which includes his holiness, whereby he doth hate sin, as well as his wrath, whereby he
doth punish it. Who but a mad and totally brutish person, or one that was resolved to make war against
heaven, could behold the effects of God’s anger in the world, consider him in his justice as a “consuming
fire,” and despise him, and rather be drawn out by that consideration to biasphemy and despair, than to
seek all ways to appease him? Now though the infinite power of God, his unspeakable wisdom, his
incomprehensible goodness, the holiness of his nature, the vigilance of his evidence, the bounty of his
hand, signify to man that he should love and honor him, and are the motives of worship; yet the
apirituality of his nature is the rule of worship, and directs us to render our duty to him with all the powers
of our soul. As his goodness beams out upon us, worship is due in justice to him; and as he is the most
excellent nature, veneration is due to him in the highest manner with the choicest affections. So that
indeed the spirituality of God comes chiefly into consideration in matter of worship: all his perfections are
grounded upon this: he could not be infinite, immutable, omniscient, if he were a corporeal being;420 we
cannot give him a worship unless we judge him worth, excellent, and deserving a worship at our hands;
and we cannot judge him worthy of a worship, unless we have some apprehensions and admirations of his
infinite virtues; and we cannot apprehend and admire those perfections, but as we see them as causes
shining in their effects. When we see, therefore, the frame of the world to be the work of his power, the
order of the world to be the fruit of his wisdom, and the usefulness of the world to be the product of his
goodness, we find the motives and reasons of worship; and weighing that this power wisdom, goodness,
infinitely transcend any corporeal nature, we find a rule of worship, that it ought to be offered by us in a
manner suitable to such a nature as is infinitely above any bodily being. His being a Spirit declares what
he is; his other perfections declare what kind of Spirit he is. All God’s perfections suppose him a Spirit;
all centre in this; his wisdom doth not suppose him merciful, or his mercy suppose him omniscient; there
may be distinct notions of those, but all suppose him to be of a spiritual nature. How cold and frozen will
our devotions be, if we consider not his omniscience, whereby he discerns our hearts! How carnal will our
services be, if we consider him not as a pure Spirit!421 In our offers to, and transactions with men, we deal
not with them as mere animals, but as rational creatures; and we debase their natures if we treat them
otherwise; and if we have not raised apprehensions of God’s spiritual nature in our treating with him, but
allow him only such frames as we think fit enough for men, we debase his spirituality to the littleness of
our own being. We must, therefore, possess our souls with this; we shall else render him no better than a
fleshly service. We do not much concern ourselves in those things of which we are either utterly ignorant,
or have but slight apprehensions of. That is the first proposition;—The right exercise of worship is
grounded upon the spirituality of God.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. II. This spiritual worship of God is manifest by the light of nature, to be due to him. In reference
to this, consider,
</p>
<p>
    1. The outward means or matter of that worship which would be acceptable to God, was not known by
the light of nature. The law for a worship, and for a spiritual worship by the faculties of our souls was
natural, and part of the law of creation; though the determination of the particular acts, whereby God
would have this homage testified, was of positive institution, and depended not upon the law of creation.
Though Adam in innocence knew God was to be worshipped, yet by nature he did not know by what
outward acts he was to pay this respect, or at what time he was more solemnly to be exercised in it than at
another: this depended upon the directions God, as the sovereign Governor and Lawgiver, should
prescribe. You therefore find the positive institutions of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” and
the determination of the time of worship (Gen. 2:3, 17). Had there been any such notion in Adam
naturally, as strong as that other, that a worship was due to God, there would have been found some relics
of these modes universally consented to by mankind, as well as of the other. But though all nations have
by an universal consent concurred in the acknowledgment of the being of God, and his right to adoration,
and the obligation of the creature to it; and that there ought to be some public rule and polity in matters of
religion (for no nation hath been in the world without a worship, and without external acts and certain
ceremonies to signify that worship); yet their modes and rites have been as various as their climates,
unless in that common notion of sacrifices, not descending to them by nature, but tradition from Adam;
and the various ways of worship have been more provoking. than pleasing. Every nation suited the kind of
worship to their particular ends and polities they designed to rule by. How God was to be worshipped is
more difficult to be discerned by nature with its ayes out than with its eyes clear.422 The pillars upon
which the worship of God stands cannot be discerned without revelation, no more than blind Samson
could tell where the pillars of the Philistines’ theatre stood, without one to conduct him. What Adam
could not see with his sound eyes, we cannot with our dim eyes; he must be told from heaven what
worship was fit for the God of heaven. It is not by nature that we can have such a full prospect of God as
may content and quiet us; this is the noble effect of Divine revelation; He only knows himself, and can
only make himself known to us. It could not be supposed that an infinite God should have no perfections
but what were visible in the works of his hands; and that these perfections should not be infinitely greater,
than as they were sensible in their present effects: this had been to apprehend God a limited Being;
meaner than he is. Now it is impossible to honor God as we ought, unless we know him as he is; and we
could not know him as he is, without divine revelation from himself; for none but God can acquaint us
with his own nature: and therefore the nations void of this conduct, heaped up modes of worahip from
their own imaginations, unworthy of the majesty of God, and below the nature of man. A rational man
would scarce have owned such for signs of honor, as the Scripture mentions in the services of Baal and
Dagon; much less an infinitely wise and glorious God. And when God had signified his mind to his own
people, how unwilling were they to rest satisfied with God’s determination, but would be warping to their
own inventions, and make gods, and ways of worship to themselves!423 as in the matter of the golden calf,
as was lately spoken of.
</p>
<p>
    2. Though the outward manner of worship acceptable to God could not be known without revelation,
and those revelations might be various; yet the inward manner of worship with our spirits was manifest by
nature: and not only manifest by nature to Adam in innocence, but after his fall, and the scales he had
brought upon his understanding by that fall. When God gave him his positive institutions before the fall,
or whatsoever additions God should have made, had he persisted in that state; or, when he appointed him,
after his fall, to testify his acknowledgment of him by sacrifices, there needed no command to him to
make those acknowledgments by those outward ways prescribed to him, with the intention and prime
affection of his spirit: this nature would instruct him in without revelation; for he could not possibly have
any semblance of reason to think that the offering of beasts, or the presenting the first fruits of the
increase of the ground, as an acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over him and his bounty to him, was
sufficient, without devoting to him that part wherein the image of his Creator did consist: he could not but
discern, by a reflection upon his own being, that he was made for God as well as by God: for it is a natural
principle of which the apostle speaks (Rom. 11:36), “For of him, and through him, and to him are all
things,” &amp;c.: that the whole whereof he did consist was due to God; and that his body, the dreggy and
dusty part of his nature, was not fit to be brought alone before God, without that nobler principle, which
he had, by creation, linked with it. Nothing in the whole law of nature, as it is informed of religion, was
clearer, next to the being of a God, than this manner of worshipping God with the mind and spirit. And as
the Gentiles never sunk so low into the mud of idolatry, as to think the images they worshiped were really
their gods, but the representations, or habitations of their gods; so they never deserted this principle in the
notion of it, that God was to be honored with the best they were, and the best they had: as they never
denied the being of a God in the notion, though they did in the practice, so they never rejected this
principle in notion, though they did, and now most men do, in the inward observation of it: it was a
maxim among them that God was mens animus, mind and spirit, and therefore was to be honored with the
mind and spirit: that religion did not consist in the ceremonies of the body, but the work of the soul;
whence the speech of one of them: “Sacrifice to the gods, not so much clothed with purple garments as a
pure heart:”424 and of another: “God regards not the multitude of the sacrifices, but the disposition of the
sacrificer.”425 It is not fit we should deny God the cream and the flower, and give him the flotten part and
the stalks. And with what reverence and intention of mind they thought their worship was to be
performed, is evident by the priests crying out often, Hoc age, Mind this, let your spirits be intent upon it.
This could not but result,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) From the knowledge of ourselves. It is a natural principle, “God hath made us, and not we
ourselves” (Psalm 100:1, 2). Man knows himself to be a rational creature; as a creature he was to serve his
Creator, and as a rational creature with the best part of that rational nature he derived from him. By the
same act of reason that he knows himself to be a creature, he knows himself to have a Creator; that this
Creator is more excellent than himself, and that an honor is due from him to the Creator for framing of
him; and, therefore, this honor was to be offered to him by the most excellent part which was framed by
him. Man cannot consider himself as a thinking, understanding, being, but he must know that he must
give God the honor of his thoughts, and worship him with those faculties whereby he thinks, wills, and
acts.426 He must know his faculties were given him to act, and to act for the glory of that God who gave
him his soul, and the faculties of it; and he could not in reason think they must be only active in his own
service, and the service of the creature, and idle and unprofitable in the service of his Creator. With the
same powers of our soul, whereby we contemplate God, we must also worship God; we cannot think of
him but with our minds, nor love him but with our will; and we cannot worship him without the acts of
thinking and loving, and therefore cannot worship him without the exercise of our inward faculties: how
is it possible then for any man that knows his own nature, to think that extended hands, bended knees, and
lifted up eyes, were sufficient acts of worship, without a quickened and active spirit?
</p>
<p>
     (2.) From the knowledge of God. As there was a knowledge of God by nature, so the same nature did
dictate to man, that God was to be glorified as God; the apostle implies the inference in the charge he
brings against them for neglecting it.427 “We should speak of God as he is,” said one;428 and the same
reason would inform them that they were to act towards God as he is. The excellency of the object
required a worship according to the dignity of his nature, which could not be answered but by the most
serious inward affection, as well as outward decency; and a want of this cannot but be judged to be
unbecoming the majesty of the Creator of the world, and the excellency of religion. No nation, no person,
did ever assert, that the vilest part of man was enough for the most excellent Being, as God is; that a
bodily service could be a sufficient acknowledgment for the greatness of God, or a sufficient return for the
bounty of God. Man could not but know that he was to act in religion conformably to the object of
religion, and to the excellency of his own soul:429 the notion of a God was sufficient to fill the mind of
man with admiration and reverence, and the first conclusion from it would be to honor God, and that he
have all the affection placed on him that so infinite and spiritual a Being did deserve: the progress then
would be, that this excellent Being was to be honored with the motions of the understanding and will,
with the purest and most spiritual powers in the nature of man, because he was a spiritual being, and had
nothing of matter mingled with him. Such a brutish imagination, to suppose that blood and fumes, beasts
and incense, could please a Deity, without a spiritual frame, cannot be supposed to befall any but those
that had lost their reason in the rubbish of sense. Mere rational nature could never conclude that so
excellent a Spirit would be put off with a mere animal service; an attendance of matter and body without
spirit, when they themselves, of an inferior nature, would be loth to sit down contented with an outside
service from those that belong to them; so that this instruction of our Saviour, that God is to be
worshipped in spirit and truth, is conformable to the sentiments of nature, and drawn from the most
undeniable principles of it. The excellency of God’s nature, and the excellent constitution of human
faculties, concur naturally to support this persuasion; this was as natural to be known by men, as the
necessity of justice and temperance for the support of human societies and bodies. It is to be feared, that if
there be not among us such brutish apprehensions, there are such brutish dealings with God, in our
services, against the light of nature; when we place all our worship of God in outward attendances and
drooping countenances, with unbelieving frames and formal devotions; when prayer is muttered over in
private, slightly, as a parrot learns lessons by rote, not understanding what it speaks, or to what end it
speaks it; not glorifying God in thought and spirit, with understanding and will.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. III. Spiritual worship therefore was always required by God, and always offered to him by one
or other. Man had a perpetual obligation upon him to such a worship from the nature of God; and what is
founded upon the nature of God is invariable. This and that particular mode of worship may wax old as a
garment, and as a vesture may be folded up and changed, as the expression is of the heavens;430 but God
endures forever; his spirituality fails not, therefore a worship of him in spirit must run through all ways
and rites of worship. God must cease to be Spirit, before any service but that which is spiritual can be
accepted by him. The light of nature is the light of God; the light of nature being unchangeable, what was
dictated by that, was alway, and will alway be, required by God. The worship of God being perpetually
due from the creature, the worshipping him as God is as perpetually his right. Though the outward
expressions of his honor were different, one way in Paradise (for a worship was then due, since a solemn
time for that worship was appointed), another under the law, another under the gospel; the angels also
worship God in heaven, and fall down before his throne; yet, though they differ in rites, they agree in this
necessary ingredient, all rites, though of a different shape, must be offered to him, not as carcasses, but
animated with the affections of the soul. Abel’s sacrifice had not been so excellent in God’s esteem,
without those gracious habits and affections working in his soul.431 Faith works by love; his heart was on
fire as well as his sacrifice. Cain rested upon his present; perhaps thought he had obliged God; he
depended upon the outward ceremony, but sought not for the inward purity: it was an offering brought to
the Lord;432 he had the right object, but not the right manner (Gen. 4:7.): “If thou doest well, shalt thou
not be accepted?” And in the command afterwards to Abraham, “Walk before me, and be thou perfect,”
was the direction in all our religious acts and walkings with God. A sincere act of the mind and will,
looking above and beyond all symbols, extending the soul to a pitch far above the body, and seeing the
day of Christ through the veil of the ceremonies, was required by God: and though Moses, by God’s
order, had instituted a multitude of carnal ordinances, sacrifices, washings, oblations of sensible things,
and recommended to the people the diligent observation of those statutes, by the allurements of promises
and denouncing of threatenings; as if there were nothing else to be regarded, and the true workings of
grace were to be buried under a heap of ceremonies; yet sometimes he doth point them to the inward
worship, and, by the command of God, requires of them the “circumcision of the heart” (Deut. 10:16), the
turning to God with “all their heart and all their soul” (Deut.30:10): whereby they might recollect, that it
was the engagement of the heart and the worship of the Spirit that was most agreeable to God; and that he
took not any pleasure in their observance of ceremonies, without true piety within, and the true purity of
their thoughts.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. IV. It is, therefore, as much every man’s duty to worship God in spirit, as it is their duty to
worship him. Worship is so due to him as God, as that he that denies it disowns his deity; and spiritual
worship is so due, that he that waives it denies his spirituality. It is a debt of justice we owe to God, to
worship him; and it is as much a debt of justice to worship him according to his nature. Worship is
nothing else but a rendering to God the honor that is due to him; and, therefore, the right posture of our
spirits in it is as much, or more, due, than the material worship in the modes of his own prescribing: that
is, grounded both upon his nature and upon his command; this only upon his command, that is perpetually
due; whereas, the channel wherein outward worship runs may be dried up, and the river diverted another
way; such a worship wherein the mind thinks of God, feels a sense of God, has a spirit consecrated to
God, the heart glow in with affections to God; it is else a mocking God with a feather. A rational nature
must worship God with that wherein the glory of God doth most sparkle in him. God is most visible in the
frame of the soul, it is there his image glitters; he hath given us a jewel as well as a case, and the jewel as
well as the case we must return to him; the spirit is God’s gift, and must “return to him;”433 it must return
to him in every service morally, as well as it must return to him at last physically. It is not fit we should
serve our Maker only with that which is the brute in us, and withhold from him that which doth constitute
us reasonable creatures; we must give him our bodies, but a “living sacrifice.”434 If the spirit be absent
from God when the body is before him, we present a dead sacrifice; it is morally dead in the duty, though
it be naturally alive in the posture and action. It is not an indifferent thing whether we shall worship God
or no; nor is it an indifferent thing whether we shall worship him with our spirits or no; as the excellency
of man’s knowledge consists in knowing things as they are in truth, so the excellency of the will in
willing things as they are in goodness. As it is the excellency of man, to know God as God; so it is no less
his excellency, as well as his duty to honor God as God. As the obligation we have to the power of God
for our being, binds us to a worship of him; so the obligation we have to his bounty for fashioning us
according to his own image, binds us to an exercise of that part wherein his image doth consist. God hath
“made all things for himself” (Prov. 16:4), that is, for the evidence of his own goodness and wisdom; we
are therefore to render him a glory according to the excellency of his nature, discovered in the frame of
our own. It is as much our sin not to glorify God as God, as not to attempt the glorifying of him at all; it is
our sin not to worship God as God, as well as to omit the testifying any respect at all to him. As the
Divine nature is the object of worship, so the Divine perfections are to be honored in worship; we do not
honor God if we honor him not as he is; we honor him not as a Spirit, if we think him not worthy of the
ardors and ravishing admirations of our spirits. If we think the devotions of the body are sufficient for
him, we contract him into the condition of our own being; and not only deny him to be a spiritual nature,
but dash out all those perfections which he could not be possessed of were he not a Spirit.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. V. The ceremonial law was abolished to promote the spirituality of divine worship. That service
was gross, carnal, calculated for an infant and sensitive church. It consisted is rudiments, the circumcision
of the flesh, the blood and smoke of sacrifices, the steams of incense, observation of days, distinction of
meats, corporal purifications; every leaf of the law is clogged with some rite to be particularly observed
by them. The spirituality of worship lay veiled under a thick cloud, that the people could not behold the
glory of the gospel, which lay covered under those shadows (2 Cor. 3:13): “They could not steadfastly
look to the end of that which is abolished:” They understood not the glory and spiritual intent of the law,
and therefore came short of that spiritual frame in the worship of God, which was their duty. And
therefore in opposition to this administration, the worship of God under the gospel is called by our
Saviour in the text, a worship in spirit; more spiritual for the matter, more spiritual for the motives, and
more spiritual for the manner and frames of worship.
</p>
<p>
     1. This legal service is called flesh in Scripture, in opposition to the gospel, which is called spirit. The
ordinances of the law, though of divine institution, are dignified by the apostle with no better a title than
carnal ordinances,435 and a carnal command:436 but the gospel is called the ministration of the Spirit, as
being attended with a special and spiritual efficacy on the minds of men.437 And when the generate
Galatians, after having tasted of the pure streams of the gospel, turned about to drink of the thicker
streams of the law, the apostle tells them, that they begun in the spirit and would now be made perfect in
the flesh;438 they would leave the righteousness of faith for a justification by works. The moral law, which
is in its own nature spiritual,439 in regard of the abuse of it, in expectation of justification by the outward
works of it, is called flesh: much more may the ceremonial administration, which was never intended to
run parallel with the moral, nor had any foundation in nature as the other had. That whole economy
consisted in sensible and material things, which only touched the flesh: it is called the letter and the
oldness of the letter;440 as letters, which are but empty sounds of themselves, but put together and formed
into words, signify something to the mind of the hearer or reader: an old letter, a thing of no efficacy upon
the spirit, but as a law written upon paper. The gospel hath an efficacious spirit attending it, strongly
working upon the mind and will, and moulding the soul into a spiritual frame for God, according to the
doctrine of the gospel; the one is old and decays, the other is new and increaseth daily. And as the law
itself is called flesh, so the observers of it and resters in it are called Israel after the flesh;441 and the
evangelical worshipper is called a Jew after the spirit (Rom. 2:29). They were Israel after the flesh as born
of Jacob; not Israel after the spirit as born of God; and therefore the apostle calls them Israel and not
Israel;442 Israel after a carnal birth, not Israel after a spiritual; Israel in the circumcision of the flesh, not
Israel by a regeneration of the heart.
</p>
<p>
     2. The legal ceremonies were not a fit means to bring the heart into a spiritual frame. They had a
spiritual intent; the rock and manna prefigured the salvation and spiritual nourishment by the
Redeemer.443 The sacrifices were to point them to the justice of God in the punishment of sin, and the
mercy of God in substituting them in their steads, as types of the Redeemer and the ransom by his blood.
The circumcision of the flesh was to instruct them in the circumcision of the heart: they were flesh in
regard of their matter, weakness and cloudiness, spiritual in regard of their intent and signification; they
did instruct, but not afficaciously work strong spiritual affections in the soul of the worshipper. They were
weak and beggarly elements;444 had neither wealth to enrich nor strength to nourish the soul: they could
not perfect the comers to them, or put them into a frame agreeable to the nature of God,445 nor purge the
conscience from those dead and dull dispositions which were by nature in them:446 being carnal they
could not have an efficacy to purify the conscience of the offerer and work spiritual effects: had they
continued without the exhibition of Christ, they could never have wrought any change in us or purchased
any favor for us.447 At the best they were but shadows, and came inexpressibly short of the efficacy of that
person and state whose shadows they were. The shadow of a man is too weak to perform what the man
himself can do, because it wants the life, spirit, and activity of the substance: the whole pomp and scene
was suited more to the sensitive than the intellectual nature; and, like pictures, pleased the fancy of
children rather than improved their reason. The Jewish state was a state of childhood,448 and that
administration a pedagogy.449 The law was a schoolmaster fitted for their weak and childish capacity, and
could no more spiritualize the heart, than the teachings in a primer-school can enable the mind, and make
it fit for affairs of state; and because they could not better the spirit, they were instituted only for a time,
as elements delivered to an infant age, which naturally lives a life of sense rather than a life of reason. It
was also a servile state, which doth rather debase than elevate the mind; rather carnalize than spiritualize
the heart: besides, it is a sense of mercy that both melts and elevates the heart into a spiritual frame:
“There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared;”450 and they had, in that state, but some
glimmerings of mercy in the daily bloody intimations of justice. There was no sacrifice for some sins, but
a cutting off without the least hints of pardon; and in the yearly remembrance of sin there was as much to
shiver them with fear, as to possess them with hopes; and such a state which always held them under the
conscience of sin, could not produce a free spirit, which was necessary for a worship of God according to
his nature.
</p>
<p>
    3. In their use they rather hindered than furthered a spiritual worship. In their own nature they did not
tend to the obstructing a spiritual worship, for then they had been contrary to the nature of religion, and
the end of God who appointed them; nor did God cover the evangelical doctrine under the clouds of the
legal administration, to hinder the people of Israel from perceiving it, but because they were not yet
capable to bear the splendor of it, had it been clearly set before them. The shining of the face of Moses
was too dazzling for their weak eyes, and therefore there was a necessity of a veil, not for the things
themselves, but the “weakness of their eyes.”451 The carnal affections of that people sunk down into the
things themselves; stuck in the outward pomp, and pierced not through the veil to the spiritual intent of
them; and by the use of them without rational conceptions, they besotted their minds and became
senseless of those spiritual motions required of them. Hence came all their expectations of a carnal
Messiah; the veil of ceremonies was so thick, and the film upon their eyes so condensed, that they could
not look through the veil to the Spirit of Christ; they beheld not the heavenly Canaan for the beauty of the
earthly; nor minded the regeneration of the spirit, while they rested upon the purifications of the flesh; the
prevalency of sense and sensitive affections diverted their minds from inquiring into the intent of them.
Sense and matter are often clogs to the mind, and sensible objects are the same often to spiritual motions.
Our souls are never more raised than when they are abstracted from the entanglements of them. A
pompous worship, made up of many sensible objects, weakens the spirituality of religion. Those that are
most zealous for outward, are usually most cold and indifferent in inward observances; and those that
overdo in carnal modes, usually underdo in spiritual affections. This was the Jewish state.452 The nature of
the ceremonies being pompous and earthly by their show and beauty, meeting with their weakness and
childish affections, filled their eyes with an outward lustre, allured their minds and detained them from
seeking things higher and more spiritual; the kernel of those rights lay concealed in a thick shell; the
spiritual glory was little seen, and the spiritual sweetness little tasted. Unless the Scripture be diligently
searched, it seems to transfer the worship of God from the true faith and the spiritual motions of the heart,
and stake it down to outward observances, and the opus operatum. Besides, the voice of the law did only
declare sacrifices, and invited the worshippers to them with a promise of the atonement of sin, turning
away the wrath of God. It never plainly acquainted them that those things were types and shadows of
something future; that they were only outward purifications of the flesh; it never plainly told them, at the
time of appointing them, that those sacrifices could not abolish sin, and reconcile them to God. Indeed, we
see more of them since their death and dissection, in that one Epistle to the Hebrews, than can be
discerned in the five books of loses. Besides, man naturally affects a carnal life, and therefore affects a
carnal worship; he designs the gratifying his sense, and would have a religion of the same nature. Most
men have no mind to busy their reasons about the things of sense, and are naturally unwilling to raise
them up to those things which are allied to the spiritual nature of God; and therefore the more spiritual
any ordinance is, the more averse is the heart of man to it. There is a simplicity of the gospel from which
our minds are easily corrupted by things that pleasure the sense, as Eve was by the curiosity of her ayes,
and the liquorishness of her palate.453 From this principle hath sprung all the idolatry in the world. The
Jews knew they had a God who had delivered them, but they would have a sensible God to go before
them;454 and the papacy at this day is a witness of the truth of this natural corruption.
</p>
<p>
    4. Upon these accounts, therefore, God never testified himself well pleased with that kind of worship.
He was not displeased with them, as they were his own institution, and ordained for the representing
(though in an obscure manner) the glorious things of the gospel; nor was he offended with those people’s
observance of them; for, since he had commanded them, it was their duty to perform them, and their sin to
neglect them; but he was displeased with them as they were practiced by them, with souls as morally
carnal in the practices, as the ceremonies were materially carnal in their substance. It was not their
disobedience to observe them; but it was a disobedience, and a contempt of the end of the institution to
rest apon them; to be warm in them, and cold in morals; they fed upon the bone and neglected the
marrow; pleased themselves with the shell, and sought not for the kernel; they joined not with them the
internal worship of God; fear of him, with faith in the promised Seed, which lay veiled under those
coverings (Hos. 6:6); “I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-
offerings;” and therefore he seems sometimes weary of his own institutions, and calls them not his own,
but their sacrifices, their feasts (Isa. 1:11, 14): they were his by appointment, theirs by abuse; the
institution was from his goodness and condescension, therefore his; the corruption of them was from the
vice of their nature, therefore theirs. He often blamed them for their carnality in them; showed his dislike
of placing all their religion in them; gives the sacrificers, on that account, no better a title than that of the
princes of Sodom and Gomorrah;455 and compares the sacrifices themselves to the “cutting off a dog’s
neck,” “swine’s blood,” and “the murder of a man.”456 And indeed God never valued them, or expressed
any delight in them; he despised the feasts of the wicked (Amos 5:21); and had no esteem for the material
offerings of the godly (Psalm 50:13): “Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?” which he
speaks to his saints and people, before he comes to reprove the wicked; which he begins (ver. 16), “But to
the wicked, God said,” &amp;c. So slightly he esteems them, that he seems to disown them to be any part of
his command, when he brought his people out of the land of Egypt (Jer. 7:21): “I spake not to your
fathers, nor commanded them concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices.” He did not value and regard
them, in comparison with that inward frame which he had required by the moral law; that being given
before the law of ceremonies, obliged them, in the first place, to an observance of those precepts. They
seemed to be below the nature of God, and could not of themselves please him. None could in reason
persuade themselves that the death of a beast was a proportionable offering for the sin of a man, or ever
was intended for the expiation of transgression. In the same rank are all our bodily services under the
gospel; a loud voice without spirit, bended bulrushes without inward affections, are no more delightful to
God, than the sacrifices of animals; it is but a change of one brute for another of a higher species; a mere
brute for that part of man which hath an agreement with brutes; such a service is a mere animal service,
and not spiritual.
</p>
<p>
     5. And therefore God never intended that sort of worship to be durable, and had often mentioned the
change of it for one more spiritual. It was not good or evil in itself; whatsoever goodness it had was solely
derived to it by institution, and therefore it was mutable. It had no conformity with the spiritual nature of
God who was to be worshipped, nor with the rational nature of man who was to worship; and therefore he
often speaks of taking away the new moons, and feasts, and sacrifices, and all the ceremonial worship, as
things he took no pleasure in, to have a worship more suited to his excellent nature; but he never speaks of
removing the gospel administration, and the worship prescribed there, as being more agreeable to the
nature and perfections of God, and displaying them more illustriously to the world. The apostle tells us, it
was to be “disannulled because of its weakness;”457 a determinate time was fixed for its duration, till the
accomplishment of the truth figured under that pedagogy.458 Some of the modes of that worship being
only typical, must naturally expire and be insignificant in their use, upon the finishing of that by the
Redeemer, which they did prefigure: and other parts of it, though God suffered them so long, because of
the weakness of the worshipper, yet because it became not God to be always worshipped in that manner,
he would reject them, and introduce another more spiritual and elevated. “Incense and a pure offering”
should be offered everywhere unto his name.459 He often told them he would make a “new covenant by
the Messiah,” and the old should be rejected;460 that the “former things should not be remembered, and
the things of old no more considered,” when he should do “a new thing in the earth.”461 Even the ark of
the covenant, the symbol of his presence, and the glory of the Lord in that nation, should not any more be
remembered and visited;462 that the temple and sacrifices should be rejected, and others established; that.
the order of the Aaronical priesthood should be abolished, and that of Melchizedek set up in the stead of
it, in the person of the Messiah, to endure forever ;463 that Jerusalem should be changed; a new heaven
and earth created; a worship more conformable to heaven, more advantageous to earth. God had
proceeded in the removal of some parts of it, before the time of taking down the whole furniture of this
house; the pot of manna was lost; Urim and Thummim ceased; the glory of the temple was diminished;
and the ignorant people wept at the sight of the one, without raising their faith and hopa in the
consideration of the other, which was promised to be filled with a spiritual glory. And as soon as ever the
gospel was spread in the world, God thundered out his judgments upon that place in which he had fixed
all those legal observances; so that the Jews, in the letter and flesh, could never practise the main part of
their worship, since they were expelled from that place where it was only to be celebrated. It is one
thousand six hundred years since they have been deprived of their altar, which was the foundation of all
the Levitical worship, and have wandered in the world without a sacrifice, a prince, or priest, an ephod or
teraphim.464 And God fully put an end to it in the command he gave to the apostles, and in them to us, in
the presence of Moses and Elias, to hear his Son only (Matt. 17:5): “Behold a voice out of the cloud,
which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” And at the death of our
Saviour, testified it to that whole nation and the world, by the rending in twain the veil of the temple. The
whole frame of that service, which was carnal, and, by reason of the corruption of man, weakened, is
nulled; and a spiritual worship is made known to the world, that we might now serve God in a more
spiritual manner, and with more spiritual frames.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. VI. The service and worship the gospel settles is spiritual, and the performance of it more
spiritual. Spirituality is the genius of the gospel, as carnality was of the law; the gospel is therefore called
spirit; we are abstracted from the employments of sense, and brought nearer to a heavenly state. The Jews
had angels’ bread poured upon them; we have angels’ service prescribed to us, the praises of God,
communion with God in spirit, through his Son Jesus Christ, and stronger foundations for spiritual
affections. It is called a “reasonable service;”465 it is suited to a rational nature, though it finds no
friendship from the corruption of reason. It prescribes a service fit for the reasonable faculties of the soul,
and advanceth them while it employs them. The word reasonable may be translated “word-service,”466 as
well as reasonable service; an evangelical service, in opposition to a law service. All evangelical service is
reasonable, and all truly reasonable service is evangelical.
</p>
<p>
     The matter of the worship is spiritual; it consists in love of God, faith in God, recourse to his
goodness, meditation on him, and communion with him. It lays aside the ceremonial, spiritualizeth the
moral. The commands that concerned our duty to God, as well as those that concerned our duty to our
neighbor, were reduced by Christ to their spiritual intention. The motives are spiritual; it is a state of more
grace, as well as of more truth,467 supported by spiritual promises, beaming out in spiritual privileges;
heaven comes down in it to earth, to spiritualize earth for heaven. The manner of worship is more
spiritual; higher flights of the soul, stronger ardors of affection, sincerer aims at his glory; mists are
removed from our minds, clogs from the soul, more of love than fear; faith in Christ kindles the
affections, and works by them. The assistances to spiritual worship are greater. The Spirit doth not drop,
but is plentifully poured out. It doth not light sometimes upon, but dwells in the heart. Christ suited the
gospel to a spiritual heart, and the Spirit changeth the carnal heart to make it fit for a spiritual gospel. He
blows upon the garden, and causes the spices to flow forth; and often makes the soul in worship like the
chariots of Aminadab, in a quick and nimble motion. Our blessed Lord and Saviour, by his eath,
discovered to us the nature of God; and after his ascension sent his Spirit to fit us for the worship of God,
and converse with him. One spiritual evangelical believing breath is more delightful to God than millions
of altars made up of the richest pearls, and smoking with the costliest oblations, because it is spiritual; and
a mite of spirit is of more worth than the greatest weight of flesh: one holy angel is more excellent than a
whole world of mere bodies.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. VII. Yet the worship of God with our bodies is not to be rejected upon the account that God
requires a spiritual worship. Though we must perform the weightier duties of the law, yet we are not to
omit and leave undone the lighter precepts, since both the magnalia and minutula legis, the greater and
the lesser duties of the law, have the stamp of divine authority upon them. As God under the ceremonial
law did not command the worship of the body and the observation of outward rites without the
engagement of the apirit, so neitlier doth he command that of the spirit without the peculiar attendance of
the body. The Schwelksendians denied bodily worship; and the indecent postures of many in public
attendance intimate no great care either of composing their bodies or spirits. A morally discomposed body
intimates a tainted heart. Our bodies as well as our spirits are to be presented to God.468 Our bodies in lieu
of the sacrifices of beasts, as in the Judaical institutions; body for the whole man; a living sacrifice, not to
be slain, as the beasts were, but living a new life, in a holy posture, with crucified affections. This is the
inference the apostle makes of the privileges of justification, adoption, co-heirship with Christ, which he
before discoursed of; privileges conferred upon the person, and not upon a part of man.
</p>
<p>
    1. Bodily worship is due to God. He hath a right to an adoration by our bodies, as they are his by
creation; his right is not diminished, but increased, by the blessing of redemption: (1 Cor. 6:20) “For you
are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your bodies and your spirits, which are God’s.” The
body, as well as the spirit, is redeemed, since our Saviour suffered crucifixion in his body, as well as
agonies in his soul. Body is not taken here for the whole man, as it may be in Rom 12; but for the material
part of our nature, it being distinguished from the spirit. If we are to render to God an obedience with our
bodies, we are to render him such acts of worship with our bodies as they are capable of. As God is the
Father of spirits, so he is the God of all flesh; therefore the flesh he hath framed of the earth, as well as the
noble portion he hath breathed into us, cannot be denied him without a palpable injustice. The service of
the body we must not deny to God, unless we will deny him to be the author of it, and the exercise of his
providential care about it. The mercies of God are renewed every day upon our bodies as well as our
souls, and, therefore, they ought to express a fealty to God for his bounty everyday. “Both are from God;
both should be for God. Man consists of body and soul; the service of man is the service of both. The
body is to be sanctified as well as the soul; and, therefore, to be offered to God as well as the soul. Both
are to be glorified, both are to glorify. As our Saviour’s divinity was manifested in his body, so should our
spirituality in ours. To give God the service of the body and not of the soul, is hypocrisy; to give God the
service of the spirit and not of the body, is sacrilege; to give him neither, atheism.”469 If the only part of
man that is visible were exempted from the service of Goa, there could be no visible testimonies of piety
given upon any occasion. Since not a moiety of man, but the whole is God’s creature, he ought to pay a
homage with the whole, and not only with a moiety of himself.
</p>
<p>
    2. Worship in societies is due to God, but this cannot be without some bodily expressions. The law of
nature doth as much direct men to combine together in public societies for the acknowledgment of God,
as in civil communities for self-preservation and order; and a notice of a society for religion is more
ancient than the mention of civil associations for politic government (Gen. 4:26): “Then began men to call
upon the name of the Lord,” viz., in the time of Seth. No question but Adam had worshipped God before,
as well as Abel, and a family religion had been preserved; but, as mankind increased in distinct families,
they knit together in companies to solemnize the worship of God.470 Hence, as some think, those that
incorporated together for such ends, were called the “sons of God;” sons by profession, though not sons
by adoption; as those of Corinth were saints by profession, though in such a corrupted church they could
not be all so by regeneration; yet saints, as being of a Christian society, and calling upon the name of
Christ, that is, worshipping God in Christ, though they might not be all saints in spirit and practice. So
Cain and Abel met together to worship (Gen. 4:3) “at the end of the days,” at a set time. God settled a
public worship among the Jews, instituted synagogues for their convening together, whence called the
“synagogues of God.”471 The Sabhath was instituted to acknowledge God a common benefactor. Public
worship keeps up the memorials of God in a world prone to atheism, and a sense of God in a heart prone
to forgetfulness. The angels sung in company, not singly, at the birth of Christ,472 and praised God not
only with a simple elevation of their spiritual nature, but audibly, by forming a voice in the air. Affections
are more lively, spirits more raised in public than private; God will credit his own ordinance. Fire
increaseth by laying together many coals on one place; so is devotion inflamed by the union of many
hearts, and by a joint presence; nor can the approach of the last day of judgment, or particular judgments
upon a nation, give a writ of ease from such assemblies. (Heb. 10:25): “Not forsaking the assembling
ourselves together; but so much the more as you see the day approaching.” Whether it be understood of
the day of judgment, or the day of the Jewish destruction and the Christian persecution, the apostle uses it
as an argument to quicken them to the observance, not to encourage them to a neglect. Since, therefore,
natural light informs us, and divine institution commands us, publicly to acknowledge ourselves the
servants of God, it implies the service of the body. Such acknowledgments cannot be without visible
testimonies, and outward exercises of devotion, as well as inward affections. This promotes God’s honor,
checks others’ profaneness, allures men to the same expressions of duty; and though there may be
hypocrisy and an outward garb without an inward frame, yet better a moiety of worship than none at all;
better acknowledge God’s right in one than disown it in both.
</p>
<p>
    3. Jesus Christ, the most spiritual worshipper, worshipped God with his body. He prayed orally, and
kneed, “Father, if it be thy will,”473 &amp;c. He blessed with his mouth, “Father, I thank thee.”474 He lifted up
his eyes as well as elevated his spirit, when he praised his Father for mercy received, or begged for the
blessings his disciples wanted.475 The strength of the spirit must have vent at the outward members. The
holy men of God have employed the body in significant expressions of worship; Abraham in falling on
his face, Paul in kneeling, emptoying their tongues, lifting up their hands. Though Jacob was bed-rid, yet
he would not worship God without some devout expression of reverence; it is in one place “leaning upon
his staff”476 in another, “bowing himself upon his bed’s head.”477 The reason of the diversity is in the
Hebrew word, which, without vowels, may be read mittah, a bed, or matteh, a staff; however, both signify
a testimony of adoration by a reverent gesture of the body. Indeed, in angels and separated souls, a
worship is performed purely by the spirit; but while the soul is in conjunction with the body, it can hardly
perform a serious act of worship without some tincture upon the outward man and reverential composure
of the body. Fire cannot be in the clothes but it will be felt by the members, nor flames be pent up in the
soul without bursting out in the body. The heart can no more restrain itself from breaking out, than Joseph
could inclose his affections without expressing them in tears to his brethren.478 “We believe, and therefore
speak.”479
</p>
<p>
    To conclude: God hath appointed some parts of worship which cannot be performed without the body,
as sacraments; we have need of them because we are not wholly spiritual and incorporeal creatures. The
religion which consists in externals only is not for an intellectual nature; a worship purely intellectual is
too sublime for a nature allied to sense, and depending much upon it. The christian mode of worship is
proportioned to both; it makes the sense to assist the mind, and elevates the spirit above the sense. Bodily
worship helps the spiritual: the members of the body reflect back upon the heart, the voice bars
distractions, the tongue sets the heart on fire in good as well as in evil. It is as much against the light of
nature to serve God without external significations, as to serve him. only with them without the intention
of the mind. As the invisible God declares himself to men by visible works and signs, so should we
declare our invisible frames by visible expressions. God hath given us a soul and body in conjunction; and
we are to serve him in the same manner he hath framed us.
</p>
<p>
    II. The second thing I am to show is, what spiritual worship is. In general, the whole spirit is to be
employed; the name of God is not sanctified but by the engagement of our souls. Worship is an act of the
understanding, applying itself to the knowledge of the excellency of God and actual thoughts of his
majesty; recognizing him as the supreme Lord and Governor of the world, which is natural knowledge;
beholding the glory of his attributes in the Redeemer, which is evangelical knowledge. This is the sole act
of the spirit of man. The same reason is for all our worship as for our thanksgiving. This must be done
with understanding: (Psalm 47:7) “Sing ye praise with understanding;” with a knowledge and sense of his
greatness, goodness, and wisdom. It is also an act of the will, whereby the soul adores and reverences his
majesty, is ravished with his amiableness, embraceth his goodness, enters itself into an intimate
communion with this most lovely object, and pitcheth all his affections upon him. We must worship God
understandingly; it is not else a reasonable service. The nature of God and the law of God abhor a blind
offering; we must worship. him heartily, else we offer him a dead sacrifice. A reasonable service is that
wherein the mind doth truly act something with God. All spiritual acts must be acts of reason, otherwise
they are not human acts, because they want that principle which is constitutive of man, and doth
difference him from other creatures. Acts done only by sense are the acts of a brute; acts done by reason
are the acts of a man. That which is only an act of sense cannot be an act of religion. The sense, without
the conduct of reason, is not the subject of religious acts; for then beasts were capable of religion as well
as men. There cannot be religion where here is not reason; and there cannot be the exercise of religion
where there is not an exercise of the rational faculties; nothing can be a christian act that is not a human
act. Besides, all worship must be for some end; the worship of God must be for God. It is by the exercise
of our rational faculties that we only can intend an end. An ignorant and carnal worship is a brutish
worship. Particularly,
</p>
<p>
    1. Spiritual worship is a worship from a spiritual nature. Not only physically spiritual, so our souls are
in their frame; but morally spiritual, by a renewing principle. The heart must be first cast into the mould
of the gospel, before it can perform a worship required by the gospel. Adam living in Paradise might
perform a spiritual worship; but Adam fallen from his rectitude could not we, being heirs of his nature, are
heirs of his impotence. Restoration to a spiritual life must precede any act of spiritual worship. As no
work can be good, so no worship can be spiritual, till we are created in Christ.480 Christ is our life.481 As
no natural action can be performed without life in the root or heart, so no spiritual act without Christ in
the soul. Our being in Christ is as necessary to every spiritual act as the union of our soul with our body is
necessary to natural action. Nothing can exceed the limits of its nature; for then it should exceed itself in
acting, and do that which it hath no principle to do. A beast cannot act like a man, without partaking of the
nature of a man; nor a man act like an angel, without partaking of the angelical nature. How can we
perform spiritual acts without a spiritual principle? Whatsoever worship proceeds from the corrupted
nature, cannot deserve the title of spiritual worship, because it springs not from a spiritual habit. If those
that are evil cannot speak good things, those that are carnal cannot offer a spiritual service. Poison is the
fruit of a viper’s nature (Matt. 12:34): “O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good
things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” As the root is, so is the fruit. If the soul
be habitually carnal, the worship cannot be actually spiritual. There may be an intention of spirit, but there
is no spiritual principle as a root of that intention. A heart may be sensibly united with a duty, when it is
not spiritually united with Christ in it. Carnal motives and carnal ends may fix the mind in an act of
worship, as the sense of some pressing affliction may enlarge a man’s mind in prayer. Whatsoever is
agreeable to the nature of God must have a stamp of Christ upon it; a stamp of his grace in performance,
as well as of his mediation in the acceptance. The apostle lived not, but Christ lived in him;482 the soul
worships not, but Christ in him. Not that Christ performs the act of worship, but enables us spiritually to
worship, after he enables us spiritually to live. As God counts not any soul living but in Christ, so he
counts not any a spiritual worshipper but in Christ. The goodness and fatness of the fruit come from the
fatness of the olive wherein we are engrafted. We must find healing in Christ’s wings, before God can
find spirituality in our services. All worship issuing from a dead nature is but a dead service. A living
action cannot be performed, without being knit to a living root.
</p>
<p>
    2. Spiritual worship is done by the influence and with the assistance of the Spirit of God. A heart may
be spiritual, when a particular act of worship may not be spiritual. The Spirit may dwell in the heart, when
ha may suspend his influence on the act. Our worship is then spiritual, when the fire that kindles our
affections comes from heaven, as that fire upon the altar wherewith the sacrifices were consumed. God
tastes a sweetness in no service, but as it is dressed up by the hand of the Mediator, and hath the air of his
own Spirit in it; they are but natural acts, without a supernatural assistance; without an actual influence,
we cannot act from spiritual motives, nor for spiritual ends, nor in a spiritual manner. We cannot mortify a
lust without the Spirit,483 nor quicken a service without the Spirit. Whatsoever corruption is killed, is slain
by his power; whatsoever duty is spiritualiaed, is refined by his breath. He quickens our dead bodies in
our resurrection;484 he renews our dead souls in our regeneration; he quickens our carnal services in our
adorations; the choicest acts of worship are but infirmities without his auxiliary help.485 We are logs,
unable to move ourselves, till he raise our faculties to a pitch agreeable to God; puts his hand to the duty,
and lifts that up and us with it. Never any great act was preformed by the apostles to God, or for God; but
they are said to filled with the Holy Ghost. Christ could not have been conceived immaculate as that “holy
thing,” without the Spirit’s overshadowing the Virgin; nor any spiritual act conceived in our heart,
without the Spirit’s moving upon us, to bring forth a living religion from us. The acts of worship are said
to be in the Spirit, “suplacation in the Spirit;”486 not only with the strength and affection of our own
spirits, but with the mighty operation of the Holy Ghost, if Jude may be the interpreter;487 the Holy Ghost
exciting us, impelling us, and firing our souls by his divine flame; raising up the affections, and making
the soul cry with a holy importunity, Abba, Father. To render our worship spiritual, we should, before
every engagement in it, implore the actual presence of the Spirit, without which we are not able to send
forth one spiritual breath or groan; but be wind-bound like a ship without a gale, and our worship be no
better than carnal. How doth the spouse solicit the Spirit with an “Awake, O north wind, and come, thou
south wind,”488 &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
     3. Spiritual worship is done with sincerity. When the heart stands right to God, and the soul performs
what it pretends to perform; when we serve God with our spirits, as the apostle (Rom. 1:9), “God is my
witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son:” this is not meant of the Holy Ghost; for
the apostle would never have called the Spirit of God his own spirit; but with my spirit, that is, a sincere
frame of heart. A carnal worship, whether under the law or gospel, is, when we are busied about external
rites, without an inward compliance of soul. God demands the heart; “My son, give me thy heart;”489 not
give me thy tongue, or thy lips, or thy hands; these may be given without the heart, but the heart can never
be bestowed without these as its attendants. A heap of services can be no more welcome to God, without
our spirits, than all Jacob’s sons could be to Joseph, without the Benjamin he desired to see. God is not
taken with the cabinet, but the jewel; he first respected Abel’s faith and sincerity, and then his sacrifice;
he disrespected Cain’s infidelity and hypocrisy, and then his offering. For this cause he rejected the
offerings of the Jews, the prayers of the Pharisees, and the alms of Ananias and Sapphira, because their
hearts and their duties were at a distance from one another. In all spiritual sacrifices, our spirits are God’s
portion. Under the law, the reins were to be consumed by the fire on the altar, because the secret
intentions of the heart were signified by them (Psalm 7:9), “The Lord trieth the heart and the reins.” It was
an ill omen among the heathen, if a victim wanted a heart. The widow’s mites, with her heart in them,
were more esteemed than the richer offerings without it.490 Not the quantity of service, but the will in it, is
of account with this infinite Spirit. All that was to be brought for the framing of the tabernacle was to be
offered “willingly with the heart.”491 The more of will, the more of spirituality and acceptableness to God
(Psalm 119:108), “Accept the free-will offering of my lips.” Sincerity is the salt which seasons every
sacrifice. The heart is most like to the object of worship; the heart in the body is the spring of all vital
actions; and a spiritual soul is the spring of all spiritual actions. How can we imagine God can delight in
the mere service of the body, any more than we can delight in converse with a carcass? Without the heart
it is no worship; it is a stage play; an acting a part without being that person really which is acted by us: a
hypocrite, in the notion of the word, is a stage-player. We may as well say a man may believe with his
body, as worship God only with his body. Faith is a great ingredient in worship; and it is “with the heart
man believes unto righteousness.”492 We may be truly said to worship God, though we want perfection;
but we cannot be said to worship him, if we want sincerity; a statue upon a tomb, with eyes and hands
lifted up, offers as good and true a service; it wants only a voice, the gestures and postures are the same;
nay, the service is better; it is not a mockery; it represents all that it can be framed to; but to worship
without our spirits, is a presenting God with a picture, an echo, voice, and nothing else; a compliment; a
mere lie; a “compassing him about with lies.”493 Without the heart the tongue is a liar; and the greatest
zeal a dissembling with him. To present the spirit, is to present with that which can never naturally die; to
present him only the body, is to present him that which is every day crumbling to dust, and will at last lie
rotting in the grave; to offer him a few rags, easily torn; a skin for a sacrifice, a thing unworthy the
majesty of God; a fixed eye and elevated hands, with a sleepy heart and earthly soul, are pitiful things for
an ever-blessed and glorious Spirit: nay, it is so far from being spiritual, that it is biasphemy; to pretend to
be a Jew outwardly, without being so inwardly, is, in the judgment of Christ, to blaspheme.494 And is not
the same title to be given with as much reason to those that pretend a worship and perform none? Such a
one is not a spiritual worshipper, but a blaspheming devil in Samuel’s mantle.
</p>
<p>
     4. Spiritual worship is performed with an unitedness of heart. The heart is not only now and then with
God, but “united to fear or worship his name.”495 A spiritual duty must have the engagement of the spirit,
and the thoughts tied up to the spiritual object. The union of all the parts of the heart together with the
body is the life of the body; and the moral union of our hearts is the life of any duty. A heart quickly
flitting from God makes not God his treasure; he slights the worship, and therein affronts the object of
worship. All our thoughts ought to be ravished with God; bound up in him as in a bundle of life; but when
we start from him to gaze after every feather, and run after every bubble, we disown a full and affecting
excellency, and a satisfying sweetness in him. When our thoughts run from God, it is a testimony we have
no spiritual affection to God; affection would stake down the thoughts to the object affected; it is but a
mouth love, as the prophet praiseth it;496 but their hearts go “after their covetousness;” covetous objects
pipe, and the heart danceth after them; and thoughts of God are shifted oft to receive a multitude of other
imaginations; the heart and the service staid awhile together, and then took leave of one another. The
Psalmist497 still found his heart with God when he awaked; still with God in spiritual affections and fixed
meditations. A carnal heart is seldom with God, either in or out of worship; if God should knock at the
heart in any duty, it would be found not at home, but straying abroad. Our worship is spiritual when the
door of the heart is shut against all intruders, as our Saviour commands in closet-duties.498 It was not his
meaning to command the shutting the closet-door, and leave the heart-door open for every thought that
would be apt to haunt us. Worldly affections are to be laid aside if we would have our worship spiritual;
this was meant by the Jewish custom of wiping or washing off the dust of their feet before their entrance
into the temple, and of not bringing move in their girdles. To be spiritual in worship, is to have our sons
gathered and bound up wholly in themselves, and offered to God. Our loins must be girt, as the fashion
was in the eastern countries, where they wore long garments, that they might not waver with the wind,
and be blown between their legs, to obstruct them in their travel: our faculties must not hang loose about
us. He is a carnal worshipper that gives God but a piece of his heart, as well as he that denies him the
whole of it; that hath some thoughts pitched upon God in worship, and as many willingly upon the world.
David sought God, not with a moiety of his heart, but with his “whole heart;” with his entire frame;499 he
brought not half his heart, and left the other in the possession of another master. It was a good lesson
Pythagoras gave his scholars,500 “Not to make the observance of God a work by the bye.” If those guests
be invited, or entertained kindly, or if they come unexpected, the spirituality of that worship is lost; the
soul kicks down what it wrought before: but if they be brow-beaten by us, and our grief rather than our
pleasure, they divert our spiritual intention from the work in hand, but hinder not God’s acceptance of it
as spiritual, because they are not the acts of our will, but offences to our wills.
</p>
<p>
     5. Spiritual worship is performed with a spiritual activity, and sensibleness of God; with an active
understanding to meditate on his excellency, and an active will to embrace him when he drops upon the
soul. If we understand the amiableness of God, our affections will be ravished; if we understand the
immensity of his goodness, our spirits will be enlarged. We are to act with the highest intention suitable to
the greatness of that God with whom we have to do (Psalm 150:2): “Praise him according to his excellent
greatness;” not that we can worship him equally, but in some proportion the frame of the heart is to be
suite to the excellency of the object; our spiritual strength is to be put out to the utmost, as creatures that
act naturally do. The sun shines, and the fire burns to the utmost of their natural power. This is so
necessary, that David, a spiritual worshipper, prays for it before he sets upon acts of adoration (Psalm
80:18): “Quicken us, that we may call upon thy name;” as he was loth to have a drowsy faculty, he was
loth to have a drowsy instrument, and would willingly have them as lively as himself (Psalm 57:8):
“Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.” How would this divine soul
screw himself up to God, and be turned into nothing but a holy flame! Our souls must be boiling hot when
we serve the Lord.501 The heart doth no less burn when it spiritually comes to God, than when God doth
spiritually approach to it;502 a Nabal’s heart, one as cold as a stone, cannot offer up a spiritual service.
Whatsoever is enjoined us as our duty, ought to be performed with the greatest intenseness of our spirit.
As it is our dnty to pray, so it is our duty to pray with the most fervent importunity. It is our duty to love
God, but with the purest and most sublime affections; every command of God requires the whole strength
of the creature to be employed in it. That love to God wherein all our duty to God is summed up, is to be
with all our strength, with all our might, &amp;c.503 Though in the covenant of grace he hath mitigated the
severity of the law, and requires not from us such an elevation of our affections as was possible in the
state of in nocence, yet God requires of us the utmost moral industry to raise our affections to a pitch, at
least equal to what they are in other things. What strength of affection we naturally have, ought to be as
much and more excited in acts of worship, than upon other occasions and our ordinary works. As there
was an inactivity of soul in worship, and a quickness to sin, when sin had the dominion; so when the soul
is spiritualized, the temper is changed; there is an in activity to sin, and an ardor in duty; the more the soul
is “dead to sin,” the more it is “alive to God,”504 and the more lively too in all that concerns God and his
honor; for grace being a new strength added to our natural, determines the affections to new objects, and
excites them to a greater vigor. And as the hatred of sin is more sharp, the love to everything that destroys
the dominion of it is more strong; and acts of worship may be reckoned as the chiefest batteries against
the power of this inbred enemy. When the Spirit is in the soul, like the rivers of waters flowing out of the
belly, the soul hath the activity of a river, and makes haste to be swallowed up in God, as the streams of
the river in the sea. Christ makes his people “kings and priests to God;”505 first kings, then priests; gives
first a royal, temper of heart, that they may offer spiritual sacrifices as priests, kings and priests to God,
acting with a magnificent spirit in all their motions to him. We cannot be spiritual priests, till we be
spiritual kings. The Spirit apgeared in the likeness of fire, and where he resides, communicates, like fire,
purity and activity. Dulness is against the light of nature. I do not remember that the heathen ever offered
a snail to any of their false deities, nor an ass, but to Priapus, their unclean idol; but the Persians sacrificed
to the sun a horse, a swift and generous creature. God provided against those in the law, commanding an
ass’ firstling, the offspring of a sluggish creature, to be redeemed, or his neck broke, but by no means to
be offered to him.506 God is a Spirit infinitely active, and therefore frozen and benumbed frames are
unsuitable to him; he “rides upon a cherub” and flies; he comes upon the “wings of the wind;” he rides
upon a “swift cloud;”507 and therefore demands of us not a dull reason, but an active spirit. God is a living
God, and therefore must have a lively service. Christ is life, and slothful adorations are not fit to be
offered up in the name of life. The worship of God is called wrestling in Scripture; and Paul was a striver
in the service of his Master,508 “in an agony.”509 Angels worshipped God spiritually with their wings on;
and when God commands them to worship Christ, the next Scripture quoted is, that he makes them
“flames of fire.”510 If it be thus, how may we charge ourselves? What Paul said of the sensual widow,511
that she is “dead while she lives,” we may say often of ourselves, we are dead while we worship. Our
hearts are in duty as the Jews were in deliverances, as those “in a dream;”512 by which unexpectedness
God showed the greatness of his care and mercy; and we attend him as men in a dream, whereby we
discover our negligence and folly. This activity doth: not consist in outward acts; the body may be hot,
and the heart may be faint, but in an inward stirring, meltings, flights. In the highest raptures the body is
most insensible. Strong spiritual affections are abstracted from outward sense.
</p>
<p>
     6. Spiritual worship is performed with acting spiritual habits. When all the living springs of grace are
opened, as the fountains of the deep were in the deluge, the soul and all that is within it, all the spiritual
impresses of God upon it, erect themselves to “bless his holy name.”513 This is necessary to make a
worship spiritual. As natural agents are determined to act suitable to their proper nature, so rational agents
are to act conformable to a rational being. When there is a conformity between the act and the nature
whence it flows, it is a good act in its kind; if it be rational, it is a good rational act, because suitable to its
principle; as a man endowed, with reason must act suitable to that endowment, and exercise his reason in
his acting; so a Christian endued with grace, must act suitable to that nature, and exercise his grace in his
acting. Acts done by a natural inclination are no more human acts than the natural acts of a beast may be
said to be human; though they are the acts of a man, as he is the efficient cause of them, yet they are not
human acts, be, cause they arise not from that principle of reason which denominates him a man. So acts
of worship performed by a bare exercise of reason, are not christian and spiritual acts, because they come
not from the principle which constitutes him a Christian; reason is not the principle, for then all rational
creatures would be Christians. They ought, therefore, to be acts of a higher principle, exercises of that
grace whereby Christians are what they are; not but that rational acts in worship are due to God, for
worship is due from us as men, and we are settled in that rank of being by our reason. Grace doth not
exclude reason, but ennobles it, and calls it up to another form; but we must not rest in a bare rational
worship, but exert that principle whereby we are Christians. To worship God with our reason, is to
worship him as men; to worship God with our grace is to worship him as Christians, and so spiritually;
but to worship him only with our bodies, is no better than brutes. Our desires of the word are to issue from
the regenerate principle (1 Pet. 2:2): “As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word;” it seems to
be not a comparison, but a restriction. All worship must have the same spring, and be the exercise of that
principle, otherwise we can have no communion with God. Friends that have the same habitual
dispositions, have a fundamental fitness for an agreeable converse with one another; but if the temper
wherein their likeness consists be languishing, and the string out of tune, there is not an actual fitness; and
the present indisposition breaks the converse, and renders the company troublesome. Though we may
have the habitual graces which compose in us a resemblance to God, yet for want of acting those suitable
dispositions, we render ourselves unfit for his converse, and make the worship, which is fundamentally
spiritual, to become actually carnal. As the will cannot naturally;act to any object but by the exercise of its
affections, so the heart cannot spiritually act towards God but by the exercise of graces. This is God’s
music (Eph. 5:19): “Singing and making melody to God in your hearts.” Singing and all other acts of
worship are outward, but the spiritual melody is “by grace in the heart” (Col. 3:16): this renders it a
spiritual worship; for it is an effect of the fulness of the spirit in the soul, as (ver. 19), “But be filled with
the Spirit.” The overflowing of the Spirit in the heart, setting the soul of a believer thus on work to make a
spiritual melody to God, shows that something higher than bare reason is put in tune in the heart. Then is
the fruit of the garden pleasant to Christ, when the Holy Spirit, “the north and south wind, blow upon the
spices,” and strike out the fragrancy of them.514 Since God is the Author of graces, and bestows them to
have a glory from them, they are best employed about him and his service. It is fit he should have the
cream of his own gifts. Without the exercise of grace we perform but a work of nature, and offer him a
few dry bones without marrow. The whole set of graces must be one way or other exercised. If any treble
be wanting in a lute, there will be great defect, in the music. If any one spirital string be dull, the spiritual
harmony of worship will be spoiled. And therefore;
</p>
<p>
    1. Faith must be acted in worship; a confidence in God. A natural worship cannot be performed
without a natural confidence in the goodness of God; whosoever comes to him, must regard him as a
rewarder, and a faithful Creator.515 A spiritual worship cannot be performed without an evangelical
confidence in him as a gracious Redeemer. To think him a tyrant, meditating revenge, damps the soul; to
regard him as a gracious king, full of tender bowels, spirits the affections to him. The mercy of God is the
proper object of trust (Psalm 33:18): “The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that
hope in his mercy.” The worship of God in the Old Testament is most described by fear; in the New
Testament by faith. Fear, or the worship of God, and hope in his mercy are lined together; when they go
hand in hand, the accepting eye of God is upon us; when we do not trust, we do not worship. Those of
Judah had the temple-worship among them, especially in Josiah’s tune (Zeph. 3:2), the time of that
prophecy; yet it was accounted no worship, because no trust in the worshippers. Interest in God cannot be
improved without an exercise of fait. The gospel-worship is prophesied of, to be a confidence in God, as
in a husband more than in a lord (Hos. 2:16): “Thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.”
“Thou shalt call me;” that is, thou shalt worship me, worship being often comprehended under invocation.
More confidence is to be exercised in a husband or father, than in a lord or master. If a man have not faith,
he is without Christ; and though a man be in Christ by the habit of faith, he performs a duty out of Christ
without an act of faith: without the habit of faith, our persons are out of Christ; and without the exercise of
faith, the duties are out of Christ. As the want of faith in a person is the death of the soul, so the want of
faith in a service is the death of the offering. Though a man were at the cost of an ox, yet to kill it without
bringing it to the “door of the tabernacle,” was not a sacrifice, but a murder (Lev. 17:3, 4). The tabernacle
was a type of Christ, and a look to him is necessary in every spiritual sacrifice. As there must be faith to
make any act an act of obedience, so there must be faith to make any act of worship spiritual. That service
is not spiritual that is not vital; and it cannot be vital without the exercise of a vital principle; all spiritual
life is “hid in Christ,” and drawn from him by faith (Gal. 2:20). Faith, as it hath relation to Christ, makes
every act of worship a living act, and, consequently, a spiritual act. Habitual unbelief cuts us off from the
body of Christ (Rom. 11:20): “Because of unbelief they were broken off;” and a want of actuated belief
breaks us off from a present communion with Christ in spirit. As unbelief in us hinders Christ from doing
any mighty work, so unbelief in us hinders us from doing any mighty spiritual duty; so that the exercise of
faith, and a confidence in God, is necessary to every duty.
</p>
<p>
     2. Love must be acted to render a worship spiritual. Though God commanded love in the Old
Testament, yet the manner of giving the law bespoke more of fear than love. The dispensation of the law
was with fire, thunder, &amp;c., proper to raise horror, and benumb the spirit; which effect it had upon the
Israelites, when they desired that God would speak no more to them. Grace is the genius of the gospel,
proper to excite the affection of love. The law was given by the “disposition of angels,” with signs to
amaze; the gospel was ushered in with the “songs of angels,” composed of peace and good-will,
calculated to ravish the soul. Instead of the terrible voice of the law, “Do this and live,” the comfortable
voice of the gospel is, “Grace, grace!” Upon this account the principle of the Old Testament was fear, and
the worship often expressed by the fear of God. The principle of the New Testament is love. The Mount
Sinai gendereth to bondage (Gal. 4:44); Mount Sion, from whence the gospel or evangelical law goes
forth, gendereth to libery; and therefore the “spirit of bondage unto fear,” as the property of the law, is
opposed to the state of adoption, the principle of love, as the property of the gospel (Rom. 8:15); and
therefore the worship of God under the gospel, or New Testament, is oftener expressed by love than fear,
as proceeding from higher principles, and acting nobler passions. In this state we are to serve him without
fear (Luke 1:74); without a bondage fear; not without a fear of unworthy treating him; with a “fear of his
goodness” as it is prophesied of (Hosea 9:5). Goodness is not the object of terror, but reverence; God, in
the law, had more the garb of a judge; in the gospel, of a father; the name of a father is sweeter and
bespoaks more of affection. As their services were with a feeling of the thunders of the law in their
consciences, so is our worship to be with a sense of gospel grace in our spirits; spiritual worship is that,
therefore, which is exercised with a spiritual and heavenly affection, proper to the gospel. The heart
should be enlarged according to the liberty the gospel gives of drawing near to God as a father. As he
gives us the nobler relation of children, we are to act the nobler qualities of children. Love should act
according to its nature, which is desired of union; desire of a moral union by affections, as well as a
mystical union by faith; as flame aspires to reach flame, and become one with it. In every act of worship
we should endeavor to be united to God, and become one spirit with him. This grace doth spiritualize
worship; in that one word, love, God hath wrapt up all the devotion he requires of us; it is the total sum of
the first table, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God:” it is to be acted in everything we do; but in worship
our hearts should more solemnly rise up and acknowledge him amiable and lovely, since the law is
stripped of its cursing power, and made sweet in the blood of the Redeemer. Love is a thing acceptable of
itself, but nothing acceptable without it; the gifts of one man to another are spiritualized by it. We would
not value a present without the affection of the nor; every man would lay claim to the love of others,
though he would not to their possessions. Love is God’s right in every service, and the noblest thing we
can bestow upon him in our adorations of him. God’s gifts to us are not so estimable without his love; nor
our services valuable by him without the exercise of a choice affection. Hezekiah regarded not his
deliverance without the love of the Deliverer; “In love to my soul thou hast delivered me” (Isa. 38:17). So
doth God say, In love to my honor thou hast worshipped me: so that love must be acted, to render our
worship spiritual.
</p>
<p>
    3. A spiritual sensibleness of our own weakness is necessary to make our worship spiritual. Affections
to God cannot be without relentings in ourselves. When the eye is spiritually fixed upon a spiritual God,
the heart will mourn that the worship is no more spiritually suitable. The more we act love upon God, as
amiable and gracious, the more we should exercise grief in ourselves, as we are vile and offending.
Spiritual worship is a melting worship, as well as an elevating worship; it exalts God, and debaseth the
creature. The Publican was more spiritual in his humble address to God, when the Pharisee was wholly
carnal with his swelling language. A spiritual love in worship will make us grieve that we have given him
so little, and could give him no more. It is a part of spiritual duty to bewail our carnality mixed with it; as
we receive mercies spiritually, when we receive them with a sense of God’s goodness and our own
vileness; in the same manner we render a spiritual worship.
</p>
<p>
    4. Spiritual desires for God render the service spiritual; when the soul “follows hard after him” (Psalm
3:8); pursues after God as a God of infinite and communicative goodness, with sighs and groans
unutterable. A spiritual soul seems to be transformed into hunger and thirst, and becomes nothing but
desire. A carnal worshipper is taken with the beauty and magnificence of the temple; a spiritual
worshipper desires to see the glory of God in the sanctuary (Psalm 3:2), he pants after God: as he came to
worship, to find God, he boils up in desires for God, and is loth to go from it without God, “the living
God” (Psalm 42:2). He would see the Urim and the Thummim; the unusual sparkling of the stones upon
the high-priest’s breast-plate. That deserves not the title of spiritual worship, when the soul makes no
longing inquiries: “Saw you him whom my soul loves?” A spiritual worship is when our desires are
chiefly for God in the worship; as David desires to dwell in the house of the Lord; but his desire is not
terminated there, but to behold the beauty of the Lord (Psalm 27:4), and taste the ravishing sweetness of
his presence. No doubt but Elijah’s desires for the enjoyment of God while he was mounting to heaven,
were as fiery as the chariot wherein he was carried. Unutterable groans acted in worship are the fruit of
the Spirit, and certainly render it a spiritual service (Rom. 8:26). Strong appetites are agreeable to God,
and prepare us to eat the fruit of worship. A spiritual Paul presseth forward to know Christ, and the power
of his resurrection; and a spiritual worshipper actually aspires in every duty to know God, and the power
of hia grace. To desire worship as an end is carnal; to desire it as a means, and act desires in it for
communion with God in it, is spiritual, and the fruit of a spiritual life.
</p>
<p>
    5. Thankfulness and admiration are to be exercised in spiritual service. This is a worship of spirits;
praise is the adoration of the blessed angels (Isa. 6:3), and of glorified spirits (Rev. 4:11): “Thou art
worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor, and power;” and (Rev. 5:13, 14), they worship him ascribing
“Blessing, honor, glory, and power to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.”
Other acts of worship are confined to this life, and leave us as soon as we have set our foot in heaven;
there, no notes but this of praise are warbled out; the power, wisdom, love, and grace in the dispensation
of the gospel, seat themselves in the thoughts and tongues of blessed souls. Can a worship on earth be
spiritual, that hath no mixture of an eternal heavenly duty with it? The worship of God in innocence had
been chiefly an admiration of him in the works of creation; and should not our evangelical worship be an
admiration of him in the works of redemption, which is a restoration to a better state? After the petitioning
for pardoning grace (Hos. 14:2), there is a rendering the calves or heifers of our lips, alluding to the
heifers used in eucharistical sacrifices. The praise of God is the choicest sacrifice and worship under a
dispensation of redeeming grace; this is the prime and eternal part of worship under the gospel. The
Psalmist (Psalm 149:; 150.), speaking of the gospel times, spurs on to this kind of worship; “Sing to the
Lord a new song; let the children of Zion be joyful in their king; let the saints be joyful in glory, and sing
aloud upon their beds; let the high praises of God be in their mouths;” he begins and ends both psalms
with “Praise ye the Lord.” That cannot be a spiritual and evangelical worship, that hath nothing of the
praise of God in the heart. The consideration of God’s adorable perfections, discovered in the gospel, will
make us come to him with more seriousness; beg blessings of him with more confidence; fly to him with
a winged faith and love, and more spiritually glorify him in our attendances upon him.
</p>
<p>
    6. Spiritual worship is performed with delight. The evangelical worship is rophetically signified by
keeping the feast of tabernacles; “They shad go up from year to year, to worship the King, the Lord of
Hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles” (Zech. 14:16): why that feast, when there were other feasts
observed by the Jews? That was a feast celebrated with the greatest joy, typical of the gladness which was
to be under the exhibition of the Messiah, and a thankful commemoration of the redemption wrought by
him. It was to be celebrated five days after the “solemn day of atonement” (Lev. 23:34, compared with
ver. 27), wherein there was one of the solemnest types of the sacrifice of the death of Christ. In this feast
they commemorated their exchange of Egypt for Canaan; the manna wherewith they were fed; the water
out of the rock wherewith they were refreshed; in remembrance of this, they poured water on the ground,
pronouncing those words in Isaiah, they shall “draw waters out of the wells of salvation;” which our
Saviour refers to himself (John 7:37), inviting them to him, to drink “upon the last day, the great day of
the feast of tabernacles,” wherein the solemn ceremony was observed. Since we are freed by the death of
the Redeemer from the curses of the law, God requires of us a joy in spiritual privileges. A sad frame in
worship gives the lie to all gospel liberty, to the purchase of the Redeemer’s death, the triumphs of his
resurrection: it is a carriage, as if we were under the influences of the legal fire and lightning, and an
entering a protest against the freedom of the gospel. The evangelical worship is a spiritual worship; and
praise, Joy, and delight are prophesied of, as great ingredients in attendance on gospel ordinances (Isaiah
12:3–5). What was occasion of terror in the worship of God under the law, is the occasion of delight in
the worship of God under the gospel. The justice and holiness of God, so terrible in the law, becomes
comfortable under the gospel; since they have feasted themselves on the active and passive obedience of
the Redeemer. The approach is to God as gracious, not to God as unpacified; as a son to a father, not as a
criminal to a judge. Under the law, God was represented as a judge; remembering their sin in their
sacrifices, and representing the punishment they had merited: in the gospel as a father, accepting the
atonement, and publishing the reconciliation wrought by the Redeemer. Delight in God is a gospel frame;
therefore the more joyful, the more spiritual: “The sabhath is to be a delight;” not only in regard of the
day, but in regard to the duties of it (Isa. 58:13); in regard of the marvellous work he wrought on it;
raising up our blessed Redeemer on that day, whereby a foundation was laid for the rendering our persons
and services acceptable to God (Psalm 118:24; “This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will be
glad and rejoice in it.” A lumpish frame becomes not a day and a duty, that hath so noble and spiritual a
mark upon it. The angels, in the first act of worship after the creation, were highly joyful (Job 38:7):
“They shouted for joy,” &amp;c. The saints have particularly acted this in their worship. David would not
content himself with an approach to the altar, without going to God as his “exceeding joy” (Psalm 43:4).
My triumphant joy when he danced before the ark, he seems to be transformed into delight and pleasure
(2 Sam. 6:14, 16). He had as much delight in worship, as others had in their harvest and vintage. And
those that took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, would as joyfully attend upon the communications of
God. Where there is a fulness of the Spirit, there is a “waking melody to God in the heart” (Eph. 5:18,
19); and where there is an acting of love (as there is in all spiritual services), the proper fruit of it is joy in
a near approach to the object of the soul’s affection. Love is appetites unionzs; the more love, the more
delight in the approachings of God to the soul, or the outgoings of the soul to God. As the object of
worship is amiable in a spiritual eye, so the means tending to a communion with this object are delightful
in the exercise. Where there is no delight in a duty, there is no delight in the object of the duty; the more
of grace, the more of pleasure in the actings of it; as the more of nature there is in any natural agent, the
more of pleasure in the act, so the more heavenly the worship, the more spiritual. Delight is the frame and
temper of glory. A heart filled up to the brim with joy, is a heart filled up to the brim with the Spirit; joy is
the fruit of the Holy Ghost (Gal. 5:22). (1.) Not the joy of God’s dispensation flowing from God, but a
gracious active joy streaming to God. Theie is a joy, when the comforts of God are dropped into the soul,
as oil upon the wheel; which indeed makes the faculties move with more speed and activity in his service,
like the chariots of Aminadab; and a soul may serve God in the strength of this taste, and its delight
terminate in the sensible comfort. This is not the joy I mean, but such a joy that hath God for its object,
delighting in him as the term, in worship as the way to him; the first is God’s dispensation, the other is our
duty; the first is an act of God’s favor to us, the second a sprout of habitual grace in us. The comforts we
have from God may elevate our duties; but the grace we have within doth spiritualize our duties. (2.) Nor
is every delight an argument of a spiritual service. All the requisites to worship must be taken in. A man
may invent a worship and delight in it; as Micah in the adoration of his idol, when he was glad he had got
both an Ephod and a Levite (Judges 17). As a man may have a contentment in sin, so he may have a
contentment in worship; not because it is a worship of God, but the worship of his own invention,
agreeable to his own humor and design, as (Isa. 58:2) it is said, they “delighted in approaching to God;”
but it was for carnal ends. Novelty engenders complacency; but it must be a worship wherein God will
delight; and that must be a worship according to his own rule and infinite wisdom, and not our shallow
fancies. God requires a cheerfulness in his service, especially under the gospel, where he sits upon a
throne of grace; discovers himself in his amiableness, and acts the covenant of grace, and the sweet
relation of a father. The priests of old were not to sully themselves with any sorrow, when they were in
the exercise of their functions. God put a bar to the natural affections of Aaron and his sons, when Nadab
and Abihu had been cut off by a severe hand of God (Lev. 10:6). Every true Christian in a higher order of
priesthood, is a person dedicated to joy and peace, offering himself a lively sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving; and there is no christian duty, but is to be set off and seasoned with cheerfulness: he that
loves a cheerful giver in acts of charity, requires no less a cheerful spirit in acts of worship; as this is an
ingredient in worship, so it is the means to make your spirits intent in worship. When the heart triumphs
in the consideration of divine excellency and goodness, it will be angry at anything that offers to jog and
disturb it.

<p>
    7. Spiritual worship is to be performed, though with a delight in God, yet with a deep reverence of
God. The gospel, in advancing the spirituality of worship, takes off the terror, but not the reverence of
God; which is nothing else in its own nature, but a due and high esteem of the excellency of a thing
according to the nature of it; and, therefore, the gospel presenting us with more illustrious notices of the
glorious nature of God, is so far from indulging any disesteem of him, that it requires of us a greater
reverence suitable to the height of its discovery, above what could be spelt in the book of creation; the
gospel worship is therefore expressed by trembling (Hos.11:10): “They shall walk after the Lord; he shall
roar like a lion; when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the West.” When the lion of the
tribe of Judah shall lift up his powerful voice in the gospel, the western Gentiles shall run trembling to
walk after the Lord. God hath alway attended his greatest manifestations with remarkable characters of
majesty, to create a reverence in his creature he caused the “wind to march before him,” to cut the
mountain, when he manifested himself to Elijah (1 Kings 19:11); “A wind and a cloud of fire,” before that
magnificent vision to Ezekiel (chap. 1:4, 5); “Thunders and lightnings” before the giving the law (Exod.
19:18); and a “mighty wind” before the giving the Spirit (Acts 2.): God requires of us an awe of him in
the very act of performance. The angels are pure, and cannot fear him as sinners, but in “reverence they
cover their faces” when they stand before him (Isa. 6:2): his power should make us reverence him, as we
are creatures; his justice, as we are sinners; his goodness, as we are restored creatures. “God is clothed
with unspeakable majesty; the glory of his face shines brighter than the lights of heaven in their beauty.
Before him the angels tremble, and the heavens melt; we ought not therefore to come before him with the
sacrifice of fools, nor tender a duty to him, without falling low upon our faces, and bowing the knees of
our hearts in token of reverence.”516 Not a slavish fear, like that of devils; but a “godly fear,” like that of
saints (Heb. 12:28); joined with a sense of an unmovable kingdom, becometh us; and this the apostle calls
a grace necessary to make our service acceptable, and therefore the grace necessary to make it spiritual,
since nothing finds admission to God, but what is of a spiritual nature. The consideration of his glorious
nature should imprint an awful respect upon our souls to him; his goodness should make his majesty more
adorable to us, as his majesty makes his goodness more, admirable in his condescensions to us. As God is
a Spirit, our worship must be spiritual; and being, as he is, the supreme Spirit, our worship must be
reverential; we must observe the state he takes upon him in his ordinances; “He is in heaven, we upon the
earth;” we must not therefore be “hasty to utter anything before God” (Eccles. 5:7). Consider him a Spirit
in the highest heavens, and ourselves spirits dwelling in a dreggy earth. Loose and garish frames debase
him to our own quality; slight postures of spirit intimate him to be a slight and mean being; our being in
covenant with him, must not lower our awful apprehensions of him; as lie is the Lord thy God, it is a
glorious and fearful name, or wonderful (Deut. 28:58); though he lay by his justice to believers, he doth
not lay by his majesty; when we have a confidence in him, because he is the Lord our God, we must have
awful thoughts of his majesty, because his name is glorious. God is terrible from his holy places, in regard
of the great things he doth for his Israel (Psalm 68:35); we should behave ourselves with that inward
honor and respect of him, as if he were present to our bodily eyes; the higher apprehensions we have of
his majesty, the greater awe will be upon our hearts in his presence, and the greater spirituality in our acts.
We should manage our hearts so, as if we had a view of God in his heavenly glory.
</p>
<p>
    8. Spiritual worship is to be performed with humility in our spirits. This is to follow upon the
reverence of God. As we are to have high thoughts of God, that we may not debase him; we must have
low thoughts of ourselves, not to vaunt before him. When we have right notions of the Divine Majesty,
we shall be as worms in our own thoughts, and creep as worms into his presence; we can never consider
him in his glory, but we have a fit opportunity to reflect upon ourselves, and consider how basely we
revolted from him, and how graciously we are restored by him. As the gospel affords us greater
discoveries of God’s nature, and so enhanceth our reverence of him, so it helps us to a fuller
understanding of our own vileness and weakness, and therefore is proper to engender humility; the more
spiritual and evangelical therefore any service is, the more humble it is. That is a spiritual service that
doth most manifest the glory of God; and this cannot be manifested by us, without manifesting our own
emptiness and nothingness. The heathens were sensible of the necessity of humility by the light of
nature;517 after the name of God, signified by Ἐῖ inscribed on the temple at Delphos, followed Γνῶθί
σεαυιον, whereby was insinuated, that when we have to do with God, who is the only Ens, we should
behave ourselves with a sense of our own infirmity, and infinite distance from him. As a person, so a duty
leavened with pride, hath nothing of sincerity, and therefore nothing of spirituality in it (Hab. 2:4): “His
soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him.” The elders that were crowned by God to be kings and
priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices, uncrown themselves in their worship of him, and cast down their
ornaments at “his feet”518 the Greek word to worship, προσκυνείν, signifies to creep like a dog upon his
belly before his master; to lie low. How deep should our sense be of the privilege of God’s admitting us to
his worship, and affording us such a mercy under our deserts of wrath! How mean should be our thoughts,
both of our persons and performances! How patiently should we wait upon God for the success of
worship! How did Abraham, the father of the faithful, equal himself to the earth, when he supplicated the
God of heaven, and devote himself to him under the title of very “dust and ashes!” (Gen. 18:27.) Isaiah
did but behold an evangelical apparition of God and the angels worshipping him, and presently reflects
upon his “own uncleanness” (Isa. 6:5). God’s presence both requires and causes humility. How lowly is
David in his own opinion, after a magnificent duty performed by himself and his people (1 Chron. 29:14):
“Who am I? and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly?” The more spiritual the
soul is in its carriage to God, the more humble it is; and the more gracious God is in his communications
to the soul, the lower it lies. God commanded not the fiercer creatures to be offered to him in sacrifices,
but lambs and kids, meek and lowly creatures; none that had stings in their tails, or venom in their
tongues.519 The meek lamb was the daily sacrifice; the doves were to be offered by pairs; God would not
have honey mixed with any sacrifice (Lev. 2:11), that breeds choler, and choler pride; but oil he
commanded to be used, that supples and mollifies the parts. Swelling pride and boiling passions render
our services carnal; they cannot be spiritual, without a humble sweetness and an innocent sincerity; one
grain of this transcends the most costly sacrifices: a contrite heart puts a gloss upon worship (Psalm
51:16, 17). The departure of men and angels from God, began in pride; our approaches and return to him
must begin in humility; and therefore all those graces, which are bottomed on humility, must be acted in
worship, as faith, and a sense of our own indigence. Our blessed Saviour, the most spiritual worshiper,
prostrated himself in the garden with the greatest lowliness, an offered himself upon the cross a sacrifice
with the greatest humility. Melted souls in worship have the most spiritual conformity to the person of
Christ in the state of humiliation, and his design in that state; as worship without it is not suitable to God,
so neither is it advantageous for us. A time of worship is a time of God’s communication. The vessel must
be melted to receive the mould it is designed for; softened wax is fittest to receive a stamp, and a
spiritually melted soul fittest to receive a spiritual impression. We cannot perform duty in an evangelical
and spiritual strain, without the meltingness and meanness in ourselves which the gospel requires.
</p>
<p>
    9. Spiritual worship is to be performed with holiness. God is a holy Spirit; a likeness to God must
attend the worshipping of God as he is; holiness is alway in season; “It becomes his house forever”
(Psalm 91:5). We can never serve the living God till we “have consciences purged from dead works”
(Heb. 11:14). Dead works in our consciences are unsuitable to God, an eternal living Spirit. The more
mortified the heart, the more quickened the service. Notbing can please an infinite purity but that which is
pure; since God is in his glory, in his ordinances, we must not be in our filthiness. The holiness of his
Spirit doth sparkle in his ordinances; the holiness of our spirits ought also to sparkle in our observance of
them. The holiness of God is most celebrated in the worship of angels;520 spiritual worship ought to be
like angelical; that cannot be with souls totally impure. As there must be perfect holiness to make a
worship perfectly spiritual; so there must be some degree of holiness to make it in any measure spiritual.
God would have all the utensils of the sanctuary employed about his service to be holy; the inwards of the
sacrifice were to be rinsed thrice.521 The crop and feathers of sacrificed doves were to be hung eastward
towards the entrance of the temple, at a distance from the holy of holies, where the presence of God was
most eminent (Lev. 1:16). When Aaron was to go into the holy of holies, he was to “sanctify himself” in
an extraordinary manner (Lev. 16:4). The priests were to be bare-footed in the temple, in the exercise of
their office; shoes alway were to be put off upon holy ground: “Look to thy foot when thou goest to the
house of God,” saith the wise man (Eccles. 5:1). Strip the affections, the feet of the soul, of all the dirt
contracted; discard all earthly and base thoughts from the heart. A beast was not to touch the Mount Sinai,
without losing his life; nor can we come near the throne with brutish affections, without losing the life and
fruit of the worship. An unholy soul degrades himself from a spirit to a brute, and the worship from
spiritual to brutish. If any unmortified sin be found in the life, as it was in the comers to the temple, it
taints and pollutes the worship (Isa. 1:15). All worship is an acknowledgment of the excellency of God as
he is holy; hence it is called, a “sanctifying God’s name” (Jer. 7:9, 10); how can any person sanctify
God’s name that hath not a holy resemblance to his nature? If he be not holy as he is holy, he cannot
worship him according to his excellency in spirit and in truth; no worship is spiritual wherein we have not
a communion with God. But what intercourse can there be between a holy God, and an impure creature;
between light and darkness? We have no fellowship with him in any service, unless “we walk in the
light,” in service and out of service, as he is light (1 John 1:7). The heathen thought not their sacrifices
agreeable to God without washing their hands; whereby they signified the preparation of their hearts,
before they made the oblation: clean hands without a pure heart, signify nothing; the frame of our hearts
must answer the purity of the outward symbols (Psalm 26:6): “I will wash my ands in innocence, so will I
compass thine altar, O Lord;” he would observe the appointed ceremonies, but not without “cleansing his
heart as well as his hands.” Vain man is apt to rest upon outward acts and rites of worship; but this must
alway be practised; the words are in the present tense, “I wash,” “I compass.” Purity in worship ought to
be our continual care. If we would perform a spiritual service, wherein we would have communion with
God, it must be in holiness; if we would walk with Christ, it must be in “white” (Rev. 3:4), alluding to the
white garments the priests put on, when they went to perform their service; as without this we cannot see
God in heaven, so neither can we see the beauty of God in his own ordinances.
</p>
<p>
     10. Spiritual worship is performed with spiritual ends, with raised aims at the glory of God. No duty
can be spiritual that hath a carnal aim; where God is the sole object, he ought to be the principal end; in all
our actions he is to be our end, as he is the principle of our being; much more in religious acts, as he is the
object of our worship. The worship of God in Scripture is expressed by the “seeking of him” (Heb. 11:6);
him, not ourselves; all is to be referred to God. As we are “not to live to ourselves, that being the sign of a
carnal state, so we are not to worship for ourselves” (Rom. 14:7, 8). As all actions are denominated good
from their end, as well as their object, so upon the same account they are denominated spiritual. The end
spiritualizeth our natural actions, much more our religious; then are our faculties devoted to him when
they centre in him. If the intention be evil, there is nothing but darkness in the whole service (Luke
11:34). The first institution of the Sabhath, the solemn day for worship, was to contemplate the glory of
God in his stupendous works of creation, and render him a homage for them (Rev. 4:11): “Thou art
worthy, O Lord, to receive honor, glory, and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
they are and were created.” No worship can be returned without a glorifying of God; and we cannot
actually glorify him, without direct aims at the promoting his honor. As we have immediately to do with
God, so we are immediately to mind the praise of God. As we are not to content ourselves with habitual
grace, but be rich in the exercise of it in worship, so we are not to acquiesce in the habitual aims at the
glory of God, without the actual overflowings of our hearts in those aims. It is natural for man to worship
God for self; self-righteousness is the rooted aim of man in his worship since his revolt from God, and
being sensible it is not to be found in his natural actions, he seeks for it in his moral and religious. By the
first pride we flung God off from being our sovereign, and from being our end, since a pharisaical spirit
struts it in nature, not only to do things to be seen of men, but to be admired by God (Isa. 58:3).
“Wherefore have we fasted and thou takest no knowledge?” This is to have God worship them, instead of
being worshipped by them. Cain’s carriage after his sacrifice testified some base end in his worship; he
came not to God as a subject to a sovereign, but as if he had been the sovereign, and God the subject; and
when his design is not answered, and his desire not gratified, he proves more a rebel to God, and a
murderer of his brother. Such base scents will rise up in our worship from the body of death which
cleaves to us, and mix themselves with our services, as weeds with the fish in the net. David, therefore,
after his people had offered willingl to the temple, begs of God that their “hearts might be prepare to him”
(1 Chron. 29:18); that their hearts might stand right to God, without any squinting to self-ends. Some
present themselves to God, as poor men offer a present to a great person not to honor him, but to gain for
themselves a reward richer than their gift. “What profit is it that we have kept his ordinance?” &amp;c. (Mal.
3:14). Some worship him, intending thereby to make him amends for the wrong they have done him; wipe
off their scores, and satisfy their debts; as though a spiritual wrong could be recompensed with a bodily
service, and an infinite Spirit be outwitted and appeased by a carnal flatter. Self is the spirit of carnality;
to pretend a homage to God, and intend only the advantage of self, is rather to mock him than worship
him. When we believe that we ought to be satisfied, rather than God glorified, we set God below
ourselves, imagine that he should submit his own honor to our advantage; we make ourselves more
glorious than God, as though we were not made for him, but he hath a being only for us; this is to have a
very low esteem of the majesty of God. Whatsoever any man aims at in worship above the glory of God,
that he forms as an idol to himself instead of God, and sets up a golden image, God counts not this as a
worship. The offerings made in the wilderness for forty years together, God esteemed as not offered to
him (Amos 5:25): “Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house
of Israel?” They did it not to God, but to themselves; for their own security, and the attainment of the
possession of the promised land. A spiritual worshipper performs not worship for some hopes of carnal
advantage; he uses ordinances as means to bring God and his soul together, to be more fitted to honor
God in the world, in his particular place; when he hath been inflamed and humble in any address or duty,
he gives God the glory; his heart suits the doxology at the end of the Lord’s Prayer, ascribes the kingdom,
power, and glory to God alone, and if any viper of pride starts out upon him, he endeavors presently to
shake it off. That which was the first end of our framing, ought to be the chief end of our acting towards
God; but when men have the same ends in worship as brutes, the satisfaction of a sensitive part, the
service is no more than brutish. The acting for a sensitive end is unworthy the majesty of God to whom
we address, and unbecoming a rational creature. The acting for a sensitive end is not a rational, much less
can it be a spiritual service; though the act may be good in itself, yet not good in the agent, because he
wants a due end. We are, then, spiritual, when we have the same end in our redeemed services, as God
had in his redeeming love, viz., his own glory.
</p>
<p>
    11. Spiritual service is offered to God in the name of Christ. Those are only “spiritual sacrifices, that
are offered up to God by Jesus Christ” (1 Pet. 2:5); that are the fruits of the sanctification of the Spirit, and
offered in the mediation of the Son: as the altar sanctifies the gift, so doth Christ s iritualize our services
for God’s acceptation; as the fire upon the altar separated the airy and finer parts of the sacrifice from the
terrene and earthly; this is the golden altar upon which the prayers of the saints are offered up “before the
throne” (Rev. 8:3). As all that we have from God streams through his blood, so all that we give to God
ascends by virtue of his merits. All the blessings God gave to the Israelites came out of Sion,522 that is,
from the gospel hid under the law; all the duties we present to God are to presented in Sion, in an
evangelical manner; all our worship must be bottomed on Christ. God hath intended that we should
“honor the Son, as we honor the Father;” as we honor the Father by offering our service only to him, so
we are to honor the Son by offering it only in his name; in him alone God is well pleased, because in him
alone he finds our services spiritual and worthy of acceptation; we must therefore take fast hold of him
with our spirits, and the faster we hold him, the more spirit. ual is our worship. To do anything in the
name of Christ, is not to believe the worship shall be accepted for itself, but to have our eye fixed upon
Christ for the acceptance of it, and not to rest upon le work done, as carnal people are apt to do. The
creatures present their acknowledgments to God by man; and man can only present his by Christ. It was
utterly unlawful after the building of the temple, to sacrifice anywhere else; the temple being a type of
Christ, it is utterly unlawful for us to present our services in any other name than his. This is the way to be
spiritual. If we consider God out of Christ, we can have no other notions but those of horror and bondage.
We behold him a Spirit, but environed with justice and wrath for sinners; but the consideration of him in
Christ, veils his justice, draws forth his mercy, represents him more a father than a judge. In Christ the
aspect of justice is changed, and by that the temper of the creature; so that in and by this Mediator, we
“can have a spiritual boldness, and access to God with confidence” (Eph. 3:12), whereby the spirit is kept
from benumbness and distraction, and our souls quickened and refined. The thoughts kept upon Christ in
a duty of worship quickly elevates the soul, and spiritualizeth the whole service. Sin makes our services
black, and the blood of Christ makes both our persons and services white.
</p>
<p>
    To conclude this head. God is a Spirit infinitely happy, therefore we must approach to him with
cheerfulness; he is a Spirit of infinite majesty, therefore we must come before him with reverence; he is a
Spirit infinitely high, therefore we must offer up our sacrifices with the deepest humility; he is a Spirit
infinitel holy, therefore we must address him with purity; he is a Spirit infinitely glorious, we must
therefore acknowledge his excellency in all that we do, and in our measures contribute to his glory, by
having the highest aims in his worship; he is a Spirit infinitely provoked by us, therefore we must offer up
our worship in the name of a pacifying Mediator and Intercessor.
</p>
<p>
    III. The third general is, Why a spiritual worship is due to God, and to be offered to him. We must
consider the object of worship, and the subject of worship; the worshipper and the worshipped. God is a
spiritual Being; man is a reasonable creature. The nature of God informs us what is fit to be presented to
him; our own nature informs us what is fit to be presented by us.
</p>
<p>
    Reason I. The best we have is to be presented to God in worship. For,
</p>
<p>
    1. Since God is the most excellent Being, he is to be served by us with the most excellent thing we
have, and with the choicest veneration. God is so incomprehensibly excellent, that we cannot render him
what he deserves: we must render him what we are able to offer: the best of our affections; the flower of
our strength; the cream and top of our spirits. By the same reason that we are bound to give God the best
worship, we must offer it to him in the best manner. We cannot give to God anything too good for so
blessed a Being; God being a “great king,” slight services become not his majesty (Mal. 1:13, 14); it is
unbecoming the majesty of God, and the reason of a creature, to give him a trivial thing; it is unworthy to
bestow the best of our strength on our lust, and the worst and weakest in the service of God. An infinite
Spirit should have affections as near to infinite as we can; as he is a Spirit without bounds, so he should
have a service without limits; when we have given him all, we cannot serve him according to the
excellency of his nature (Josh. 24:19); and shall we give him less than all? His infinite excellency, and our
dependence on him as creatures, demands the choicest adoration; our spirits, being the noblest part of our
nature, are as due to him as the service of our bodies, which are the vilest; to serve him with the worst
only, is to diminish his honor.
</p>
<p>
    2. Under the law, God commanded the best to be offered him. He would have the males, the best of
the kind; the fat, the best of the creature;523 he commanded them to offer him the firstlings of the flock;
not the firstlings of the womb, but the firstlings of the year the Jewish cattle having two breeding-times, in
the beginning of the spring and the beginning of September; the latter breed was the weaker, which Jacob
knew (Gen. 30.) when he laid the rods before the cattle when they were strong in the spring, and withheld
them when they were feeble in the autumn. One reason (as the Jews say) why God accepted not the
offering of Cain was, because he brought the meanest, not the best of the fruit; and therefore, it is said,
only that he brought of the “fruit” of the ground (Gen. 4:3), not the first of the fruit, or the best of the fruit,
as Abel, who brought the “firstling” of his flock, and the fat thereof (ver. 4).
</p>
<p>
    3. And this the heathen practised by the, light of nature. They for the most part offered males, as being
more worthy; and burnt the male, not the female frankincense, as it is divided into those two kinds; they
offered the best, when they offered their children to Moloch. Nothing more excellent than man, and
nothing dearer to parents than their children, which are part of themselves. When the Israelites would
have a golden calf for a representation of God, they would dedicate their jewels, and strip their wives and
children of their richest ornaments, to show their devotion. Shall men serve their dumb idols with the best
of their substance, and the strength of their souls; and shall the living God have a duller service from us,
than idols had from them? God requires no such hard, but delightful worship from us, our spirits.
</p>
<p>
    4. All creatures serve man, by the providential order of God, with the best they have. As we, by God’s
appointment, receive from creatures the best they can give, ought we not with a free will to render to God
the best we can offer? The beasts give us their best fat; the trees their best fruit; the sun its best light; the
foun. tins their best streams; shall God order us the best from creatures, and we put him off with the worst
from ourselves?
</p>
<p>
    5. God hath given us the choicest thing he had—a Redeemer that was the power of God, and the
wisdom of God; the best he had in heaven, his own Son, and in himself a sacrifice for us, that we might be
enabled to resent ourselves a sacrifice to him. And Christ offered himself for us, the best he had, and that
with the strength of the Deity through the eternal Spirit; and shall we grudge God the best part of
ourselves? As God would have a worship from his creature, so it must be with the best part of his
creature. If we have “given ourselves to the Lord” (2 Cor. 8:5), we can worship with no less than
ourselves. What is the man without his spirit? If we are to worship God with all that we have received
from him, we must worship him with the best part we have received from him; it is but a small glory we
can give him with the best, and shall we deprive him of his right by giving him the worst? As what we are
is from God, so what we are ought to be for God. Creation is the foundation of worship (Psalm 100:2, 3):
“Serve the Lord with gladness; know ye that the Lord he is God; it is he that hath made us.” He hath
ennobled us with spiritual affections; where is it fittest for us to employ them, but upon him? and at what
time, but when we come solemnly to converse with him? Is it justice to deny him the honor of his best gift
to us? our souls are more his gift to us, than anything in the world; other things are so given that they are
often taken from us, but our spirits are the most durable gift. Rational faculties cannot be removed without
a dissolution of nature. Well then, as he is God, he is to be honored with all the propensions and ardor that
the infiniteness and excellency of such a Being require, and the incomparable obligations he hath laid
upon us in this state deserve at our hands. In all our worship, therefore, our minds ought to be filled with
the highest admiration, love, and reverence. Since our end was to glorify God, we answer not our end, and
honor him not, unless we give him the choicest we have.524
</p>
<p>
     Reason II. We cannot else act towards God according to the nature of rational creatures. Spiritual
worship is due to God, because of his nature; and due from us, because of our nature. As we are to adore
God, so we are to adore him as men; the nature of a rational creature makes this impression upon him; he
cannot view his own nature without having this duty striking upon his mind. As he knows, by inspection
into himself, that there was a God that made him; so, that he is made to be in subjection to God,
subjection to him in his spirit as well as his body, and ought morally to testify this natural dependence on
him. His constitution informs him that he hath a capacity to converse with God; that he cannot converse
with him, but by those inward faculties; if it could be managed by his body without his spirit, beasts might
as well converse with God as men. It can never be a “reasonable service” (Rom. 12:1), as it ought to be,
unless the reasonable faculties be employed in the management of it; it must be a worship prodigiously
lame, without the concurrence of the chiefest art of man with it. As we are to act conformably to the
nature of the object, so also to the nature of our own faculties. Our faculties, in the very gift of them to us,
were destined to be exercised, about what? What? All other things but the Author of them. It is a conceit
cannot enter into the heart of a rational creature, that he should act as such a creature in other things, and
as a stone in things relating to the donor of them; as a man, with his mind about him in the affairs of the
world; as a beast, without reason in his acts towards God. If a man did not employ his reason in other
things, he would be an unprofitable creature in the world: if he do not employ his spiritual faculties in
worship, he denies them the proper end and use for which they were given him; it is a practical denial that
God hath given him a soul, and that God hath any right to the exercise of it. If there were no worship
appointed by God in the world, the natural inclination of man to some kind of religion would be in vain;
and if our inward faculties were not employed in the duties of religion they would be in vain; the true end
of God in the endowment of us with them would be defeated by us, as much as lies in us, if we did not
serve him with that which we have from him solely at his own cost. As no man can with reason conclude,
that the rest commanded on the Sabhath and the sanctification of it, was only a rest of the body, that had
been performed by the beasts as well as men, but some higher end was aimed at for the rational creature;
so no man can think that the command for worship terminated only in the presence of the body; that God
should give the command to man as a reasonable creature, and expect no other service from him than that
of a brute. God did not require a worship from man for any want he had, or any essential honor that could
accrue to him, but that men might testify their gratitude to him, and dependence on him. It is the most
horrid ingratitude not to have lively and deep sentiments of gratitude after such obligations, and not to
make those due acknowledgments that are proper for a rational creature. Religion is the highest and
choicest act of a reasonable creature; no creature under heaven is capable of it that wants reason. As it is a
violation of reason not to worship God, so it is no less a violation of reason not to worship him with the
heart and spirit; it is a high dishonor to God, and defeats him not only of the service due to him from man,
but that which is due to him from all the creatures. Every creature, as it is an effect of God’s power and
wisdom, doth passively worship God; that is, it doth afford matter of adoration to man that hath reason to
collect it, and return it where it is due. Without the exercise of the soul, we can no more hand it to God,
than without such an exercise, we can gather it from the creature; so that by this neglect, the creatures are
restrained from answering their chief end; they cannot pay any service to God without man; nor can man,
without the employment of his rational faculties, render a homage to God, any more than boasts can. This
engagement of our inward power stands firm and inviolable, let the modes of worship be what they will,
or the changes of them by the sovereign authority of God never so frequent; this could not expire or be
changed as long as the nature of man endured. As man had not been capable of a command for worship,
unless he had been endued with spiritual faculties; so he is not active in a true practice of worship, unless
they be employed by him in it. The constitution of man makes this manner of worship perpetually
obligatory, and the oblation can never cease, till man cease to be a creature furnished with such faculties;
in our worship, therefore, if we would act like rational creatures, we should extend all the powers of our
souls to the utmost pitch, and essay to have apprehensions of God, equal to the excellency of his nature,
which, though we may attempt, we can never attain.
</p>
<p>
     Reason III. Without this engagement of our spirits no act is an act of worship. True worship, being an
acknowledgment of God and the perfections of his nature, results only from the soul, that being only
capable of knowing God and those perfections which are the object and motive of worship. The posture of
the body is but to testify the inward temper and affection of the mind; if, therefore, it testifies what it is
not, it is a lie, and no worship; the cringes a beast may be taught to make to an altar may as well be called
worship, since a man thinks as little of that God he pretends to honor, as the beast doth of the altar to
which he bows. Worship is a reverent remembrance of God, and giving some honor to him with the
intention of the soul; it cannot justly have the name of worship, that wants the essential part of it; it is an
ascribing to God the glory of his nature, an owning subjection and obedience to him as our sovereign
Lord; this is as impossible to be performed without the spirit, as that there can be life and motion in a
body without a soul; it is a drawing near to God, not in regard of his essential presence, so all things are
near to God, but in an acknowledgment of his excellency, which is an act of the spirit; without this, the
worst of men in a place of worship are as near to God as the best. The necessity of the conjunction of our
soul ariseth from the nature of worship, which being the most serious thing we can be employed in, the
highest converse with the highest object requires the choicest temper of spirit in the performance. That
cannot be an act of worship, which is not an act of piety and virtue; but there is no act of virtue done by
the members of the body, without the concurrence of the powers of the soul. We may as well call the
presence of a dead carcass in a place of worship, an act of religion, as the presence of a living body
without an intent spirit; the separation of the soul from one is natural, the other moral; that renders the
body lifeless, but this renders the act loathsome to God; as the being of the soul gives life to the body, so
the operation of the soul gives life to the actions. As he cannot be a man that wants the form of a man, a
rational soul; so that cannot be a worship that wants an essential part, the act of the spirit; God will not
vouchsafe any acts of man so noble a title without the requisite qualifications (Hos. 5:6): “The shall go
with their flocks and their herds to seek the Lord,” &amp;c. A multitude of lambs and bullocks for sacrifice, to
appease God’s anger. God would not give it the title of worship, though instituted by himself, when it
wanted the qualities of such a service. “The spirit of whoredom was in the midst of them” (v. 4). In the
judgment of our Saviour, it is a “vain worship, when the traditions of men are taught for the doctrines of
God” (Matt. 15:9); and no less vain must it be, when the bodies of men are presented to supply the place
of their spirits. As an omission of duty is a contempt of God’s sovereign authority, so the omission of the
manner of it is a contempt of it, and of his amiable excellency; and that which is a contempt and mockery,
can lay no just claim to the title of worship.
</p>
<p>
     Reason IV. There is in worship an approach of God to man. It was instituted to this purpose, that God
might give out his blessings to man; and ought not our spirits to be prepared and ready to receive his
communications? We are, in such acts, more peculiarly, in his presence. In the Israelites hearing the law,
it is said, God was to “come among them” (Exod. 19:10, 11). Then, men are said to stand before the Lord
(Deut. 10:8): “God, before whom I stand” (1 Kings 17:1): that is, whom I worship; and therefore when
Cain forsook the worship of God settled in his father’s family, he is said, “to go out from the presence of
the Lord” (Gen. 4:6). God is essentially present in the world; graciously present in his church. The name
of the evangelical city is Jehovah Shammah (Ezek. 48:35), “the Lord is there.” God is more graciously
present in the evangelical institutions than in the legal; he “loves the gates of Zion more than all the
dwellings of Jacob” (Psalm 87:2); his evangelical law and worship which was to go forth from Zion, as
the other did from Sinai (Mic. 4:2). God delights to approach to men, and converse with them in the
worship instituted in the gospel, more than in all the dwellings of Jacob. If God be graciously present,
ought not we to be spiritually present? A lifeless carcass service becomes not so high and delectable a
presence as this; it is to thrust him from us, not invite him to us; it is to Practise in the ordinances what the
prophet predicts concerning men s usage of our Saviour (Isa. 53:2): “There is no form, no comeliness, nor
beauty that we should desire him.” A slightness in worship reflects upon the excellency of the object of
worship. God and his worship are so linked together, that whosoever thinks the one not worth his inward
care, esteems the other not worth his inward affection. How unworthy a slight is it of God, who proffers
the opening his treasure; the re-impressing his image; conferring his blessings; admits us into his
presence, when he hath no need for us; who hath millions of angels to attend him in his court, and
celebrate his praise! He that worships not God with his spirit, regards not God’s presence in his
ordinances, and slights the great end of God in them, and that perfection he may attain by them. We can
only expect what God hath promised to give, when we tender to him what he hath commanded us to
present. If we put off God with a shell, he will put us off with a husk. How can we expect his heart, when
we do not give him ours; or hope for the blessing needful for us, when we render not the glory due to
him? It cannot be an advantageous worship without spiritual graces; for those are uniting, and union is the
ground of all communion.
</p>
<p>
    Reason V. To have a spiritual worship is God’s end in the restoration of the creature, both in
redemption by his Son and sanctification by his spirit. A fitness for spiritual offerings was the end of the
“coming of Christ” (Mal. 3:3); he should purge them as gold and silver by fire, a spirit burning up their
dross, melting them into a holy compliance with and submission to God. To what purpose? That they may
offer to the lord an offering in righteousness; a pure offering from a purified spirit; he came to “bring us to
God” (1 Pet. 3:18) in such a garb, as that we might be fit to converse with him. Can we be thus, without a
fixedness of our spirits on him? The offering of spiritual sacrifices is the end of making any a “spiritual
habitation” and a “holy priesthood” (1 Pet. 2:5). We can no more be worshippers of God without a
worshipper’s nature, than a man can be a man without human nature. As man was at first created for the
honor and worship of God, so the design of restoring that image which was defaced by sin tends to the
same end. We are not brought to God by Christ, nor are our services presented to hire, if they be without
our spirits; would any man that undertakes to bring another to a prince, introduce him in a slovenly and
sordid habit, such a garb that he knows hateful to him? or bring the clothes or skin of a man stuffed with
straw, instead of the person? to come with our skins before God, without our spirits, is contrary to the
design of God in redemption and regeneration. If a carnal worship would have pleased God, a carnal heart
would have served his turn, without the expense of his Spirit in sanctification. He bestows upon man a
spiritual nature, that he may return to him a spiritual service; he enlightens the understanding, that he may
have a rational service; and new moulds the will, that he may have a voluntary service. As it is the milk of
the word wherewith he feeds us, so it is the service of the word wherewith we must glorify him. So much
as there is of confusedness in our understanding, so much of starting and levity in our wills, so much of
slipperiness and skipping in our affections; so much is abated of the due qualities of the worship of God,
and so much we fall short of the end of redemption and sanctification.
</p>
<p>
    Reason VI. A spiritual worship is to be offered to God, because no worship but that can be acceptable.
We can never be secured of acceptance without it; he being a Spirit, nothing but the worship in apirit can
be suitable to him: what is unsuitable, cannot be acceptable; there must be something in us, to make our
services capable of being presented by Christ for an actual acceptation. No service is “acceptable to God
by Jesus Christ,” but as it is a spiritual sacrifice, and offered by a spiritual heart (1 Pet. 2:5). The sacrifice
is first spiritual, before it be acceptable to God by Christ; when it is “an offering in righteousness,” it is
then, and only then, pleasant to the Lord (Mal. 3:3, 4). No prince would accept a gift that is unsuitable to
his majesty, and below the condition of the person that presents it. Would he be pleased with a bottle of
water for drink, from one that hath his cellar full of wine? How unacceptable must that be that is
unsuitable to the Divine Majesty! And what can be more unsuitable than a withdrawing the operations of
our souls from him, in the oblation of our bodies? We as little glorify God as God, when we give him only
a corporeal worship, as the heathen did, when they represented him in a corporeal shape (Rom. 1:21); one
as well as the other denies his spiritual nature: this is worse, for had it been lawful to represent God to the
eye, it could not have been done but by a bodily figure suited to the sense; but since it is necessary to
worship him, it cannot be by a corporeal attendance, without the operation of the Spirit. A spiritual frame
is more pleasing to God than the highest exterior adornments, than the greatest gifts, and the highest
prophetic illuminations. “The glory of the second temple” exceeded the glory of the first (Hag. 2:8, 9). As
God accounts the spiritual glory of ordinances most beneficial for us, so our spiritual attendance upon
ordinances is most pleasing to him; he that offers the greatest services without it, offers but flesh (Hos.
8:13): “They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, but the Lord accepts them not.” Spiritual
frames are the soul of religious services; all other carriages without them are contemptible to this spirit:
we can never lay claim to that promise of God, none shall “seek my face in vain.” We affect a vain
seeking of him, when we want a due temper of spirit for him; and vain spirits shall have vain returns: it is
more contrary to the nature of God’s holiness to have communion with such, than it is contrary to the
nature of light to have communion with darkness. To make use of this:
</p>
<p>
     Use 1. First it serves for information.
</p>
<p>
     1. If spiritual worship be required by God, how sad is it for them that they are so far from giving God
a spiritual worship, that they render him no worship at all! I speak not of the neglect of public, but of
private; when men present not a devotion to God from one year’s end to the other. The speech of our
Saviour, that we must worship God in spirit and truth, implies that a worship is due to him from every
one; that is the common impression upon the consciences of all men in the world, if they have not by
some constant course in gross sins, hardened their souls, and stifled those natural sentiments. There was
never a nation in the world without some kind of religion; and no religion was ever without some modes
to testify a devotion; the heathens had their sacrifices and purifications; and the Jews, by God’s order, had
their rites, whereby they were to express their allegiance to God. Consider,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) Worship is a duty incumbent upon all men. It is a homage mankind owes to God, under the
relation wherein he stands obliged to him; it is a prime and immutable justice to own our allegiance to
him; it is as unchangeable a truth that God is to be worshipped, as that God is; he is to be worshipped as
God, as creator, and therefore by all, since he is the Creator of all, the Lord of all, and all are his creatures,
and all are his subjects. Worship is founded upon creation (Psalm 100:2, 3): it is due to God for himself
and his own essential excellency, and therefore due from all; it is due upon the account of man’s nature;
the human rational nature is the same in all. Whatsoever is due to God upon the account of man’s nature,
and the natural obligations he hath laid upon man, is due from all men; because they all enjoy the benefits
which are proper to their nature. Man in no state was exempted, nor can be exempted from it; in Paradise
he had his Sabhath and sacraments; man therefore dissolves the obligation of a reasonable nature, by
neglecting the worship of God. Religion is in the first place to be minded. As soon as Noah came out of
the ark, he contrived not a habitation for himself, but an altar for the Lord, to acknowledge him the author
of his preservation from the deluge (Gen. 8:20): and wheresoever Abraham came, his first business was to
erect an altar, and pay his arrears of gratitude to God, before he ran upon the score for new mercies (Gen.
12:7; 13:4, 18): he left a testimony of worship wherever he came.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Wholly therefore to neglect it, is a high degree of atheism. He that calls not upon God, “saith in
his heart, There is no God;” and seems to have the sentiments of natural conscience, as to God, stifled in
him (Psalm 14:1, 4): it must arise from a conceit that there is no God, or that we are equal to him,
adoration not being due from persons of an equal state; or that God is unable, or unwilling to take notice
of the adoring acts of his creatures: what is any of these but an undeifying the supreme Majesty? When
we lay aside all thoughts of paying any homage to him, we are in a fair way opinionatively to deny him,
as much as we practically disown him. Where there is no knowledge of God, that is, no “acknowledgment
of God,” a gap is opened to all licentiousness (Hos. 4:1, 2); and that by degrees brawns the conscience,
and razeth out the sense of God. Those forsake God that “forget his holy mountain” (Isa. 65:11); they do
not practically own him as the Creator of their souls or bodies. It is the sin of Cain, who turning his back
upon worship, is said to “go out from the presence of the Lord” (Gen. 4:16). Not to worship him with our
spirits, is against his law of creation: not to worship him at all, is against his act of creation; not to
worship him in truth, is hypocrisy; not to worship him at all, is atheism; whereby we render ourselves
worse than the worms in the earth, or a toad in a ditch.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) To perform a worship to a false God, or to the true God in a false manner, seems to be less a sin
than to live in perpetual neglect of it. Though it be directed to a false object instead of God, yet it is under
the notion of a God, and so is an acknowledgment of such a Being as God in the world; whereas the total
neglect of any worship, is a practical denying of the existence of any supreme Majesty. Whosoever
constantly omits a public and private worship, transgresses against an universally received dictate; for all
nations have agreed in the common notion of worshipping God, though they have disagreed in the several
modes and rites whereby they would testify that adoration. By a worship of God, though superstitious, a
veneration and reverence of such a being is maintained in the world; whereas by a total neglect of
worship, he is virtually disowned and discarded, if not from his existence, yet from his providence and
government of the world; all the mercies we breathe in are denied to flow from him. A foolish worship
owns religion, though it bespatters it; as if a stranger coming into a country mistakes the subject for the
prince, and pays that reverence to the subject which is due to the prince; though he mistakes the object,
yet he owns an authority; or if he pays any respect to the true prince of that country after the mode of his
own, though appearing ridiculous in the place where he is, he owns the authority of the prince; whereas
the omission of all respect would be a contempt of majesty: and, therefore, the judgments of God have
been more signal upon the sacrilegious contemners of worship among the heathens, than upon those that
were diligent and devout in their false worship; and they generally owned the blessings received to the
preservation of a sense and worship of a Deity among them. Though such a worship be not acceptable to
God, and every man is bound to offer to God a devotion agreeable to his own mind; yet it is
commendable, not as worship, but as it speaks an acknowledgment of such a being as God, in his power
and creation, and his beneficence in his trovidence. Well, then, omissions of worship are to be avoided.
Let no man execute that upon himself which God will pronounce at last as the greatest misery, and bid
God depart from him, who will at last be loth to hear God bid him depart from him. Though man hath
natural sentiments that God is to be worshipped, yet having an hostility in his nature, he is apt to neglect,
or give it him in a slight manner; he therefore sets a particular mark and notice of attention upon the
fourth command, “Remember thou keep holy the Sabhath day.” Corrupt nature is apt to neglect the
worship of God, and flag in it. This command, therefore, which concerns his worship, he fortifies with
several reasons. Nor let any neglect worship, because they cannot find their hearts spiritual in it. The
further we are from God, the more carnal shall we be. No man can expect heat by a distance from the
sunbeams, or other means of warmth. Though God commanded a circumcised heart in the Jewish
services, yet he did not warrant a neglect of the outward testimonies of reigion he had then appointed. He
expected, according to his command, that they should offer the sacrifices, and practise the legal
purification he had commanded; he would have them diligently observed, though he had declared that he
imposed them only for a time; and our Saviour ordered the practice of those positive rites as long as the
law remained unrepealed, as in the case of the leper (Mark 14:4). It is an injustice to refuse the offering
ourselves to God according to the manner he hath in his wisdom prescribed and required. If spiritual
worship be required by God, then,
</p>
<p>
    2. It informs us, that diligence in outward worship is not to be rested in. Men may attend all their days
on worship, with a juiceless heart and unquickened frame, and think to compensate the neglect of the
manner with abundance of the matter of service.525 Outward expressions are but the badges and liveries of
service, not the service itself. As the strength of sin lies in the inward frame of the heart, so the strength of
worship in the inward complexion and temper of the soul. What do a thousand services avail, without
cutting the throat of our carnal affections? What are loud prayers, but as sounding brass and tinkling
cymbals, without divine charity? A pharisaical diligence in outward forms, without inward spirit, had no
better a title vouchsafed by our Saviour than that of hypocritical. God desires not sacrifices, nor delights
in burnt-offerings: shadows are not to be offered instead of substance. God required the heart of man for
itself, but commanded outward ceremonies as subservient to inward worship, and goads and spurs unto it.
They were never appointed as the substance of religion, but auxiliaries to it. What value had the offering
of the human nature of Christ been of, if he had not had a divine nature to qualify him to be the Priest?
and what is the oblation of our bodies, without a priestly act of the spirit in the presentation of it? Could
the Israelites have called themselves worshippers of God according to his order, if they had brought a
thousand lambs that had died in a ditch, or been killed at home? They were to be brought living to the
altar; the blood shed at the foot of it. A thousand sacrifices killed without had not been so valuable as one
brought alive to the place of offering: one sound sacrifice is better than a thousand rotten ones. As God
took no pleasure in the blood of beasts without its relation to the Antitype; so he takes no pleasure in the
outward rites of worship, without faith in the Redeemer. To offer a body with a sapless spirit, is a
sacrilege of the same nature with that of the Israelites when they offered dead beasts. A man without
spiritual worship is dead while he worships, though by his diligence in the externals of it, he may, like the
angel of the church of Sardis, “have a name to live” (Rev. 3:1). What security can we expect from a
multitude of dead services? What weak shields are they against the holy eye and revenging wrath of God!
What man, but one out of his wits, would solicit a dead man to be his advocate or champion? Diligence in
outward worship is not to be rested in.
</p>
<p>
    Use II. shall be for examination. Let us try ourselves concerning the manner of our worship. We are
now in the end of the world, and the dregs of time; wherein the apostle predicts there may be much of a
form, and little of the power of godliness (2 Tim. 3:1, 5); and, therefore, it stands us in hand to search into
ourselves, whether it be not thus with us? whether there be as much reverence in our spirits as there may
be devotion in our countenances and outward carriages.
</p>
<p>
    1. How, therefore, are our hearts prepared to worship? Is our diligence greater to put our hearts in an
adoring posture, than our bodies in a decent garb? or are we content to have a muddy heart, so we may
have a dressed carcass? To have a spirit a cage of unclean birds, while we wipe the filth from the outside
of the platter, is no better than a pharisaical devotion, and deserves no better a name than that of a whited
sepulchre. Do we take opportunities to excite and quicken our spirits to the performance, and cry aloud
with David, “Awake, awake, my glory!” Are not our hearts asleep when Christ knocks? When we hear the
voice of God, “Seek my face;” do we answer him with warm resolutions, “Thy face, Lord, we will seek?”
(Psalm 27:8.) Do we comply with spiritual motions, and strike whilst the iron is hot? Is there not more of
reluctancy than readiness? Is there a quick rising of the soul in reverence to the motion, as Eglon to Ehud;
or a sullen hanging the head at the first approach of it? Or if our hearts seem to be engaged and on fire,
what are the motives that quicken that fire? Is it only the blast of a natural conscience, fear of hell, desires
of heaven, as abstracted from God? or is it an affection to God; an obedient will to please him; longings to
enjoy him, as a holy and sanctifying God in his ordinances, as well as a blessed and glorified God in
heaven? What do we expect in our approaches from him? that which may make divine impressions upon
us, and more exactly conform us to the Divine nature? or do we design nothing but an empty formality, a
rolling eye, and a filling the air with a few words, without any openings of heart to receive the incomes,
which, according to the nature of the duty, might be conveyed to us? Can this be a spiritual worship? The
soul then closely waits upon him, when its expectation is only from him (Psalm 62:6). Are our hearts
seasoned with a sense of sin; a sight of our spiritual wants; raised notions of God; lowing affections to
him; strong appetite after a spiritual fulness Do we rouse up our sleepy spirits, and make a covenant with
all that is within us to attend upon him? So much as we want of this, so much we come short of a spiritual
worship. In Psalm 57:7 (“My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed”), David would fix his heart, before
he would engage in a praising act of worship. He appeals to God about it, and that with doubling the
expression, as being certain of an inward preparedness. Can we make the same appeals in a fixation of
spirit?
</p>
<p>
     2. How are our hearts fixed upon him; how do they cleave to him in the duty? Do we resign our spirits
to God, and make them an entire holocaust, a whole burnt-offering in his worship? or do we not willingly
admit carnal thoughts to mix themselves with spiritual duties, and fasten our minds to the creature, under
pretences of directing them to the Creator? Do we not pass a mere compliment upon God, by some
superficial act of devotion; while some covetous, envious, ambitious, voluptuous imagination may
possess our minds? Do we not invert God’s order, and worship a lust instead of God with our spirits, that
should not have the least service, either from our souls or bodies, but with a spiritual disdain be sacrificed
to the just indignation of God? How often do we fight against his will, while we cry, “Hail, Master!”
instead of crucifying our own thoughts, crucifying the Lord of our lives; our outward carriage plausible,
and our inward stark naught! Do we not often regard iniquity more than God in our hearts, in a time of
worship?—roll some filthy imagination as a sweet morsel under our tongues, and taste more sweetness in
that than in God? Do not our spirits smell rank of earth, while we offer to heaven; and have we not hearts
full of thick clay, as their “hands were full of blood?” (Isa. 1:15.) When we sacrifice, do we not wrap up
our souls in communion with some sordid fancy, when we should entwine our spirits about an amiable
God? While we have some fear of him, may we not have a love to something else above him? This is to
worship, or swear by the Lord, and by Malcham (Zeph. 1:5). How often doth an apish fancy render a
service inwardly ridiculous, under a grave outward posture; skipping to the shop, warehouse, counting-
house, in the space of a short prayer! and we are before God as a Babel, a confusion of internal languages;
and this in those parts of worship which are, in the right use, most agreeable to God, profitable for
ourselves, ruinous to the kingdom of sin and Satan, and means to bring us into a closer communion with
the Divine Majesty. Can this be a spiritual worship?
</p>
<p>
     3. How do we act our graces in worship? Though the instrument be strung, if the strings be not wound
up, what melody can be the issue? All readiness and alacrity discover a strength of nature; and a readiness
in spirituals discovers a spirituality in the heart. As unaffecting thoughts of God are not spiritual thoughts,
so unaffecting addresses to God are not spiritual addresses. Well, then, what awakenings, and elevations
of faith and love have we? What strong outflowings of our souls to him? What indignation against sin?
What admirations of redeeming grace? How low have we brought our corruptions to the footstool of
Christ, to be made his conquered enemies? How straitly have we clasped our faith about the cross and
throne of Christ, to become his intimate spouse? Do we in hearing hang upon the lips of Christ; in prayer
take hold of God, and will not let him go; in confessions rend the caul of our hearts, and indite our souls
before him with a deep humility? Do we act more by a soaring love than a drooping fear? So far as our
spirits are servile, so far they are legal and carnal; so much as they are free and spontaneous, so much they
are evangelical and spiritual. As men under the law are subject to the constraint of “bondage all their life-
time” (Heb. 2:15), in all their worship; so under the gospel they are under a constraint of love (2 Cor.
5:14): how then are believing affections exercised, which are alway accompanied with holy fear; a fear of
his goodness that admits us into his presence, and a fear to offend him in our act of worship? So much as
we have of forced or feeble affection, so much we have of carnality.
</p>
<p>
    4. How do we find our hearts after worship? By an after carriage we may judge of the spirituality of it.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) How are we as to inward strength? When a worship is spiritually performed, grace is more
strengthened, corruption more mortified; the soul, like Samson after his awakening, goes out with a
renewed strength; as the inward man is renewed day by day, that is, every day; so it is renewed in every
worship. Every shower makes the grass and fruit grow in good ground where the root is good, and the
weeds where the ground is naught; the more prepared the heart is to obedience in other duties after
worship, the more evidence there is that it hath been spiritual in the exercise of it. It is the end of God in
every dispensation, as in that of John Baptist, “to make ready a people prepared for the Lord” (Luke
1:17): when the heart is by worship prepared for fresh acts of obedience, and hath a more exact
watchfulness against the encroachments of sin. As carnal men after worship sprout up in spiritual
wickedness, so do spiritual worshippers in spiritual graces; spiritual fruits are a sign of a spiritual frame.
When men are more prone to sin after duty, it is a sign there was but little communion with God in it; and
a greater strength of sin, because such an act is contrary to the end of worship which is the subduing of
sin. It is a sign the physic hath wrought well, when the stomach hath a better appetite to its appointed
food; and worship hath been well performed, when we have a stronger inclination to other acts well
pleasing to God, and a more sensible distaste of those temptations we too much relished before. It is a
sign of a good concoction, when there is a greater strength in the vitals of religion, a more eager desire to
know God. When Moses had been praying to God, and prevailed with him, he puts up a higher request to
“behold his glory” (Exod. 33:13, 18): when the appetite stands strong to fuller discoveries of God, it is a
sign there hath been a spiritual converse with him.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) How is it especially as to humility? The Pharisees’ worship was, without dispute, carnal; and we
find them not more humble after all their devotions, but overgrown with more weeds of spiritual pride;
they performed them as their righteousness. What men dare plead before God in his day, they plead
before him in their hearts in their day; but this men will do at the day of judgment: “We have prophesied
in thy name,” &amp;c. (Matt. 7:21). They show what tincture their services left upon their spirits; that which
excludes them from any acceptation at the last day, excludes them from any estimation of being spiritual
in this day. The carnal worshippers charge God with injustice in not rewarding them, and claim an
acceptation as a compensation due to them (Isa. 58:3): “Wherefore have we afflicted our souls, and thou
takest no knowledge?” A spiritual worshipper looks upon his duties with shame, as well as he doth upon
his sins with confusion; and implores the mercy of God for the one as well as the other. In Psalm 143:2,
the prophet David, after his supplications, begs of God not to enter into judgment with him; and
acknowledges any answer that God should give him, as a fruit of his faithfulness to his promise, and not
the merit of his worship: “In thy faithfulness answer me,” &amp;c. Whatsoever springs from a gracious
principle, and is the breath of the Spirit, leaves a man more humble; whereas, that which proceeds from a
stock of nature, hath the true blood of nature running in the veins of it; viz., that pride which is naturally
derived from Adam. The breathing of the Divine Spirit is, in everything, to conform us to our Redeemer;
that being the main work of his office, is his work in every particular christian act influenced by him.
Now Jesus Christ, in all his actions, was an exact pattern of all humility. After the institution and
celebration of the supper, a special act of worship in the church, though he had a sense of all the authority
his Father had given him, yet he “humbles himself to wash his disciples’ feet” (John 13:2–4); and after his
sublime prayer (John 17.), “He humbles himself to the death, and offers himself” to his murderers,
because of his Father’s pleasure. (John 18:1): “When he had spoken those words, he went over the brook
Kedron into the garden.” What is the end of God in appointing worship, is the end of a spiritual heart in
offering it; not his own exaltation, but God’s glory. Glorifying the name of God is the fruit of that
evangelical worship the Gentiles were in time to give to God (Psalm 86:9): “All nations which thou hast
made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.” Let us examine, then,
what debasing ourselves there is in a sense of our own vileness, and distance from so glorious a Spirit.
Self-denial is the heart of all gospel grace. Evangelical, spiritual worship cannot be without the ingredient
of the main evangelical principle.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) What delight is there after it? What pleasure is there, and what is the object of that pleasure? Is it
the communion we have had with God, or a fluency in ourselves? Is it something which hath touched our
hearts, or tickled our fancies? As the strength of sin is known by the delightful thoughts of it after the
commission; so is the spirituality of duty, by the object of our delightful remembrance after the
performance. It was a sign David was spiritual in the worship of God in the tabernacle, when he enjoyed
it, because he longed for the spiritual part of it, when he was exiled from it; his desires were not only for
liberty to revisit the tabernacle, but to see the “power and glory of God in the sanctuary,” as he had seen it
before (Psalm 63:2): his desires for it could not have been so ardent, if his reflection upon what had past
had not been delightful; nor could his soul be poured out in him, for the want of such opportunities, if the
remembrance of the converse he had had with God, had not been accompanied with a delightful relish
(Psalm 42:4). Let us examine what delight we find in our spirits after worship.
</p>
<p>
     Use III. is of comfort. And it is very comfortable to consider, that the smallest worship with the heart
and spirit, flowing from a principle of grace, is more acceptable than the most pompous veneration; yea, if
the oblation were as precious as the whole circuit of heaven and earth without it. That God that values a
cup of cold water given to any as his disciple, will value a sincere service above a costly sacrifice. God
hath his eye upon them that honor his nature; he would not “seek such to worship him,” if he did not
intend to accept such a worship from them; when we therefore invoke him, and praise him, which are the
prime parts of religion, he will receive it as a sweet savor from us, and overlook infirmities mixed with
the graces. The great matter of discomfort, and that which makes us question the spirituality of worship, is
the many starts of our spirits, and rovings to other things. For answer to which,
</p>
<p>
     1. It is to be confessed that these starts are natural to us. Who is free from them? We bear in our
bosoms a nest of turbulent thoughts, which, like busy gnats, will be buzzing about us while we are in our
most inward and spiritual converses. Many wild beasts lurk in a man’s heart, as in a close and covert
wood, and scarce discover themselves but at our solemn worship. No duty so holy, no worship so
spiritual, that can wholly privilege us from them; they will jog ua in our most weighty employments, that,
as God said to Cain, sin lies at the door, and enters m, and makes a riot in our souls. As it is said of
wicked men, “they cannot sleep” for multitude of thoughts (Eccles. 5:12); so it may. be of many a good
man, he cannot worship for multitude of thoughts; there will be starts, and more in our religious than
natural employments; it is natural to man. Some therefore think, the bells tied to Aaron’s garments,
between the pomegranates, were to warn the people, and recall their fugitive minds to the present service,
when they heard the sound of them, upon the least motion of the high-priest. The sacrifice of Abraham,
the father or the faithful, was not exempt from the fowls pecking at it (Gen. 15:11). Zechariah himself was
drowsy in the midst of his visions, which being more amazing, might cause a heavenly intentness (Zech.
4:1): “The angel that talked with me, came again and awaked me, as a man is awaked out of sleep.” He
had been roused up before, but he was ready to drop down again; his heart was gone, till the angel jogged
him. We may complain of such imaginations, as Jeremiah doth of the enemies of the Jews (Lam. 4:19).
Our persecutors are swifter than eagles; they light upon us with as much speed as eagles upon a carcass;
they pursue us upon the mountain of divine institutions, and they lay wait for us in the wilderness, in our
retired addresses to God. And this will be so while,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) There is natural corruption in us. There are in a godly man two contrary principles, flesh and
spirit, which endeavor to hinder one another’s acts, and are alway stirring upon the offensive or defensive
part (Gal. 5:17). There is a body of death, continually exhaling its noisome vapors: it is a body of death in
our worship, as well as in our natures; it snaps our resolutions asunder (Rom. 7:19); it hinders us in the
doing good, and contradicts our wills in the stirring up evil. This corruption being seated in all the
faculties, and a constant domestic in them, has the greater opportunity to trouble us, since it is by those
faculties that we spiritually transact with God; and it stirs more in the time of religious exercises, though it
be in part mortified; as a wounded beast, though tired, will rage and strive to its utmost, when the enemy
is about to fetch a blow at it. All duties of worship tend to the wounding of corruption; and it is no wonder
to feel the striving of sin to defend itself and offend us, when we have our arms in our hands to mortify it,
that the blow may be diverted which is directed against it. The apostles had aspiring thoughts; and being
persuaded of an earthly kingdom, expected a grandeur in it; and though we find some appearance of it at
other times, as when they were casting out devils, and gave an account of it to their Master, he gives them
a kind of a check (Luke 10:20), intimating that there was some kind of evil in their rejoicing upon that
account; yet this never swelled so high, as to break out into a quarrel who should be greatest, until they
had the most solemn ordinance, the Lord’s supper, to quell it (Luke 22:24). Our corruption is like lime,
which discovers not its fire by any smoke or heat, till you cast water, the enemy of fire, upon it; neither
doth our natural corruption rage so much, as when we are using means to quench and destroy it.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) While there is a devil, and we in his precinct. As he accuseth us to God, so he disturbs us in
ourselves; he is a bold spirit, and loves to intrude himself when we are conversing with God: we read, that
when the angels presented themselves before God, Satan comes among them (Job 1:6). Motions from
Satan will thrust themselves in with our most raised and angelical frames; he loves to take off the edge of
our spirits from God; he acts but after the old rate; he from the first envied God an obedience from man,
and envied man the felicity of communion with God; he is unwilling God should have the honor of
worship, and that we should have the fruit of it; he hath himself lost it, and therefore is unwilling we
should enjoy it; and being subtle, he knows how to make impressions upon us suitable to our inbred
corruptions, and assault us in the weakest part. He knows all the avenues to get within us (as he did in the
temptation of Eve), and being a spirit, he wants not a power to dart them immediately upon our fancy; and
being a spirit, and therefore active and nimble, he can shoot those darts faster than our weakness can beat
them off. He is diligent also, and watcheth for his prey, and seeks to devour our services as well as our
souls, and snatch our best morsels from us. We know he mixed himself with our Saviour’s retirements in
the wilderness, and endeavored to fly-blow his holy converse with his Father in the preparation to his
mediatory work. Satan is God’s ape, and imitates the Spirit in the office of a remembrancer; as the Spirit
brings good thoughts and divine promises to mind, to quicken our worship, so the devil brings evil things
to mind, and endeavors to fasten them in our souls to disturb us; and though all the foolish starts we have
in worship are not purely his issue, yet being of kin to him, he claps his hands, and sets them on like so
many mastiffs, to tear the service in pieces. And both those distractions, which arise from our own
corruption and from Satan, are most rife in worship, when we are under some pressing affliction. This
seems to be David’s case, Psalm 86: when in ver. 11 he prays God to unite his heart to fear and worship
his name; he seems to be under some affliction, or fear of his enemies: “O free me from those distractions
of spirit, and those passions which arise in my soul, upon considering the designs of my enemies against
me, and press upon me in my addresses to thee, and attendances on thee.” Job also in his affliction
complains (Job 17:11) that “his purposes were broken off;” he could not make an even thread of thoughts
and resolutions; they were frequently snapt asunder, like rotten yarn when one is winding it up. Good men
and spiritual worshippers have lain under this trouble. Though they are a sign of weakness of grace, or
some obstructions in the acting of strong grace, yet they are not alway evidences of a want of grace; what
ariseth from our own corruption, is to be matter of humiliation and resistance; what ariseth from Satan,
should edge our minds to a noble conquest of them. If the apostle did comfort himself with his
disapproving of what rose from the natural spring of sin within him, with his consent to the law, and
dissent from his lust; and charges it not upon himself, but upon the sin that dwelt in him, with which he
had broken off the former league, and was resolved never to enter into amity with it; by the same reason
we may comfort ourselves, if such thoughts are undelighted in, and alienate not our hearts from the
worship of God by all their busy intrusions to interrupt us.
</p>
<p>
     2. These distractions (not allowed) may be occasions, by an holy improvement, to make our hearts
more spiritual after worship, though they disturb us in it, by answering those ends for which we may
suppose God permits them to invade us. And that is,
</p>
<p>
     First, When they are occasions to humble us,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) For our carriage in the particular worship. There is nothing so dangerous as spiritual pride; it
deprived devils and men of the presence of God, and will hinder us of the influence of God. If we had had
raised and uninterrupted motions in worship, we should be apt to be lifted up; and the evil stands read to
tempt us to self-confidence. You know how it was with Paul (2 Cor. 12:1–7); his buffetings were
occasions to render him more spiritual than his raptures, because more humble. God suffers those
wanderings, starts, and distractions, to prevent our spiritual pride; which is as a worm at the root of
spiritual worship, and mind us of the dusty frame of our spirits, how easily they are blown away; as he
sends sickness to put us in mind of the shortness of our breath, and the easiness to lose it. God would
make us ashamed of ourselves in his presence; that we may own, that what is good in any duty, is merely
from his grace and Spirit, and not from ourselves; that with Paul we may cry out, “By grace we are what
we are,” and by grace we do what we do; we may be hereby made sensible, that God can alway find
something in our exactest worship, as a ground of denying us the successful fruit of it. If we cannot stand
upon our duties for salvation, what can we bottom upon in ourselves? If therefore they are occasions to
make us out of love with any righteousness of our own, to make us break our hearts for them, because we
cannot keep them out; if we mourn for them as our sins, and count them our great afflictions, we have
attained that brokenness which is a choice ingredient in a spiritual sacrifice. Though we have been
disturbed by them, yet we are not robbed of the success; we may behold an answer of our worship in our
humiliation, in spite of all of them.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) For the baseness of our nature. These unsteady motions help us to discern that heap of vermin that
breeds in our nature. Would any man think he had such an averseness to his Creator and Benefactor; such
an unsuitableness to him; such an estrangedness from him, were it not for his inspection into his distracted
frame? God suffers this to hang over us as a rod of correction, to discover and fetch out the folly of our
hearts. Could we imagine our natures so highly contrary to that God who is so infinitely amiable, so
desirable an object; or that there should be so much folly and madness in the heart, as to draw back from
God in those services which God hath appointed as pipes through which to communicate his grace, to
convey himself, his love and goodness to the creature? If, therefore, we have a deep sense of, and strong
reflections upon our base nature, and bewail that mass of averseness which lies there, and that fulness of
irreverence towards the God of our mercies, the object of our worship, it is a blessed improvement of our
wanderings and diversions. Certainly, if any Israelite had brought a lame and rotten lamb to be sacrificed
to God, and afterward had bewailed it, and laid open his heart to God in a sensible and humble confession
of it, that repentance had been a better sacrifice, and more acceptable in the sight of God, than if be had
brought a sound and a living offering.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly, When they are occasions to make us prize duties of worship. When we argue, as rationally
we may, that they are of singular use, since our corrupt hearts and a malicious devil doth chiefly endeavor
to hinder us from them, and that we find we have not those gadding thoughts when we are upon worldly
business, or upon any sinful design which may dishonor God and wound our souls. This is a sign sin and
Satan dislike worship, for he is too subtle a spirit to oppose that which would further his kingdom. As it is
an argument the Scripture is the word of God, because the wickedness of the world doth so much oppose
it, so it is a ground to believe the profitableness and excellency of worship, because Satan and our own
unruly hearts do so much interrupt us in it: if, therefore, we make this use of our cross-steps in worship, to
have a greater value for such duties, more affections to them, and desires to be frequent in them, our
hearts are growing spiritual under the weights that would depress them to carnality.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, When we take a rise from hence, to have heavenly admirations of the graciousness of God,
that he should pity and pardon so many slight addresses to him, and give any gracious returns to us.
Though men have foolish rangings every day, and in every duty, yet free grace is so tender as not to
punish them (Gen. 8:21): “And the Lord smelt a sweet savor; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not
curse the ground for man’s sake, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth.” It is
observable, that this was just after a sacrifice which Noah offered to God (ver. 20): but probably not
without infirmities common to human nature, which may be grounded upon the reason God gives, that
though he had destroyed the earth before, because of the “evil of man’s imaginations” (Gen. 6:5), he still
found evil imaginations; he doth not say in the heart of Cham, or others of Noah’s family, but in man’s
heart, including Noah also, who had both the judgments of God upon the former world, and the mercy of
God in his own preservation, before his eyes; yet God saw evil imaginations rooted in the nature of man,
and though it were so, yet he would be merciful. If, therefore, we can, after finding our hearts so vagrant
in worship, have real frames of thankfulness that God hath spared us, and be heightened in our
admirations at God’s giving us any fruit of such a distracted worship, we take advantage from them to be
raised into an evangelical frame, which consists in the humble acknowledgments of the grace of God.
When David takes a review of those tumultuous passions which bad rued his mind, and possessed him
with unbelieving notions of God in the persons of his prophets (Psalm 116:11), how high doth his soul
mount in astonishment and thankfulness to God for his mercy! (ver. 12.) Notwithstanding his distrust,
God did graciously perform his promise, and answer his desire: then it is, “What shall I render to the
Lord?” His heart was more affected for it, because it had been so passionate in former distrusts. It is
indeed a ground of wondering at the patience of the Spirit of God, that he should guide our hearts when
they are so apt to start out, as it is the patience of a master to guide the hand of his scholar, while he mixes
his writing with many blots. It is not one or two infirmities the Spirit helps us in, and helps over, but many
(Rom. 8:26). It is a sign of a spiritual heart, when he can take a rise to bless God for the renewing and
blowing up his affections, in the midst of so many incursions from Satan to the contrary, and the readiness
of the heart too much to comply with them.
</p>
<p>
    Fourthly, When we take occasion from thence to prize the mediation of Christ. The more distractions
jog us, the more need we should see of going out to a Saviour by faith. One part of our Saviour’s office is
to stand between us and the infirmities of our worship. As he is an advocate, he presents our services, and
pleads for them and us (1 John 2:1), for the sins of our duties, as well as for our other sins. Jesus Christ is
an High-priest, appointed by God to take away the “iniquities of our holy things,” which was typified by
Aaron’s plate upon his mitre (Exod. 28:36, 38). Were there no imperfections, were there no creeping up
of those frogs into our minds, we should think our worship might merit acceptance with God upon its own
account; but if we behold our own weakness, that not a tear, a groan, a sigh, is so pure, but must have
Christ to make it entertainable; that there is no worship without those blemishes; and upon this, throw all
our services into the arms of Christ for acceptance, and solicit him to put his merits in the front, to make
our ciphers appear valuable; it is a spiritual act, the design of God in the gospel being to advance the
honor and mediation of his Son. That is a spiritual and evangelical act which answers the evangelical
design. The design of Satan, and our own corruption is defeated, when those interruptions make us run
swifter, and take faster hold on the High-priest who is to present our worship to God, and our own souls
receive comfort thereby. Christ had temptations offered to him by the devil in his wilderness retirement,
that, from an experimental knowledge, he might be able more “compassionately to succor us” (Heb.
2:18); we have such assaults in our retired worship especially, that we may be able more highly to value
him and his mediation.
</p>
<p>
     3. Let us not, therefore, be discouraged by those interruptions and starts of our hearts.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) If we find in ourselves a strong resistance of them. The flesh will be lusting; that cannot be
hindered; yet if we do not fulfil the lusts of it, rise up at its command, and go about its work, we may be
said to walk in the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 17): we “walk in the Spirit,” if we “fulfil not the lusts of the flesh,”
though there be a lusting of the flesh against the Spirit; so we worship in the Spirit, though there be carnal
thoughts arising if we do not fulfil them; though the stirring of them discovers some contrariety in us to
God, yet the resistance manifests that there is a principle of contrariety in us to them; that as there is
something of flesh that lusts against the spirit, so there is something of spirit in worship which lusts
against the flesh: we must take heed of omitting worship, because of such inroads, and lying down in the
mire of a total neglect. If our spirits are made more lively and vigorous against them; if those cold vapors
which have risen from our hearts make us, like a spring in the midst of the cold earth, more warm, there
is, in this case, more reason for us to bless God, than to be discouraged. God looks upon it as the disease,
not the wilfulness of our nature; as the weakness of the flesh, not the willingness of the spirit. If we would
shut the door upon them, it seems they are unwelcome company; men do not use to lock their doors upon
those they love; if they break in and disturb us with their impertinences, we need not be discomforted,
unless we give them a share in our affections, and turn our back upon God to entertain them; if their
presence makes us sad, their flight would make us joyful.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) If we find ourselves excited to a stricter watch over our hearts against them; as travellers will be
careful when they come to places where they have been robbed before, that they be not so easily surprised
again. We should not only lament when we have had such foolish imaginations in worship breaking in
upon us, but also bless God that we have had no more, since we have hearts so fruitful of weeds. We
should give God the glory when we find our hearts preserved from these intruders, and not boast of
ourselves, but return him our praise for the watch and guard he kept over us, to preserve us from such
thieves. Let us not be discomforted; for as the greatness of our sins, upon our turning to God, is no
hindrance to our justification, because it doth not depend upon our conversion as the meritorious cause,
but upon the infinite value of our Saviour’s satisfaction, which reaches the greatest sins as well as the
least; so the multitude of our bewailed distractions in worship are not a hindrance to our acceptation,
because of the uncontrollable power of Christ’s intercession.
</p>
<p>
     Use IV. is for exhortation. Since spiritual worship is due to God, and the Father seeks such to worship
him, how much should we endeavor to satisfy the desire and order of God, and act conformable to the law
of our creation and the love of redemption! Our end must be the same in worship which was God’s end in
creation and redemption; to glorify his name, set forth his perfections, and be rendered fit, as creatures
and redeemed ones, to partake of that grace which is the fruit of worship. An evangelical dispensation
requires a spiritual homage; to neglect, therefore, either the matter or manner of gospel duties, is to put a
slight upon gospel privileges. The manner of duty is ever of more value than the matter; the scarlet dye is
more precious than the doth tinctured with it. God respects more the disposition of the sacrificer than the
multitude of the sacrifices.526 The solemn feasts appointed by God were but dung as managed by the Jews
(Mal. 2:3). The heart is often welcome without the body, but the body never grateful without the heart.
The inward acts of the spirit require nothing from without to constitute them good in themselves; but the
outward acts of devotion require inward acts to render them savory to God. As the goodness of outward
acts consists not in the acts themselves, so the acceptableness of them results not from the acts
themselves, but from the inward frame animating and quickening those acts, as blood and spirits running
through the veins of a duty to make it a living service in the sight of God. Imperfections in worship hinder
not God’s acceptation of it, if the heart, spirited by grace, be there to make it a sweet savor. The stench of
burning flesh and fat in the legal sacrifices might render them noisome to the outward senses; but God
smelt a sweet savor in them, as they respected Christ. When the heart and spirit are offered up to God, it
may be a savory duty, though attended with unsavory imperfections; but a thousand sacrifices without a
stamp of faith, a thousand spiritual duties with an habitual carnality, are no better than stench with God.
The heart must be purged, as well as the temple was by our Saviour, of the thieves that would rob God of
his due worship. Antiquity had some temples wherein it was a crime to bring’ any gold; therefore those
that came to worship laid their gold aside before they went into the temple. We should lay aside our
worldly and trading thoughts before we address to worship (Isa. 26:9) “With my spirit within me will I
seek thee early.” Let not our minds be gadding abroad, and exiled from God and themselves. It will be
thus when the “desire of our soul is to his name, and the remembrance of him” (ver. 8). When he hath
given so great and admirable a gift as that of his Son, in whom are all things necessary to salvation,
righteousness, peace, and pardon of sin, we should manage the remembrance of his name in worship with
the closest unitedness of heart, and the most spiritual affections. The motion of the spirit is the first act in
religion; to this we are obliged in every act. The devil requires the spirit of his votaries; should God have
a less dedication than the devil?
</p>
<p>
     Motives to back this exhortation.
</p>
<p>
     I. Not to give God our spirit is a great sin. It is a mockery of God, not worship, contempt, not
adoration, whatever our outward fervency or protestations may be.527 Every alienation of our hearts from
him is a real scorn put upon him. The acts of the soul are real, and more the acts of the man than the acts
of the body; because they are the acts of the choicest part of man, and of that which is the first spring of
all bodily motions; it is the λόγος ἐνδιαθετος, the internal speech whereby we must speak with God. To
give him, therefore, only an external form of worship without the life of it, is a taking his name in vain.
We mock him, when we mind not what we are speaking to him, or what he is speaking to us; when the
motions of our hearts are contrary to the motions of our tongues; when we do anything before him
slovenly, impudently, or rashly. As in a lutinist it is absurd to sing one tune and play another; so it is a
foul thing to tell God one thing with our lips, and think another with our hearts. It is a sin like that the
apostle chargeth the heathens with (Rom. 1:28) “They like not to retain God in their knowledge” Their
stomachs are sick while they are upon any duty, and never leave working till they have thrown up all the
spiritual part of worship, and rid themselves of the thoughts of God, which are as unwelcome and
troublesome guests to them. When men behave themselves in the sight of God, as if God were not God,
they do not only defame him, but deny him, and violate the unchangeable perfections of the Divine
nature.
</p>
<p>
     1. It is against the majesty of God, when we have not awful thoughts of that great Majesty to whom
we address; when our souls cleave not to him when we petition him in prayer, or when he gives out his
orders to us in his Word. It is a contempt of the majesty of a prince, if, whilst he is speaking to us, we
listen not to him with reverence and attention, but turn our backs on him, to play with one of his hounds,
or talk with a beggar; or while we speak to him, to rake in a dunghill. Solomon adviseth us to “keep our
foot when we go to the house of God” (Eccles. 5:1). Our affections should be steady, and not slip away
again; why? (ver. 2 because “God is in heaven,” &amp;c. He is a God of majesty; earthly, dirty frames are
unsuitable to the God of heaven; low spirits are unsuitable to the Most High. We would not bring our
mean servants or dirty dogs into a prince’s presence chamber; yet we bring not only our worldly, but our
profane affections into God’s presence. We give in this case those services to God which our Governor
would think unworthy of him (Mal. 1:8). The more excellent and glorious God is, the greater contempt of
him it is to suffer such foolish affections to be competitors with him for our hearts. It is a scorn put upon
him to converse with a creature, while we are dealing with him; but a greater to converse in our thoughts
and fancies with some sordid lust, which is most hateful to him; and the more aggravation it attracts, in
that we are to apprehend him the most glorious object sitting upon his throne in time of worship, and
ourselves standing as vile creatures before him, supplicating for our lives, and the conveyance of grace
and mercy to our souls; as if a grand mutineer, instead of humbly begging the pardon of his offended
prince, should present his petition not only scribbled and blotted, but besmeared with some loathsome
excrement. It is unbecoming both the majesty of God, and the worship itself, to present him with a picture
instead of a substance, and bring a world of nasty affections in our hearts, and ridiculous toys in our heads
before him, and worship with indisposed and heedless souls. He is a great King (Mal. 1:14): therefore
address to him with fear and reverence.
</p>
<p>
     2. It is against the life of God. Is a dead worship proportioned to a living God? The separation of
heavenly affections from our souls before God, makes them as much a carcass in his sight, as the divorce
of the soul makes the body a carcass. When the affections are separated, worship is no longer worship, but
a dead offering, a lifeless bulk; for the essence and spirit of worship is departed. Though the soul be
present with the body in a way of information, yet it is not present in a way of affection, and this is the
worst; for it is not the separation of the soul from informing that doth separate a man from God, but the
removal of our affections from him. If a man pretend an application to God, and sleep and snore all the
time, without question such a one did not worship. In a careless worship the heart is morally dead while
the eyes are open: the heart of the spouse (Cant. 5:2) waked while her eyes slept; and our hearts, on the
contrary, sleep while our eyes wake. Our blessed Saviour hath died to purge our consciences from dead
works and frames, that we may serve the living God (Heb. 9:14); to serve God as a God of life. David’s
soul cried and fainted for God under this consideration (Psalm 42:2); but to present our bodies without our
spirits, is such a usage of God, that implies he is a dead image, not worthy of any but a dead and heartless
service, like one of those idols the Psalmist speaks of (Psalm 115:5), that have “eyes, and see not; ears,
and hear not;” no life in it. Though it be not an objective idolatry, because the worship is directed to the
true God; yet I may call it a subjective idolatry in regard of the frame, fit only to be presented to some
senseless stock. We intimate God to be no better than an idol, and to have no more knowledge of us and
insight into us, than an idol can have. If we did believe him to be the living God, we durst not come
before him with services so unsuitable to him, and reproaches of him.
</p>
<p>
     3. It is against the infiniteness of God. We should worship God with those boundless affections which
bear upon them a shadow or image of his infiniteness; such are the desires of the soul which know no
limits, but start out beyond whatsoever enjoyment the heart of man possesses. No creeping creature was to
be offered to God in sacrifice, but such as had legs to run, or wings to fly. For us to come before God with
a light creeping frame, is to worship him with the lowest finite affections, as though anything, though
never so mean or torn, might satisfy an infinite Being; as though a poor shallow creature could give
enough to God without giving him the heart, when, indeed, we cannot give him a worship proportionable
to his infiniteness, did our hearts swell as large as heaven in our desires for him in every act of our duties.
</p>
<p>
     4. It is against the spirituality of God. God being a Spirit, calls for a worship in spirit; to withhold this
from him implies him to be some gross corporeal matter. As a Spirit, he looks for the heart; a wrestling
heart in prayer, a trembling heart in the Word (Isa. 56:2). To bring nothing but the body when we come to
a spiritual God to beg spiritual benefits, to wait for spiritual communications, which can only be
dispensed to us in a spiritual manner, is unsuitable to the spiritual nature of God. A mere carnal service
implicitly denies his spirituality, which requires of us higher engagements than mere corporeal ones.
Worship should be rational, not an imaginative service, wherein is require the activity of our noblest
faculties; and our fancy ought to have no share in it, but in subserviency to the more spiritual part of our
soul.
</p>
<p>
     5. It is against the supremacy of God. As God is one and the only Sovereign; so our hearts should be
one, cleaving wholly to him, and undivided from him. In pretending to deal with him, we acknowledge
his deity and sovereignty; but in withholding our choicest faculties and affections from him, and the
starting of our minds to vain objects, we intimate their equality with God, and their right as well as his to
our hearts and affections. It is as if a princess should commit adultery with some base scullion while she
is before her husband, which would be a plain denial of his sole right to her. It intimates that other things
are superior to God; they are true sovereigns that engross our hearts. If a man were addressing himself to a
prince, and should in an instant turn his back upon him, upon a beck or nod from some inconsiderable
person; is it not an evidence that that person that invited him away hath a greater sovereignty over him
than that prince to whom he was applying himself? And do we not discard God’s absolute dominion over
us, when, at the least beck of a corrupt inclination, we can dispose of our hearts to it, and alienate them
from God? as they, in Ezek. 33:32, left the service of God for the service of their covetousness, which
evidenced that they owned the authority of sin more than the authority of God. This is not to serve God as
our Lord and absolute Master, but to make God serve our turn, and submit his sovereignty to the
supremacy of some unworthy affection. The creature is preferred before the Creator, when the heart runs
most upon it in time of religious worship, and our own carnal interest swallows up the affections that are
due to God. It is “an idol set up in the heart” (Ezek. 14:4) in his solemn presence, and attracts that
devotion to itself which we only owe to our Sovereign Lord; and the more base and contemptible that is to
which the spirit is devoted, the more contempt there is of God’s dominion. Judas’s kiss, with a “Hail
Master!” was no act of worship, or an owning his Master’s authority, but a designing the satisfaction of
his covetousness in the betraying of him.
</p>
<p>
    6. It is against the wisdom of God. God, as a God of order, has put earthly, things in subordination to
heavenly; and we, by this unworthy carriage, invert this order, and put heavenly things in subordination to
earthly; in placing mean and low things in our hearts, and bringing them so placed into God’s presence,
which his wisdom at the creation put under our feet. A service without spiritual affections is a “sacrifice
of fools” (Eccles. 5:1), which have lost their brains and understandings: a foolish spirit is very unsuitable
to an infinitely wise God. Well may God say of such a one, as Achish of David, who seemed mad, “Why
have you brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”
(1 Sam. 21:15.)
</p>
<p>
    7. It is against the omnisciency of God. To carry it fair without, and impertinently within, is as though
God had not an all-seeing eye that could pierce into the heart, and understand every motion of the inward
faculties; as though God were easily cheated with an outward fawning service, like an apothecary’s box
with a gilded title, that may be full of cobwebs within. What is such a carriage, but a design to deceive
God, when, with Herod, we pretend to worship Christ, and intend to murder all the motions of Christ in
our souls A heedless spirit, an estrangement of our souls, a giving the reins to them to run out from the
presence of God to see every reed shaken with the wind, is to deny him to be the Searcher of hearts, and
the Discerner of secret thoughts; as though he could not look through us to the darkness and remoteness
of our minds, but were an ignorant God, who might be put off with the worst as well as the best in our
flock. If we did really believe there were a God of infinite knowledge, who saw our frames and whether
we came dressed with wedding garments suitable to the duties we are about to perform, should we be so
garish, and put him off with such trivial stuff, without any reverence of his Majesty?
</p>
<p>
    8. It is against the holiness of God. To alienate our spirits is to offend him while we pretend to
worship him; though we may be mighty officious in the external part, yet our base and carnal affections
make all our worship but as a heap of dung; and who would not look upon it as an affront to lay dung
before a prince’s throne? (Prov. 21:27), “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;” how much more
when he brings it with a wicked mind? A putrefied carcass under the law had not been so great an affront
to the holiness of God, as a frothy unmelted heart, and a wanton fancy, in a time of worship. God is so
holy, that if we could offer the worship of angels, and the quintessence of our souls in his service, it
would be beneath his infinite purity; how unworthy, then, are they of him, when they are presented not
only without the sense of our uncleanness, but sullied with the fumes and exhalations of our corrupt
affections, which are as so many plague-spots upon our duties, contrary to the unspotted purity of the
Divine nature? Is not this an unworthy conceit of God, and injurious to his infinite holiness?
</p>
<p>
    9. It is against the love and kindness of God. It is a condescension in God to admit a piece of earth to
offer up a duty to him, when he hath myriads of angels to attend him in his court, and celebrate his praise.
To admit man to be an attendant on him, and a partner with angels, is a high favor. It is not a single
mercy, but a heap of mercies, to be admitted into the presence of God (Psalm 5:7): “I will come into thy
house in the multitude of thy mercies.” When the blessed God is so kind as to give us access to his
majesty, do we not undervalue his kindness when we deal uncivilly with him, and deny him the choicest
part of ourselves? It is a contempt of his sovereignty, as our spirits are due to him by nature; a contempt
of his goodness, as our spirits are due to him by gratitude. How abusive a carriage is it to make use of his
mercy to encourage our impudence, that should excite our fear and reverence! How unworthy would it be
for an indigent debtor to bring to his indulgent creditor an empty purse instead of payment! When God
holds out his golden sceptre to encourage our approaches to him, stands ready to give us the pardon of sin
and full felicity, the best things he hath, is it a fit requital of his kindness to give him a formal outside
only, a shadow of religion; to have the heart overswayed with other thoughts and affections, as if all his
proffers were so contemptible as to deserve only a slight at our hands? It is a contempt of the love and
kindness of God.
</p>
<p>
    10. It is against the sufficiency and fulness of God. When we give God our bodies, and the creature
our spirits, it intimates a conceit that there is more content to be had in the creature than in God blessed
forever; that the waters in the cistern are sweeter than those in the fountain. Is not this a practical giving
God the lie, and denying those promises wherein he hath declared the satisfaction he can give to the spirit,
as he is the God of the spirits of all flesh? If we did imagine the excellency and loveliness of God were
worthy to be the ultimate object of our affections, the heart would attend more closely upon him, and be
terminated in him; did we believe God to be all-sufficient, full of grace and goodness, a tender Father, not
willing to forsake his own, willing, as well as able, to supply their wants, the heart would not so lamely
attend yon him, and would not upon every impertinency be diverted from him. There is much of a wrong
notion of God, and a predominancy of the world above him in the heart, when we can more savorly relish
the thoughts of low inferior things than heavenly, and let our spirits upon every trifling occasion be
fugitive from him; it is a testimony that we make not God our chiefest good. If apprehensions of his
excellency did possess our souls, they would be fastened on him, glued to him; we should not listen to
that rabble of foolish thoughts that steal our hearts so often from him. Were our breathings after God as
strong as the pantings of the hart after the water-brooks, we should be like that creature, not diverted in
our course by every puddle. Were God the predominant satisfactory object in our eye, he would carry our
whole soul along with him. When our spirits readily retreat from God in worship upon every giddy
motion, it is a kind of repentance that ever we did come near him, and implies that there is a fuller
satisfaction, and more attractive excellency in that which doth so easily divert us, than in that God to
whose worship we did pretend to address ourselves. It is as if, when we are petitioning a prince, we
should immediately turn about, and make request to one of his guard, as though so mean a person were
more able to give us the boon we want than the sovereign is.
</p>
<p>
    II. Consideration by way of motive. To have our spirits off from God in worship is a bad sign: it was
not so in innocence. The heart of Adam could cleave to God: the law of God was engraven upon him, he
could apply himself to the fulfilling of it without any twinkling. There was no folly and vanity in his
mind, no independency in his thoughts, no duty was his burden; for there was in him a proneness to, and a
delight in, all the duties of worship. It is the fall hath distempered us; and the more unwieldiness there is
in our sphits, the more carnal our affections are in worship, the more evidence there is of the strength of
that revolted state.
</p>
<p>
     1. It argues much corruption in the heart. As by the eructations of the stomach, we may judge of the
windiness and foulness of it; so, by the inordinate motions of our minds and hearts, we may judge of the
weakness of its complexion. A strength of sin is evidenced by the eruptions and ebullitions of it in
worship, when they are more sudden, numerous, and vigorous than the motions of grace. When the heart
is apt, like tinder, to catch fire from Satan, it is a sign of much combustible matter suitable to his
temptation. Were not corruption strong, the soul could ’not turn so easily from God when it is in his
presence, and hath an advantageous opportunity to create a fear and awe of God in it. Such base fruit
could not sprout up so suddenly, were there not much sap and juice in the root of sin. What communion
with a living root can be evidenced without exercises of an inward life? That spirit, which is a well of
living waters in a gracious heart, will be especially springing up when it is before God.
</p>
<p>
     2. It shows much affection to earthly things, and little to heavenly. There must needs be an inordinate
affection to earthly things, when, upon every slight solicitation, we can part with God, and turn the back
upon a service glorious for him and advantageous for ourselves, to wed our hearts to some idle fancy that
signifies nothing. How can we be said to entertain God in our affections, when we give him not the
precedency in our understandings, but let every trifle jostle the sense of God out of our minds? Were our
hearts fully determined to spiritual things, such vanities could not seat themselves in our understandings,
and divide our spirits from God. Were our hearts balanced with a love to God, the world could never steal
our hearts so much from his worship, but his worship would draw our hearts to it. It shows abase
neutrality in the greatest concernments; a halting between God and Baal; a contrariety between affection
and conscience, when natural conscience presses a man to duties of worship, and his other affections pull
him back, draw him to carnal objects, and make him slight that whereby he may honor God. God argues
the profaneness of the Jews’ hearts from the wickedness they brought into his house, and acted there (Jer.
23:11): “Yea, in my house,” that is, my worship, “I found their wickedness,” saith the Lord. Carnality in
worship is a kind of an idolatrous frame; when the heart is renewed, idols are cast to the moles and the
bats (Isa. 2:20).
</p>
<p>
     3. It shows much hypocrisy to have our spirits off from God. The mouth speaks, and the carriage
pretends what the heart doth not think; there is a dissent of the heart from the pretence of the body.
Instability is a sure sign of hypocrisy. Double thoughts argue a double heart. The wicked are compared to
chaff (Psalm 1:4), for the uncertain and various motions of their minds, by the least wind of fancy. The
least motion of a carnal object diverts the spirit from God, as the scent of carrion doth the raven from the
fight it was set upon. The people of God are called God’s spouse, and God calls himself their husband;
whereby is noted the most intimate union of the soul with God; and that there ought to be the highest love
and affection to him, and faithfulness in his worship; but when the heart doth start from him in worship, it
is a sign of the unsteadfastness of it with God, and a disrelish of any communion with him; it is, as God
complains of the Israelites, a going a whoring after our own imaginations. As grace respects God as the
object of worship, so it looks most upon God in approaching to him. Where there is a likeness and love,
there is a desire of converse and intimacy; if there be no spiritual entwining about God in our worship, it
is a sign there is no likeness to him, no true sense of him, no renewed image of God in us; every living
image will move strongly to join itself with its original copy, and be glad, with Jacob, to sit steadily in
those chariots that shall convey him to his beloved Joseph.
</p>
<p>
     III. Consider the danger of a carnal worship.
</p>
<p>
     1. We lose the comfort of worship. The soul is a great gainer when it offers a spiritual worship, and as
great a loser when it is unfaithful with God. Treachery and perfidiousness hinder commerce among men;
so doth hypocrisy in its own nature communion with God. God never promised anything to the carcass,
but to the spirit of worship. God hath no obligation upon him, by any word of his, to reward us with
himself, when we perform it not to himself; when we give an outside worship, we have only the outside of
an ordinance; we can expect no kernel, when we give God only the shell: he that only licks the outside of
the glass, can never be refreshed with the rich cordial enclosed within. A cold and lazy formality will
make God to withdraw the light of his countenance, and not shine with any delightful communications
upon our souls; but if we come before him with a liveliness of affections, and steadiness of heart, he will
draw the veil, and cause his glory to display itself before us. An humble praying Christian, and a warm,
affectionate Christian in worship, will soon find a God who is delighted with such frames, and cannot
long withhold himself from the soul. When our hearts are inflamed with love to him in worship, it is a
preparation to some act of love on his part, whereby he intends further to gratify us. When John was in the
Spirit on the Lord’s day, that is, in spiritual employment, and meditation, and other duties, he had that
great revelation of what should happen to the church in all ages (Rev. 1:10); his being in the Spirit,
intimates his ordinary course on that day, and not any extraordinary act in him, though it was followed
with an extraordinary discovery of God to him; when he was thus engaged, “he heard a voice behind
him.” God doth not require of us spirituality in worship to advantage himself, but that we might be
prepared to be advantaged by him. If we have a clear and well-disposed eye, it is not a benefit to the sun,
but fits us to receive benefits from his beams. Worship is an act that perfects our own souls; they are then
most widened by spiritual frames, to receive the influence of divine blessings, as an eye most opened
receives the fruit of the sun’s light better than the eye that is shut. The communications of God are more
or less, according as our spiritual frames are more or less in our worship; God will not give his blessings
to unsuitable hearts. What a nasty vessel is a carnal heart for a spiritual communication! The chief end of
every duty enjoined by God, is to have communion with him; and therefore it is called a drawing near to
God; it is impossible, therefore, that the outward part of any duty can answer the end of God in his
institution. It is not a bodily appearance or gesture whereby men can have communion with God, but by
the impressions of the heart upon God; without this, all the rich streams of grace will run beside us, and
the growth of the soul be hindered and impaired. A “diligent hand makes rich,” saith the wise man; a
diligent heart in spiritual worship, brings in rich incomes to the humble and spiritual soul.
</p>
<p>
    2. It renders the worship not only unacceptable, but abominable to God. It makes our gold to become
dross, it soils our duties, and bespots our souls. A carnal and unsteady frame shows an indifferency of
spirit at best; and lukewarmness is as ungrateful to God, as heavy and nauseous meat is to the stomach; he
“spews them out of his mouth” (Rev. 3:16). As our gracious God Both overlook infirmities where
intentions are good, and endeavors serious and strong; so he loathes the services where the frames are
stark naught (Psalm 66:118): “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.”
Lukewarm and indifferent services stink in the nostrils of God. The heart seems to loathe God when it
starts from him upon every occasion, when it is unwilling to employ itself about, and stick close to him:
and can God be pleased with such a frame? The more of the heart and spirit is in any service, the more
real goodness there is in it, and the more savory it is to God; the less of the heart and spirit, the less of
goodness, and the more nauseous to God, who loves righteousness and “truth in the inward parts” (Psalm
51:6). And therefore infinite goodness and holiness cannot but hate worship presented to him with
deceitful, carnal, and flitting affections; they must be more nauseous to God, than a putrefied carcass can
be to man; they are the profanings of that which should be the habitation of the Spirit; they make the
spirit, the seat of duty, a filthy dunghill; and are as loathsome to God, as money-changers in the temple
were to our Saviour. We see the evil of carnal frames, and the necessity and benefit of spiritual frames:
for further help in this last, let us practise these following directions:
</p>
<p>
    1. Keep up spiritual frames out of worship. To avoid low affections, we must keep our hearts as much
as we can in a settled elevation. If we admit unworthy dispositions at one time, we shall not easily be rid
of them in another;528 as he that would not be bitten with gnats in the night, must keep his windows shut
in the day: when they are once entered, it is not easy to expel them; in which respect, one adviseth to be
such out of worship as we would be in worship. If we mix spiritual affections with our worldly
employments, worldly affections will not mingle themselves so easily with our heavenly engagements. If
our hearts be spiritual in our outward calling, they will scarce be carnal in our religious service. If “we
walk in the Spirit, we shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh” (Gal. 5:16). A spiritual walk in the day will
hinder carnal lustings in worship. The fire was to be kept alive upon the altar, when sacrifices were not
offered, from morning till night, from night till morning, as well as in the very time of sacrifice. A
spiritual life and vigor out of worship would render it at its season sweet and easy, and preserve a
spontaneity and preparedness to it, and make it both natural and pleasant to us. Anything that doth
unhinge and discompose our spirits, is inconsistent with religious services, which are to be performed
with the greatest sedateness and gravity. All irregular passions disturb the serenity of the spirit, and open
the door for Satan: saith the apostle (Eph. 4:26, 27), “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; neither
give place to the devil.” Where wrath breaks the lock, the devil will quickly be over the threshold; and
though they be allayed, yet they leave the heart sometime after, like the sea rolling and swelling after the
storm is ceased. Mixture with ill company leaves a tincture upon us in worship. Ephraim’s allying himself
with the Gentiles, bred an indifferency in religion (Hos. 7:8): “Ephraim hath mixed himself with the
people; Ephraim is a cake not turned:” it will make our hearts, and consequently our services, half dough,
as well as half baked; these and the like, make the Holy Spirit withdraw himself, and then the soul is like
a windbound vessel, and can make no way. When the sun departs from us, it carries its beams away with
it; then “doth darkness spread itself over the earth, and the beasts of the forests creep out” (Psalm 104:20).
When the Spirit withdraws awhile frorn a good man, it carries away (though not habitual, yet) much of the
exciting and assisting grace; and then carnal dispositions perk up themselves from the bosom of natural
corruption. To be spiritual in worship, we must bar the door at other times against that which is contrary
to it; as he that would not be infected with a contagious disease, carries some preservative about with him,
and inures himself to good scents. To this end, be much in secret ejaculations to God; these are the purest
flights of the soul, that have more of fervor and less of carnality; they preserve a liveliness in the spirit,
and make it more fit to perform solemn stated worship with greater freedom and activity; a constant use of
this would make our whole lives, lives of worship. As frequent sinful acts strengthen habits of sin, so
frequent religious acts strengthen habits of grace.
</p>
<p>
     2. Excite and exercise particularly a love to God, and dependence on him. Love is a commanding
affection, a uniting grace; it draws all the faculties of the soul to one centre. The soul that loves God,
when it hath to do with him, is bound to the beloved object; it can mind nothing else during such
impressions. When the affection is set to the worship of God, everything the soul hath will be bestowed
upon it; as David’s disposition was to the temple (1 Chron. 29:3). Carnal frames, like the fowls, will be
lighting upon the sacrifice, but not when it is inflamed; though the scent of the flesh invite them, yet the
heat of the fire drives them to their distance. A flaming love will singe the flies that endeavor to interrupt
and disturb us. The happiness of heaven consists in a full attraction of the soul to God, by his glorious
influence upon it; there will be such a diffusion of his goodness throughout the souls of the blessed, as
will unite the affections perfectly to him; these affections which are scattered here, will be there gathered
into one flame, moving to him, and centering in him: therefore, the more of a heavenly frame possesses
our affections here, the more settled and uniform will our hearts be in all their motions to God, and
operations about him. Excite a dependence on him: (Prov. 16:3) “Commit thy works to the Lord, and thy
thoughts shall be established.” Let us go out in God’s strength, and not in our own; vain is the help of man
in anything, and vain is the help of the heart. It is through God only we can do valiantly in spiritual
concerns as well as temporal; the want of this makes but slight impressions upon the spirit.
</p>
<p>
     3. Nourish right conceptions of the majesty of God in your minds. Let us consider that we are drawing
to God, the most amiable object, the best of beings, wcrthy of infinite honor, and highly meriting the
highest affections we can give; a God that made the world by a word, that upholds the great frame of
heaven and earth; a Majesty above the conceptions of angels; who uses not his power to strike us to our
deserved punishment, but his love and bounty to allure us; a God that gave all the creatures to serve us,
and can, in a trice, make them as much our enemies as he hath now made them our servants. Let us view
him in his greatness, and in his goodness, that our hearts may have a true value of the worship of so great
a majesty, and count it the most worthy employment with all diligence to attend upon him. When we have
a fear of God, it will make our worship serious; when we have a joy in God, it will make our worship
durable. Our affections will be raised when we represent God in the most reverential, endearing, and
obliging circumstances. We honor the majesty of God, when we consider him with due reverence
according to the greatness and perfection of his works, and in this reverence of his majesty doth worship
chiefly consist. Low thoughts of God will make low frames in us before him. If we thought God an
infinite glorious Spirit, how would our hearts be lower than our knees in his presence! How humbly, how
believingly pleading is the Psalmist, when he considers God to be without comparison in the heavens; to
whom none of the sons of the mighty can be likened; when there was none like to him in strength and
faithfulness round about (Psalm 89:8–8). We should have also deep impressions of the omniscience of
God, and remember we have to deal with a God that searcheth the heart and trieth the reins, to whom the
most secret temper is as visible as the loudest words are audible; that though man judges by outward
expressions, God judges by inward affections. As the law of God regulates the inward frames of the heart,
so the eye of God pitches upon the inward intentions of the soul. If God were visibly present with us,
should we not approach to him with strong affections, summon our spirits to attend upon him, behave
ourselves modestly before him? Let us consider he is as really present with us, as if he were visible to us;
let us, therefore, preserve a strong sense of the presence of God. No man, but one out of his wits, when he
were in the presence of a prince, and making a speech to him, would break off at every period, and run
after the catching of butterflies. Remember in all worship you are before the Lord, to whom all things are
open and naked.
</p>
<p>
    4. Let us take heed of inordinate desires after the world. As the world steals away a man’s heart from
the word, so it doth from all other worship; “It chokes the word” (Matt. 13:27); it stifles all the spiritual
breathings after God in every duty; the edge of the soul is bunted by it, and made too dull for such
sublime exercises. The apostle’s rule in prayer, when he joins “sobriety with watching unto prayer” (1
Pet. 4:7), is of concern in all worship, sobriety in the pursuit and use of all worldly things. A man drunk
with worldly fumes cannot watch, cannot be heavenly, affectionate, spiritual in service. There is a
magnetic force in the earth to hinder our flights to heaven. Birds, when they take their first flights from
the earth, have more flutterings of their wings, than when they are mounted further in the air, and got
more without the sphere of the earth’s attractiveness: the motion of their wings is more steady, that you
can erceive them stir; they move like a ship with a full gale. The word is a clog upon the soul, and a bar to
spiritual frames; it is as hard to elevate the heart to God in the midst of a hurry of worldly affairs, as it is
difficult to meditate when we are near a great noise of waters falling from a precipice, or in the midst of a
volley of muskets. Thick clayey affections bemire the heart, and make it unfit for such high flights it is to
take in worship; therefore, get your hearts clear from worldly thoughts and desires, if you would be more
spiritual in worship.
</p>
<p>
    5. Let us be deeply sensible of our present wants, and the supplies we may meet with in worship. Cold
affections to the things we would have will grow cooler; weakness of desire for the communications in
worship, will freeze our hearts at the time of worship, and make way for vain and foolish diversions. A
beggar that is ready to perish, and knows he is next door to ruin, will not slightly and dully beg an alms,
and will not be diverted from his importunity by every slight call, or the moving of an atom in the air. Is it
pardon we would have? let us apprehend the blackness of sin, with the aggravations of it as it respects
God; let us be deeply sensible of the want of pardon and worth of mercy, and get your affctions into such
a frame as a condemned man would do; let us consider, that as we are now at the throne of God’s grace,
we shall shortly be at the bar of God’s justice; and if the soul should be forlorn there, how fixedly and
earnestly would it plead for mercy! Let us endeavor to stir up the same affections now, which we have
seen some dying men have, and which we suppose despairing souls would have done at God’s tribunal.
We must be sensible that the life or death of our souls depends upon worship.529 Would we not be
ashamed to be ridiculous in our carriage while we are eating; and shall we not be ashamed to be cold or
garish before God, when the salvation of our souls, as well as the honor of God, is concerned? If we did
see the heaps of sins, the eternity of punishment due to them; if we did see an angry and offended Judge;
if we did see the riches of merey, the glorious outgoings of God in the sanctuary, the blessed doles he
gives out to men when they spiritually attend upon him, both the one and the other would make us
perform our duties humbly, sincerely, earnestly, and affectionately, and wait upon him with our whole
souls, to have misery averted, and mercy bestowed. Let our sense of this be encouraged by the
consideration of our Saviour presenting his merits; with what affection doth he present his merits, his
blood shed upon the cross, now in heaven? And shall our hearts be cold and frozen, flitting and unsteady,
when his affections are so much concerned? Christ doth not present any man’s case and duties without a
sense of his wants; and shall we have none of our own? Let me add this; let us affect our hearts with a
sense of what supplies we have met with in former worship; the delightful remembrance of what converse
we have had with God in former worship would spiritualize our hearts for the present worship. Had Peter
had a view of Christ’s glory in the mount fresh in his thoughts, he would not so easily have turned his
back upon his Master, nor would the Israelites have been at leisure for their idolatry, had they preserved
the sense of the majesty of God discovered in his late thunders from Mount Sinai.
</p>
<p>
     6. If anything intrudes that may choke the worship, cast it speedily out. We cannot hinder Satan and
our own corruption from presenting coolers to us, but we may hinder the success of them; we cannot
hinder the gnats from buzzing about us when we are in our business, but we may prevent them from
settling upon us. A man that is running on a considerable errand, will shun all unnecessary discourse, that
may make him forget or loiter in his business. What though there may be something offered that is good
in itself, yet if it hath a tendency to despoil God of his honor, and ourselves of the spiritual intentness in
worship, send it away. Those that weed a field of corn, examine not the nature and particular virtues of the
weeds, but consider only how they choke the corn, to which the native juice of the soil is designed.
Consider what you are about; and if anything interpose that may divert you, or cool your affections in
your present worship, cast it out.
</p>
<p>
     7. As to private worship, let us lay hold of the most melting opportunities and frames. When we find
our hearts in a more than ordinary spiritual frame, let us look upon it as a call from God to attend him;
such impressions and notions are God’s voice, inviting us into communion with him in some particular
act of worship, and promising us some success in it. When the Psalmist had a secret motion to “seek
God’s face” (Psalm 27:8), and complied with it, the issue is the encouragement of his heart, which breaks
out into an exhortation to others to be of good courage, and wait on the Lord (v. 13, 14): “Wait on the
Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.” One blow will do
more on the iron when it is hot, than a hundred when it is cold; melted metals may be stamped with any
impression; but, once hardened, will with difficulty be brought into the figure we intend.530
</p>
<p>
     8. Let us examine ourselves at the end of every act of worship, and chide ourselves for any carnality
we perceive in them. Let us take a review of them, and examine the reason, why art thou so low and
carnal, O my soul? as David did of his disquietedness (Psalm 42:6): “Why art thou cast down, O my soul,
and why art thou disquieted within me?” If any unworthy frames have surprised us in worship, let us seek
them out after worship; call them to the bar; make an exact scrutiny into the causes of them, that we may
prevent their incursions another time; let our pulses beat quick by way of anger and indignation against
them; this would be a repairing what hath been amiss; otherwise they may grow, and clog an afterworship
more than they did a former. Daily examination is an antidote against the temptations of the following
day, and constant examination of ourselves after duty is a preservative against vain encroachments in
following duties; and upon the finding them out, let us apply the blood of Christ by faith for our cure, and
draw strength from the death of Christ for the conquest of them, and let us also be humbled for them. God
lifts ap the humble; when we are humbled for our carnal frames in one duty, we shall find ourselves by
the grace of God more elevated in the next.

<div class="chapter">
<h1 class="caption">DISCOURSE V - ON THE ETERNITY OF GOD</h1>
<blockquote>
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
<div class="sig">PSALM 90:2</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
    THE title of this pcalm is a prayer; the author, Moses. Some think not only this, but the ten following
psalms, were composed by him. The title wherewith he is dignified is, “The man of God,” as also in Deut.
33:1. One inspired by him to be his interpreter, and deliver his oracles; one particularly directed by
him;531 one who as a servant did diligently employ himself in his master’s business, and acted for the
glory of God;532 he was the minister of the Old Testament, and the prophet of the New.533
</p>
<p>
    There are two parts of this psalm. 1. A complaint of the frailty of man’s life in general (v. 3–6); and
then a particular complaint of the condition of the church (v. 8–10). 2. A prayer (v. 12). But before he
speaks of the shortness of human life, he fortifies them by the consideration of the refuge they had, and
should find in God (v. 1). “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. We have had no
settled abode in the earth, since the time of Abraham’s being called out from Ur of the Chaldees. We have
had Canaan in a promise, we have it not yet in possession; we have been exposed to the cruelties of an
oppressing enemy, and the incommodities of a desert wilderness; we have wanted the fruits of the earth,
but not the dews of heaven. Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. Abraham was under thy
conduct; Isaac and Jacob under thy care; their posterrty was multiplied by thee, and that under their
oppressions. Thou hast been our shield against dangers, our security in the times of trouble; when we
were pursued to the Red Sea, it was not a creature delivered us; and when we feared the pinching of our
bowels in the desert, it was no creature rained manna upon us. Thou hast been our dwelling-place; thou
hast kept open house for us, sheltered us against storms, and preserved us from mischief, as a house doth
an inhabitant from wind and weather; and that not in one or two, but in all generations. Some think an
allusion is here made to the ark, to which they were to have recourse in all emergencies. Our refuge and
defence hath not been from created things; not from the ark, but from the God of the ark.” Observe,
</p>
<p>
    1. God is a perpetual refuge and security to his people. His providence is not confined to one
generation; it is not one age only that tastes of his bounty and compassion. His eye never yet slept, nor
hath he suffered the little ship of his church to be swallowed up, though it hath been tossed apon the
waves; he hath always been a haven to preserve us, a house to secure us; he hath always had compassions
to piity us, and power to protect us; he hath had a face to shine, when the world hath had an angry
countenance to frown.534 He brought Enoch home by an extraordinary translation from a brutish world;
and when he was resolved to reckon with men for their brutish lives, he lodged Noah, the phoenix of the
world, in an ark, and kept him alive as a spark in the midst of many waters, whereby to rekindle a church
in the world; in all generations he is a dwelling-place to secure his people here, or entertain them above.
His providence is not wearied, nor his care fainting; he never wanted will to relieve us, “for he hath been
our refuge,” nor ever can want power to support us, “for he is a God from everlasting to everlasting.” The
church never wanted a pilot to steer her, and a rock to shelter her, and dash in pieces the waves which
threaten her.
</p>
<p>
    2. How worthy is it to remember former benefits, when we come to beg for new. Never were the
records of God’s mercies so exactly revised, as when his people have stood in need of new editions of his
power. How necessary are our wants to stir us up to pay the rent of thankfulness in arrear! He renders
himself doubly unworthy of the mercies he wants, that doth not gratefully acknowledge the mercies he
hath received. God scarce promised any deliverance to the Israelites, and they, in their distress, scarce
prayed for any deliverance; but that from Egypt was mentioned on both sides, by God to encourage them,
and by them to acknowledge their confidence in him. The greater our dangers, the more we should call to
mind God’s former kindness. We are not only thankfully to acknowledge the mercies bestowed upon our
persons, or in our age, but those of former times. “Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.”
Moses was not living in the former generations, yet he appropriates the former mercies to the present age.
Mercies, as well as generations, proceed out of the loins of those that have gone before. All mankind are
but one Adam; the whole church but one body. In the second verse he backs his former consideration. 1.
By the greatness of his power in forming the world. 2. By the boundlessness of his duration: “From
everlasting to everlasting.” As thou hast been our dwelling-place, and expended upon us the strength of
thy power and riches of thy love, so we have no reason to doubt the continuance on thy part, if we be not
wanting on our parts; for the vast mountains and fruitful earth are the works of thy hands, and there is less
power requisite for our relief, than there was for their creation; and though so much strength hath been
upon various occasions manifested, yet thy arm is not weakened, for “from everlasting to everlasting thou
art God.”535 Thou hast always been God, and no time can be assigned as the beginning of thy being.536
The mountains are not of so long a standing as thyself; they are the effects of thy power, and therefore
cannot be equal to thy duration; since they are the effects, they suppose the precedency of their cause. If
we would look back, we can reach no further than the beginning of the creation, and account the years
from the first foundation of the world; but after that we must lose ourselves in the abyss of eternity; we
have no cue to guide our thoughts; we can see no bounds in thy eternity. But as for man, he traverseth the
world a few days, and by thy order pronounced concerning all men, returns to the dust, and moulders into
the grave. By mountains, some understand angels, as being creatures of a more elevated nature; by earth,
they understand human nature, the earth being the habitation of men. There is no need to divert in this
place from the letter to such a sense. The description seems to be poetical, and amounts to this: he neither
began with the beginning of time, nor will expire with the end of it; he did not begin when he made
himself known to our fathers, but his being did precede the creation of the world, before any created being
was formed, and any time settled.537 “Before the mountains were brought forth,” or before they were
begotten or born; the word being used in those senses in Scripture; before they stood up higher than the
rest of the earthly mass God had created. It seems that mountains were not casually cast up by the force of
the deluge softening the ground, and driving several parcels of it together, to grow up into a massy body,
as the sea doth the sand in several places; but they were at first formed by God. The eternity of God is
here described,
</p>
<p>
     1. In his priority: “Before the world.”
</p>
<p>
     2. In the extension of his duration: “From everlasting to everlasting thou art God.” He was before the
world, yet he neither began nor ends; he is not a temporary, but an eternal God; it takes in both parts of
eternity, what was before the creation of the world, and what is after; though the eternity of God be one
permanent state, without succession, yet the spirit of God, suiting himself to the weakness of our
conception, divides it into two parts; one past before the foundation of the world, another to come after
the destruction of the world; as he did exist before all ages, and as he will exist after all ages. Many truths
lie couched in the verse.
</p>
<p>
     1. The world hath a beginning of being: it was not from eternity, it was once nothing; had it been of a
very long duration, some records would have remained of some memorable actions done of a longer date
than any extant. 2. The world owes its being to the creating power of God: “Thou hast formed it” out of
nothing into being; Thou, that is, God; it could not spring into being of itself; it was nothing; it must have
a former. 3. God was in being before the world: the cause must be before the effect; that word which gives
being, must be before that which receives being. 4. This Being was from eternity: “From everlasting.” 5.
This Being shall endure to eternity: “To everlasting.” 6. There is but one God, one eternal: “From
everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” None else but one hath the property of eternity; the gods of the
heathen cannot lay claim to it.
</p>
<p>
     Doct. God is of an eternal duration. The eternity of God is the foundation of the stability of the
covenant, the great comfort of a Christian. The design of God in Scripture is, to set forth his dealing with
men in the way of a covenant. The priority of God before all things begins the Bible: “In the beginning
God created” (Gen. 1:1). His covenant can have no foundation, but in his duration before and after the
world:538 and Moses here mentions his eternity, not only with respect to the essence of God, but to his
federal providence; as he is the dwelling-place of his people in all generations. The duration of God
forever is more spoken of in Scripture than his eternity, à parte ante, though that is the foundation of all
the comfort we can take from his immortality: if he had a beginning, he might have an end, and so all our
happiness, hope and being would expire with him; but the Scripture sometimes takes notice of his being
without beginning, as well as without end: “Thou art from everlasting” (Psalm 93:2); “Blessed be God
from everlasting to everlasting” (Psalm 41:13); “I was set up from everlasting” (Prov. 8:23): if his
wisdom were from everlasting, himself was from everlasting: whether we understand it of Christ the Son
of God, or of the essential wisdom of God, it is all one to the present purpose. The wisdom of God
supposeth the essence of God, as habits in creatures suppose the being of some power or faculty as their
subject. The wisdom of God supposeth mind and understanding, essence and substance. The notion of
eternity is difficult; as Austin said of time,539 if no man will ask me the question, what time is, I know
well enough what it is; but if any ask me what it is, I know not how to explain it; so may I say of eternity;
it is easy in the word pronounced, but hardly understood, and more hardly expressed; it is better expressed
by negative than positive words. Though we cannot comprehend eternity, yet we may comprehend that
there is an eternity; as, though we cannot comprehend the essence of God what he is, yet we may
comprehend that he is; we may understand the notion of his existence, though we cannot understand the
infiniteness of his nature; yet we may better understand eternity than infiniteness; we can better conceive
a time with the addition of numberless days and years, than imagine a Being without bounds; whence the
apostle joins his eternity with his power; “His eternal power and Godhead” (Rom. 1:20); because, next to
the power of God, apprehended in the creature, we come necessarily by reasoning, to acknowledge the
eternity of God. He that hath an incomprehensible power must needs have an eternity of nature; his power
is most sensible in the creatures to the eye of man, and his eternity easily from thence deducible by the
reason of man. Eternity is a perpetual duration, which hath neither beginning nor end; time hath both.
Those things we say are in time that have beginning, grow up by degrees, have succession of parts;
eternity is contrary to time, and is therefore a permanent and immutable state; a perfect possession of life
without any variation; it comprehends in itself all years, all ages, all periods of ages; it never begins; it
endures after every, duration of time, and never ceaseth; it doth as much outrun time, as it went before the
beginning of it: time supposeth something before it; but there can be nothing before eternity; it were not
then eternity. Time hath a continual succession; the former time passeth away and another succeeds: the
last year is not this year, nor this year the next. We must conceive of eternity contrary to the notion of
time; as the nature of time consists in the succession of parts, so the nature of eternity in an infinite
immutable duration. Eternity and time differ as the sea and rivers; the sea never changes place, and is
always one water; but the rivers glide along, and are swallowed up in the sea; so is time by eternity.540 A
thing is said to be eternal, or everlasting rather, in Scripture,
</p>

     1. When it is of a long duration, though it will have an end; when it hath no measures of time
determined to it; so circumcision is said to be in the flesh for an “everlasting covenant” (Gen. 17:13); not
purely everlasting, but so long as that administration of the covenant should endure. And so when a
servant would not leave his master, but would have his ear bored, it is said, he should be a servant
“forever” (Deut. 15:17); i. e. till the jubilee, which was every fiftieth year: so the meat-offering they were
to offer is said to be “perpetual” (Lev. 6:20); Canaan is said to be given to Abraham for an “everlasting”
possession (Gen. 17:8); when as the Jews are expelled from Canaan, which is given a prey to the
barbarous nations. Indeed circumcision was not everlasting; yet the substance of the covenant whereof
this was a sign, viz. that God would be the God of believers, endures forever; and that circumcision of the
heart, which was signified by circumcision of the flesh, shall remain forever in the kingdom of glory: it
was not so much the lasting of the sign, as of the thing signified by it, and the covenant sealed by it: the
sign had its abolition; so that the apostle is so peremptory in it, that he asserts, that if any went about to
establish it, he excluded himself from a participation of Christ (Gal. 5:2). The sacrifices were to be
perpetual, in regard to the thing signified by them; viz. the death of Christ, which was to endure in the
efficacy of it and the passover was to be “forever” (Exod. 12:24), in regard of the redemption signified by
it, which was to be of everlasting remembrance. Canaan was to be an everlasting possession, in regard of
the glory of heaven typified, to be forever conferred upon the spiritual seed of Abraham.

     2. When a thing hath no end, though it hath a beginning. So angels and souls are everlasting; though
their being shall never cease, yet there was a time when their being began; they were nothing before they
were something, though they shall never be nothing again, but shall live in endless happiness or misery.
But that properly is eternal that hath neither beginning nor end; and thus eternity is a property of God.
</p>
<p>
     In this doctrine I shall show, I. How God is eternal, or in what respects eternity is his property. II. That
he is eternal, and must needs be so. III. That eternity is only proper to God, and not common to him with
any creature. IV. The use.
</p>
<p>
     I. How God is eternal, or in what respects he is so. Eternity is a negative attribute, and is a denying of
God any measures of time, as immensity is a denying of him any bounds of place. As immensity is the
diffusion of his essence, so eternity is the duration of his essence; and when we say God is eternal, we
exclude from him all possibility of beginning and ending, all flux and change. As the essence of God
cannot be bounded by any place, so it is not to be limited by any time: as it is his immensity to be
everywhere, so it is his eternity to be alway. As created things are said to be somewhere in regard of
place, and to be present, past, or future, in regard of time; so the Creator in regard of place is everywhere,
in regard of time is semper.541 His duration is as endless as his essence is boundless: he always was and
always will be, and will no more have an end than he had a beginning; and this is an excellency belonging
to the Supreme Being.542 As his essence comprehends all beings, and exceeds them, and his immensity
surmounts all places; so his eternity comprehends all times, all durations, and infinitely excels them.543
</p>
<p>
     1. God is without beginning. “In the beginning” God created the world (Gen. 1:1). God was then
before the beginning of it; and what point can be set wherein God began, if he were before the beginning
of created things? God was without beginning, though all other things had time and beginning from him.
As unity is before all numbers, so is God before all his creatures. Abraham called upon the name of the
everlasting God (Gen. 21:33) the eternal God.544—It is opposed to the heathen gods, which were but of
yesterday, new coined, and so new; but the eternal God was before the world was made. In that sense it is
to be understood; “The mystery which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest,
and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the everlasting God, made known to
all nations for the obedience of faith” (Rom. 16:26). The gospel is not preached by the command of a new
and temporary god, but of that God that was before all ages: though the manifestation of it be in time, yet
the purpose and resolve of it was from eternity. If there were decrees before the foundation of the world,
there was a Decreer before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world he loved
Christ as a Mediator; a fore-ordination of him was before the foundation of the world (John 17:24); a
choice of men, and therefore a Chooser before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4); a grace given in
Christ before the world began (2 Tim. 1:9), and therefore a Donor of that grace. From those places, saith
Crellius, it appears that God was before the foundation of the world, but they do not assert an absolute
eternity; but to be before all creatures is equivalent to his being from eternity.545 Time began with the
foundation of the world; but God being before time, could have no beginning in time. Before the
beginning of the creation, and the beginning of time, there could be nothing but eternity; nothing but what
was uncreated, that is, nothing but what was without beginning. To be in time is to have a beginning; to
be before all time is never to have a beginning, but always to be; for as between the Creator and creatures
there is no medium, so between time and eternity there is no medium. It is as easily deduced that he that
was before all creatures is eternal, as he that made all creatures is God. If he had a beginning, he must
have it from another, or from himself; if from another, that from whom he received his being would be
better than he, so more a God than he. He cannot be God that is not supreme; he cannot be supreme that
owes his being to the power of another. He would not be said only to have immortality as he is (1 Tim.
6:16), if he had it dependent upon another; nor could he have a beginning from himself; if he had given
beginning to himself, then he was once nothing; there was a time when he was not; if he was not, how
could he be the Cause of himself? It is impossible for any to give a beginning and being to itself: if it acts
it must exist, and so exist before it existed. A thing would exist as a cause before it existed as an effect.
He that is not, cannot be the cause that he is; if, therefore, God doth exist, and hath not his being from
another, he must exist from eternity. Therefore, when we say God is of and from himself, we mean not
that God gave being to himself; but it is negatively to be understood that he hath no cause of existence
without himself. Whatsoever number of millions of millions of years we can imagine before the creation
of the world, yet God was infinitely before those; he is therefore called the“Ancient of Days” (Dan. 7:9),
as being before all days and time, and eminently containing in himself all times and ages. Though, indeed,
God cannot properly be called ancient, that will testify that he is decaying, and shortly will not be; no
more than he can be called young, which would signify that he was not long before. All created things are
new and fresh; but no creature can find out any beginning of God: it is impossible there should be any
beginning of him.
</p>
<p>
     2. God is without end. He always was, always is, and always will be what he is. He remains always
the same in being; so far from any change, that no shadow of it can touch him (James 1:17). He will
continue in being as long as he hath already enjoyed it; and if we could add never so many millions of
years together, we are still as far from an end as from a beginning; for “the Lord shall endure forever”
(Psalm 9:7). As it is impossible he should not be, being from all eternity, so it is impossible that he should
not be to all eternity. The Scripture is most plentiful in testimonies of this eternity of God, à parte post, or
after the creation of the world: he is said to “live forever” (Rev. 4:9, 10). The earth shall perish, but God
shall “endure forever,” and his “years shall have no end” (Psalm 102:27). Plants and animals grow up
from small beginnings, arrive to their full growth, and decline again, and have always remarkable
alterations in their nature; but there is no declination in God by all the revolutions of time. Hence some
think the incorruptibility of the Deity was signified by the shittim, or cedar wood, whereof the ark was
made, it being of an incorruptible nature (Ex. 25:10). That which had no beginning of duration can never
have an end, or any interruptions in it. Since God never depended apon any, what should make him cease
to be what eternally he hath been, or put a stop to the continuance of his perfections? He cannot will his
own destruction; that is against universal nature in all things to cease from being, if they can preserve
themselves. He cannot desert his own being, because he cannot but love himself as the best and chiefest
good. The reason that anything decays is either its own native weakness, or a superior power of something
contrary to it. There is no weakness in the nature of God that can introduce any corruption, because he is
infinitely simple without any mixture; nor can he be overpowered by anything else; a weaker cannot hurt
him, and a stronger than he there cannot be; nor can he be outwitted or circumvented, because of his
infinite wisdom.546 As he received his being from none, so he cannot be deprived of it by any: as he doth
necessarily exist, so he doth necessarily always exist. This, indeed, is the property of God; nothing so
proper to him as always to be. Whatsoever perfections any being hath, if it be not eternal, it is not divine.
God only is immortal;547 he only is so by a necessity of nature. Angels, souls, and bodies too, after the
resurrection, shall be immortal, not by nature, but grant; they are subject to return to nothing, if that word
that raised them from nothing should speak them into nothing again. It is as easy with God to strip them
of it, as to invest them with it; nay, it is impossible but that they should perish, if God should withdraw his
power from preserving them, which he exerted in creating them; but God is immovably fixed in his own
being; that as none gave him his life, so none can deprive him of his life, or the least particle of it. Not a
jot of the happiness and life which God infinitely possesses can be lost; it will be as durable to
everlasting, as it hath been possessed from everlasting.
</p>
<p>
    3. There is no succession in God. God is without succession or change. It is apart of eternity; “from
everlasting to everlasting he is God,” i. e. the same. God doth not only always remain in being, but he
always remains the same in that being: “thou art the same” (Psalm 102:27). The being of creatures is
successive; the being of God is permanent, and remains entire with all its perfections unchanged in an
infinite duration. Indeed, the first notion of eternity is to be without beginning and end, which notes to us
the duration of a being in regard of its existence; but to have no succession, nothing first or last, notes
rather the perfection of a being in regard of its essence. The creatures are in a perpetual flux; something is
acquired or something lost every day. A man is the same in regard of existence when he is a man, as he
was when he was a child; but there is a new succession of quantities and qualities in him. Every day he
acquires something till he comes to his maturity; every day he loseth something till he comes to his
period. A man is not the same at night that he was in the morning; something is expired, and something is
added; every day there is a change in his age, a change in his substance, a change in his accidents. But
God hath his whole being in one and the same point, or moment of eternity. He receives nothing as an
addition to what he was before; he loseth nothing of what he was before; he is always the same excellency
and perfection in the same infiniteness as ever. His years do not fail (Heb. 1:12), his years do not come
and go as others do; there is not this day, to-morrow, or yesterday, with him. As nothing is past or future
with him in regard of knowledge, but all things are present, so nothing is past or future in regard of his
essence. He is not in his essence this day what he was not before, or will be the next day and year what he
is not now. All his perfections are most perfect in him every moment; before all ages, after all ages.548 As
he hath his whole essence undivided in every place, as well as in an immense space, so he hath all his
being in one moment of time, as well as in infinite intervals of time. Some illustrate the difference
between eternity and time by the similitude of a tree, or a rock standing upon the side of a river, or shore
of the sea; the tree stands always the same and unmoved, while the waters of the river glide along at the
foot. The flux is in the river, but the tree acquires nothing but a diverse respect and relation of presence to
the various parts of the river as they flow. The waters of the river press on, and push forward one another,
and what the river had this minute, it hath not the same the next.549 So are all sublunary things in a
continual flux. And though the angels have no substantial change, yet they have an accidental; for the
actions of the angels this day are not the same individual actions which they performed yesterday: but in
God there is no change; he always remains the same. Of a creature, it may be said he was, or he is, or he
shall be; of God it cannot be said but only he is.550 He is what he always was, and he is what he always
will be; whereas a creature is what he was not, and will be what he is not now. As it may be said of the
flame of a candle, it is a flame: but it is not the same individual flame as was before, nor is it the same that
will be presently after; there is a continual dissolution of it into air, and a continual supply for the
generation of more. While it continues it may be said there is a flame; yet not entirely one, but in a
succession of parts. So of a man it may be said, he is in a succession of parts; but he is not the same that
he was, and will not be the same that he is. But God is the same, without any succession of parts and of
time; of him it may be said, “He is.” He is no more now than he was, and he shall be no more hereafter
than he is. God possesses a firm and absolute being, always constant to himself.551 He sees all things
sliding under him in a continual variation; he beholds the revolutions in the world without any change of
his most glorious and immovable nature. All other things pass from one state to another; from their
original, to their eclipse and destruction; but God possesses his being in one indivisible point, having
neither beginning, end, nor middle.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) There is no succession in the knowledge of God. The variety of successions and changes in the
world make not succession, or new objects in the Divine mind; for all things are present to him from
eternity in regard of his knowledge, though they are not actually present in the world, in regard of their
existence. He doth not know one thing now, and another anon; he sees all things at once; “Known unto
God are all things from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18); but in their true order of succession, as
they lie in the eternal council of God, to be brought forth in time. Though there be a succession and order
of things as they are wrought, there is yet no succession in God in regard of his knowledge of them. God
knows the things that shall be wrought, and the order of them in their being brought upon the stage of the
world; yet both the things and the order he knows by one act. Though all things be present with God, yet
they are present to him in the order of their appearance in the world, and not so present with him as if they
should be wrought at once. The death of Christ was to precede his resurrection in order of time; there is a
succession in this; both at once are known by God; yet the act of his knowledge is not exercised about
Christ as dying and rising at the same time; so that there is succession in things when there is no
succession in God’s knowledge of them. Since God knows time, he knows all things as they are in time;
he doth not know all things to be at once, though he knows at once what is, has been, and will be. All
things are past, present, and to come, in regard of their existence; but there is not past, present, and to
come, in regard of God’s knowledge of them,552 because he sees and knows not by any other, but by
himself; he is his own light by which he sees, his own glass wherein he sees; beholding himself, he
beholds all things.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) There is no succession in the decrees of God. He doth not decree this now, which he decreed not
before; for as his works were known from the beginning of the world, so his works were decreed from the
beginning of the world; as they are known at once, so they are decreed at once; there is a succession in the
execution of them; first grace, then glory; but the purpose of God for the bestowing of both, was in one
and the same moment of eternity. “He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
be holy” (Eph. 1:4): The choice of Christ, and the choice of some in him to be holy and to be happy, were
before the foundation of the world. It is by the eternal counsel of God all things appear in time; they
appear in their order according to the counsel and will of God from eternity. The redemption of the world
is after the creation of the world; but the decree whereby the world was created, and whereby it was
redeemed, was from eternity.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) God is his own eternity. He is not eternal by grant, and the disposal of any other, but by nature
and essence.553 The eternity of God is nothing else but the duration of God; and the duration of God is
nothing else but his existence enduring.554 If eternity were anything distinct from God, and not of the
essence of God, then there would be something which was not God, necessary to perfect God. As
immortality is the great perfection of a rational creature, so eternity is the choice perfection of God, yea,
the gloss and lustre of all others. Every perfection would be imperfect, if it were not always a perfection.
God is essentially whatsoever he is, and there is nothing in God but his essence. Duration or continuance
in being in creatures, differs from their being; for they might exist but for one instant, in which case they
may be said to have being, but not duration, because all duration includes prius et posterius. All creatures
may cease from being if it be the pleasure of God; they are not, therefore, durable by their essence, and
therefore are not their own duration, no more than they are their own existence. And though some
creatures, as angels, and souls, may be called everlasting, as a perpetual life is communicated to them by
God; yet they can never be called their own eternity, because such a duration is not simply necessary, nor
essential to them, but accidental, depending upon the pleasure of another; there is nothing in their nature
that can hinder them from losing it, if God, from whom they received it, should design to take it away; but
as God is his own necessity of existing, so he is his own duration in existing; as he doth necessarily exist
by himself, so he will always necessarily exist by himself.555
</p>
<p>
     (4.) Hence all the perfections of God are eternal. In regard of the Divine eternity, all things in God are
eternal; his power, mercy, wisdom, justice, knowledge. God himself were not eternal if any of his
perfections, which are essential to him, were not eternal also; he had not else been a perfect God from all
eternity, and so his whole self had not been eternal. If anything belonging to the nature of a thing be
wanting, it cannot be said to be that thing which it ought to be. If anything requisite to the nature of God
had been wanting one moment, he could not have been said to be an eternal God.
</p>
<p>
     II. God is eternal. The Spirit of God in Scripture condescends to our capacities in signifying the
eternity of God by days and years, which are terms belonging to time, whereby we measure it (Psalm
102:27). But we must no more conceive that God is bounded or measured by time, and hath succession of
days, because of those expressions, than we can conclude him to have a body, because members are
ascribed to him in Scripture, to help our conceptions of his glorious nature and operations. Though years
are ascribed to him, yet then are such as cannot be numbered, cannot be finished, since there is no
proportion between the duration of God, and the years of men. “The number of his years cannot be
searched out, for he makes small the drops of water; they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof”
(Job 36:26, 27). The numbers of the drops of rain which have fallen in all parts of the earth since the
creation of the world, if subtracted from the number of the years of God, would be found a small quantity,
a mere nothing, to the years of God. As all the nations in the world compared with God, are but as the
“drop of a bucket, worse than nothing, than vanity” (Isa. 40:15); so all the ages of the world, if compared
with God, amount not to so much as the one hundred thousandth part of a minute; the minutes from the
creation may be numbered, but the years of the duration of God being infinite, are without measure. As
one day is to the life of man, so are a thousand years to the life of God.
</p>
<p>
     The Holy Ghost expresseth himself to the capacity of man, to give us some notion of an infinite
duration, by a resemblance suited to the capacity of man.556 If a thousand years be but as a day to the life
of God, then as a year is to the life of man, so are three hundred and sixty-five thousand years to the life
of God; and as seventy years are to the life of man, so are twenty-five millions four hundred and fifty
thousand years to the life of God. Yet still, since there is no proportion between time and eternity, we
must dart our thoughts beyond all those; for years and days measure only the duration of created things,
and of those only that are material and corporeal, subject to the motion of the heavens, which makes days
and years.557 Sometimes this eternity is expressed by parts, as looking backward and forward; by the
differences of time, “past, present, and to come” (Rev. 1:8), “which was, and is, and is to come” (Rev.
4:8).558 Though this might be spoken of anything in being, though but for an hour, it was the last minute,
it is now, and it will be the next minute; yet the Holy Ghost would declare something proper to God, as
including all parts of time; he always was, is now, and always shall be. It might always be said of him, he
was, and it may always be said of him, he will be; there is no time when he began, no time when he shall
cease. It cannot be said of a creature he always was, he always is what he was, and he always will be what
he is; but God always is what he was, and always will be what he is; so that it is a very significant
expression of the eternity of God, as can be suited to our capacities.
</p>
<p>
     1. His eternity is evident, by the name God gives himself (Exod. 3:14): “And God said unto Moses, I
am that I am; thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, ‘I Am hath sent me unto you.’ ” This is the
name whereby he is distinguished from all creatures; I Am, is his proper name. This description being in
the present tense, shows that his essence knows no past, nor future; if it were he was, it would intimate he
were not now what he once was; if it were he will be, it would intimate he were not yet what he will be;
but I Am; I am the only being, the root of all beings; he is therefore, at the greatest distance from not
being, and that is eternal. So that is signifies his eternity, as well as his perfection and immutability. As I
Am speaks the want of no blessedness, so it speaks the want of no duration; and therefore the French,
wherever they find this word Jehovah, in the Scripture, which we translate Lord, and Lord eternal, render
it the Eternal,—I am always and immutably the same. The eternity of God is opposed to the volubility of
time, which is extended into past, present and to come. Our time is but a small drop, as a sand to all the
atoms and small particles of which the world is made; but God is an unbounded sea of being. “I Am that I
Am;” i. e. an infinite life; I have not that now, which I had not formerly; I shall not afterwards have that
which I have not now; I am that in every moment which I was, and will be in all moments of time;
nothing can be added to me, nothing can be detracted from me; there is nothing superior to him, which
can detract from him; nothing desirable that can be added to him. Now if there were any beginning and
end of God, any succession in him, he could not be “I Am;”559 for in regard of what was past, he would
not be; in regard of what was to come, he is not yet; and upon this account a heathen argues well;560 of all
creatures it may be said they were, or they will be; but of God it cannot be said anything else but est, God
is, because he fills an eternal duration. A creature cannot be said to be, if it be not yet, nor if it be not now,
but hath been.561 God only can be called “I Am;” all creatures have more of not being, than being; for
every creature was nothing from eternity, before it was made something in time; and if it be incorruptible
in its whole nature, it will be nothing to eternity after it hath been something in time; and if it be not
corruptible in its nature, as the angels, or in every part of its nature, as man in regard of his soul; yet it
hath not properly a being, because it is dependent upon the pleasure of God to continue it, or deprive it of
it; and while it is, it is mutable, and all mutability is a mixture of not being. If God therefore be properly
“I Am,” i. e. being, it follows that he always was; for if he were not always, he must, as was argued
before, be produced by some other, or by himself; by another he could not; then he had not been God, but
a creature; nor by himself, for then as producing, he must be before himself, as produced; he had been
before he was. And he always will be; for being “I Am,” having all being in himself, and the fountain of
all being to everything else, how can he ever have his name changed to I am not.
</p>
<p>
     2. God hath life in himself (John 5:26): “The Father hath life in himself;” he is the “living God;”
therefore “steadfast forever” (Dan. 6:26). He hath life by his essence, not by participation. He is a sun to
give light and life to all creatures, but receives not light or life from anything; and therefore he hath an
unlimited life, not a drop of life, but a fountain; not a spark of a limited life, but a life transcending all
bounds. He hath life in himself; all creatures have their life in him and from him. He that hath life in
himself doth necessarily exist, and could never be made to exist; for then he had not life in himself, but in
that which made him to. exist, and gave him life. What doth necessarily exist therefore, exists from
eternity; what hath being of itself could never be produced in time, could not want being one moment,
because it hath being from its essence, without influence of any efficient cause. When God pronounced
his name, “I Am that I Am,” angels and men were in being; the world had been created above two
thousand four hundred years; Moses, to whom he then speaks, was in being; yet God only is, because he
only hath the fountain of being in himself; but all that they were was a rivulet from him. He hath from
nothing else, that he Both subsist; everything else hath its subsistence from him as their root, as the beam
from the sun, as the rivers and fountains from the sea.562 All life is seated in God, as in its proper throne,
in its most perfect purity. God is life; it is in him originally, radically, therefore eternally. He is a pure act,
nothing but vigor and act; he hath by his nature that life which others have by his grant; whence the
Apostle saith (1 Tim. 6:16) not only that he is immortal, but he hath immortality in a full possession; fee
simple, not depending upon the will of another, but containing all things within himself. He that hath life
in himself, and is from himself, cannot but be. He always was, because he received his being from no
other, and none can take away that being which was not given by another. If there were any space before
he did exist, then there was something which made him to exist; life would not then be in him, but in that
which produced him into being; he could not then be God, but that other which gave him being would be
God.563 And to say God sprung into being by chance, when we see nothing in the world that is brought
forth by chance, but hath some cause of its existence, would be vain; for since God is a being, chance,
which is nothing, could not bring forth something; and by the same reason, that he sprung up by chance,
he might totally vanish by chance. What a strange notion of a God would this be! such a God that had no
life in himself but from chance! Since he hath life in himself, and that there was no cause of his existence,
he can have no cause of his limitation, and can no more be determined to a time, than he can to a place.
What hath life in itself, hath life without bounds, and can never desert it, nor be deprived of it; so that he
lives necessarily, and it is absolutely impossible that he should not live; whereas all other things “live, and
move, and have their being in him” (Acts 17:28); and as they live by his will, so they can return to
nothing at his word.
</p>
<p>
     3. If God were not eternal, he were not immutable in his nature. It is contrary to the nature of
immutability to be without eternity; for whatsoever begins, is changed in its passing from not being to
being. It began to be what it was not; and if it ends, it ceaseth to be what it was; it cannot therefore be said
to be God, if there were neither beginning or ending, or succession in it (Mal. 3:6): “I am the Lord, I
change not;” (Job 37:23): “Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out.” God argues here, saith
Calvin, from his unchangeable nature as Jehovah, to his immutability in his purpose. Had he not been
eternal, there had been the greatest change from nothing to something. A change of essence is greater than
a change of purpose. God is a sun glittering always in the same glory; no growing up in youth; no passing
on to age. If he were not without succession, standing in one point of eternity, there would be a change
from past to present, from present to future. The eternity of God is a shield against all kind of mutability.
If anything sprang up in the essence of God that was not there before, he could not be said to be either an
eternal, or an unchanged substance.
</p>
<p>
     4. God could not be an infinitely perfect Being, if he were not eternal. A finite duration is inconsistent
with infinite perfection Whatsoever is contracted within the limits of time, cannot swallow up all
perfections in itself. God hath an unsearchable perfection. “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst
thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?” (Job 11:7.) He cannot be found out: he is infinite, because he
is incomprehensible. Incomprehensibility ariseth from an infinite perfection, which cannot be fathomed
by the short line of man’s understanding. His essence in regard of its diffusion, and in regard of its
duration, is incomprehensible, as well as his action: if God, therefore, had beginning, he could not be
infinite; if not infinite, he did not possess the highest perfection; because a perfection might be conceived
beyond it. If his being could fail, he were not perfect; can that deserve the name of the highest perfection,
which is capable of corruption and dissolution? To be finite and limited, is the greatest imperfection, for it
consists in a denial of being. He could not be the most blessed Being if he were not always so, and should
not forever remain so; and whatsoever perfections he had, would be soured by the thoughts, that in time
they would cease, and so could not be pure affections, because not permanent; but “He is blessed from
everlasting to everlasting” (Psalm 41:13). Had he a beginning, he could not have all perfection without
limitation; he would have been limited by that which gave him beginning; that which gave him being
would be God, and not himself, and so more perfect than he: but since God is the most sovereign
perfection, than which nothing can be imagined perfecter by the most capacious understanding, He is
certainly “eternal;” being infinite, nothing can be added to him, nothing detracted from him.
</p>
<p>
     5. God could not be omnipotent, almighty, if he were not eternal. The title of almighty agrees not with
a nature that had a beginning; whatsoever hath a beginning was once nothing; and when it was nothing,
could act nothing: where there is no being there is no power. Neither doth the title of almighty agree with
a perishing nature: he can do nothing to purpose, that cannot preserve himself against the outward force
and violence of enemies, or against the inward causes of corruption and dissolution. No account is to be
made of man, because “his breath is in his nostrils” (Isa. 2:22); could a better account be made of God, if
he were of the like condition? He could not properly be almighty, that were not always mighty; if he be
omnipotent, nothing can impair him; he that hath all power, can have no hurt. If he doth whatsoever he
pleaseth, nothing can make him miserable, since misery consists in those things which happen against our
will.564 The almightiness and eternity of God are linked together: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and ending, saith the Lord, which was, and which is, and which is to come, the Almighty” (Rev. 1:8):
almighty because eternal, and eternal because almighty.
</p>
<p>
     6. God would not be the first cause of all if he were not eternal; but he is the first and the last; the first
cause of all things, the last end of all things:565 that which is the first cannot begin to be; it were not then
the first; it cannot cease to be: whatsoever is dissolved, is dissolved into that whereof it doth consist,
which was before it, and then it was not the first. The world might not have been; it was once nothing; it
must have some cause to call it out of nothing: nothing hath no power to make itself something; there is a
superior cause, by whose will and power it comes into being, and so gives all the creatures their distinct
forms.566 This power cannot but be eternal; it must be before the world; the founder must be before the
foundation; and his existence must be from eternity; or we must say nothing did exist from eternity:567 and
if there were no being from eternity, there could not now be any being in time. What we see, and what we
are, must arise from itself or some other; it cannot from itself: if anything made itself, it had a power to
make itself; it then had an active power before it had a being; it was something in regard of power, and
was nothing in regard of existence at the same time. Suppose it had a power to produce itself, this power
must be conferred upon it by another; and so the power of producing itself, was not from itself, but from
another; but if the power of being was from itself, why did it not produce itself before? why was it one
moment out of being?568 If there be any existence of things, it is necessary that that which was the “first
cause,” should “exist from eternity.” Whatsoever was the immediate cause of the world, yet the first and
chief cause wherein we must rest, must have nothing before it; if it had anything before it, it were not the
first; he therefore that is the first cause, must be without beginning; nothing must be before him; if he had
a beginning from some other, he could not be the first principle and author of all things; if he be the first
cause of all things, he must give himself a beginning, or be from eternity: he could not give himself a
beginning; whatsoever begins in time was nothing before, and when it was nothing, it could do nothing; it
could not give itself anything, for then it gave what it had not, and did what it could not. If he made
himself in time, why did he not make himself before? what hindered him? It was either because he could
not, or because he would not; if he could not, he always wanted power, and always would, unless it were
bestowed upon him, and then he could not be said to be from himself. If he would not make himself
before, then he might have made himself when he would: how had he the power of willing and nilling
without a being? Nothing cannot will or nill; nothing hath no faculties; so that it is necessary to grant
some eternal being, or run into inextricable labyrinths and mazes. If we deny some eternal being, we must
deny all being; our own being, the being of everything about us; unconceivable absurdities will arise. So,
then, if God were the cause of all things, he did exist before all things, and that from eternity.
</p>
<p>
     III. Eternity is only proper to God, and not communicable. It is as great a madness to ascribe eternity
to the creature, as to deprive the Lord of the creature of eternity.569 It is so proper to God, that when the
apostle would prove the deity of Christ, he proves it by his immutability and eternity, as well as his
creating power: “Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.” (Heb. 1:10–12) The argument had not
strength, if eternity belonged essentially to any but God; and therefore he is said only to have
“immortality” (1 Tim. 6:16): all other things receive their being from him, and can be deprived of their
being by him: all things depend on him; he of none all other things are like clothes, which would consume
if God preserved them not.
</p>
<p>
     Immortality is appropriated to God, i. e. an independent immortality. Angels and souls have an
immortality, but by donation from God, not by their own essence; dependent upon their Creator, not
necessary in their own nature: God might have annihilated them after he had created them; so that their
duration cannot properly be called an eternity, it being extrinsical to them, and dependent upon the will of
their Creator, by whom they may be extinguished; it is not an absolute and necessary, but a precarious
immortality. Whatsoever is not God, is temporary; whatsoever is eternal, is God. It is a contradiction to
say a creature can be eternal; as nothing eternal is created, so nothing created is eternal. What is distinct
from the nature of God cannot be eternal, eternity being the essence of God. Every creature, in the notion
of a creature, speaks a dependence on some cause, and therefore cannot be eternal. As it is repugnant to
the nature of God not to be eternal, so it is repugnant to the nature of a creature to be eternal; for then a
creature would be equal to the Creator, and the Creator, or the Cause, would not be before the creature, or
effect.570 It would be all one to admit many gods, as many eternals; and all one to say, God can be created,
as to say a creature can be unereated, which is to be eternal.
</p>
<p>
    1. Creation is a producing something from nothing. What was once nothing, cannot therefore be
eternal; not being was eternal; therefore its being could not be eternal, for it should be then before it was,
and would be something when it was nothing. It is the nature of a creature to be nothing before it was
created; what was nothing before it was, cannot be equal with God in an eternity of duration.
</p>
<p>
    2. There is no creature but is mutable, therefore not eternal. As it had a change from nothing to
something, so it may be changed from being to not being. If the creature were not mutable, it would be
most perfect, and so would not be a creature, but God; for God only is most perfect. It is as much the
essence of a creature to be mutable, as it is the essence of God to be immutable. Mutability and eternity
are utterly inconsistent.
</p>
<p>
    3. No creature is infinite, therefore not eternal: to be infinite in duration is all one as to be infinite in
essence. It is as reasonable to conceive a creature immense, filling all places at once, as eternal, extended
to all ages; because neither can be without infiniteness, which is the property of the Deity.571 A creature
may as well be without bounds of place, as limitations of time.
</p>
<p>
    4. No effect of an intellectual free agent can be equal in duration to its cause. The productions of
natural agents are as ancient often as themselves; the sun produceth a beam as old in time as itself; but
who ever heard of a piece of wise workmanship as old as the wise artificer? God produced a creature, not
necessarily and naturally, as the sun doth a beam, but freely, as an intelligent agent. The sun was not
necessary; it might be or not be, according to the pleasure of God. A free act of the will is necessary to
precede in order of time, as the cause of such effects as are purely voluntary.572 Those causes that act as
soon as they exist act naturally, necessarily, not freely, and cannot cease from acting. But suppose a
creature might have existed by the will of God from eternity; yet, as some think, it could not be said
absolutely, and in its own nature to be eternal, because eternity was not of the essence of it. The creature
could not be its own duration; for though it were from eternity, it might not have been from eternity,
because its existence depended upon the free will of God, who might have chose whether he would have
created it or no. God only is eternal; “the first and the last, the beginning and the end;” who, as he
subsisted before any creature had a being, so he will eternally subsist if all creatures were reduced to
nothing.
</p>
<p>
    IV. Use 1. Information. If God be of an eternal duration, then “Christ is God.” Eternity is the property
of God, but it is ascribed to Christ: “He is before all things” (Col. 1:17), i. e. all created things; he is
therefore no creature, and if no creature, eternal. “All things were created by him,” both in heaven and in
earth, angels, as well as men, whether they be thrones or dominions (ver. 16). If all things were his
creatures, then he is no creature; if he were, all things were not created by him, or he must create himself.
He hath no difference of time; for he is “the same yesterday, to-day, and forever:”573 the same, with the
name of God, “I Am,” which signifies his eternity. He is no more to-day than he was yesterday, nor will
be any other to-morrow than he is to-day; and therefore Melchizedec, whose descent, birth, and death,
father and mother, beginning and end of days, are not upon record, was a type of the existence of Christ
without difference of time; “Having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of
God” (Heb. 7:3). The suppression of his birth and death was intended by the Holy Ghost as a type of the
excellency of Christ’s person in regard of his eternity, and the duration of his charge in regard of his
priesthood. As there was an appearance of an eternity in the suppression of the race of Melchisedec, so
there is a true eternity in the Son of God. How could the eternity of the Son of God be expressed by any
resemblance so well, as by such a suppression of the beginning and end of this great person, different
from the custom of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament, who often records the generations and ends of
holy men; and why might not this, which was a kind of a shadow of eternity, be a representation of the
true eternity of Christ, as well as the restoration of Isaac to his father without death, is said to be a figure
of the resurrection of Christ after a real death?574 Melchisedec is only mentioned once (without any record
of his extraction) in his appearance to Abraham after his victory, as if he came from heaven only for that
action, and instantly disappeared again, as if he had been an eternal person. And Christ himself hints his
own eternity: “I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go
to the Father” (John 16:28). He goes to the Father as he came from the Father; he goes to the Father “for
everlasting,” so he came from the Father “from everlasting;” there is the same duration in coming forth
from the Father, as in returning to the Father. But more plainly: he speaks of a glory that he “had with the
Father before the world was” (John 17:5), when there was no creature in being. This is an actual glory,
and not only in decree; for a decreed glory believers had, and why may not every one of them say the
same words, “Father, glorify me with that glory which I had with thee before the world was,” if it were
only a glory in decree? Nay, it maybe said of every man, he was before the world was, because he was so
in decree. Christ speaks of something peculiar to him, a glory in actual possession before the world was:
“Glorify me, embrace, honor me as thy Son, whereas I have now been, in the eyes of the world, handled
disgracefully as a servant.” If it were only in decree, why is not the like expression used of others in
Scripture as well as of Christ? Why did he not use the same words for his disciples that were then with
him, who had a glory in decree? His eternity is also mentioned in the Old Testament: “The Lord
possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old” (Prov. 8:22). If he were the work of
God, he existed before himself, if he existed before all the works of God. It is so not properly meant of the
essential wisdom of God, since the discourse runs in the name of a person; and several passages there are
which belong not so much to the essential wisdom of God, as ver. 13: “The evil way and the froward
mouth do I hate,” which belongs rather to the holiness of God, than to the essential wisdom of God;
besides, it is distinguished from Jehovah, as possessed by, him, “and rejoicing before him.” Yet plainer:
“Out of thee,” i. e. Bethlehem, “shall he come forth to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been
from of old, from everlasting,” ‫“ עולם מימי‬from the ways of eternity” (Mic. 5:2). There are two goings
forth of Christ described, one from Bethlehem, in the days of his incarnation, and another from eternity.
The Holy Ghost adds, after his prediction of his incarnation, his going out from everlasting, that none
should doubt of his deity. If this going out from everlasting were only in the purpose of God, it might be
said of David, and of every creature; and in Isa. 9:6 he is particularly called the “everlasting,” or “eternal
Father;” not the Father in the Trinity, but a Father to us; yet “eternal,” the “Father of eternity.” As he is
the “mighty God,” so he is “the everlasting Father.” Can such a title be ascribed to any whose being
depends upon the will of another, and may be dashed out at the pleasure of a superior? As the eternity of
God is the ground of all religion, so the eternity of Christ is the ground of the Christian religion. Could
our sins be perfectly expiated had he not an eternal divinity to answer for the offences committed against
an eternal God? Temporary sufferings had been of little validity, without an infiniteness and eternity in
his person to add weight to his passion.
</p>
<p>
    2. If God be eternal, he knows all things as present. All things are present to him in his eternity; for
this is the notion of eternity, to be without succession.575 If eternity be one indivisible point, and is not
diffused into preceding and succeeding parts, then that which is known in it or by it is perceived without
any succession, for knowledge is as the substance of the person knowing; if that hath various actions and
distinct from itself, then it understands things in differences of time as time presents them to view. But,
since God’s being depends not upon the revolutions of time, so neither does his knowledge; it exceeds all
motions of years and days, comprehends infinite spaces of past and future. God considers all things in his
eternity in one simple knowledge, as if they were now acted before him: “Known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the world;” ἀπ̓ αἰῶνος, à seculo, “from eternity” (Acts 15:18). God’s
knowledge is co-eternal with him; if he knows that in time which he did not not know from eternity, he
would not be eternally perfect, since knowledge is the perfection of an intelligent nature.
</p>
<p>
    3. How bold and foolish is it for a mortal creature to censure the counsels and actions of an eternal
God, or be too curious in his inquisitions! It is by the consideration of the unsearchable number of the
years of God that Elihu checks too bold inquiries: “who hath enjoined him his way, or who can say, Thou
hast wrought iniquity? Behold, God is great, and we know him not; neither can the number of his years be
searched out.”576 Eternity sets God above our inquiries and censures. Infants of a day old are not able to
understand the acts of wise and gray heads: shall we, that are of so short a being and understanding as
yesterday, presume to measure the motions of eternity by our scanty intellects? We that cannot foresee an
unexpected accident which falls in to blast a well-laid design, and run a ship many leagues back from the
intended harbor; we cannot understand the reason of things we see done in time, the motions of the sea,
the generation of rain, the nature of light, the sympathies and antipathies of the creatures; and shall we
dare to censure the actions of an eternal God, so infinitely beyond our reach? The counsels of a boundless
being are not to be scanned by the brain of a silly worm, that hath breathed but a few minutes in the
world. Since eternity cannot be comprehended in time, it is not to be judged by a creature of time: “Let us
remember to magnify his works which we behold,” because he is eternal, which is the exhortation of
Elihu, backed by this doctrine of God’s eternity (Job 36:24), and not accuse any work of him who is the
“Ancient of Days,” or presume to direct him of whose eternity we come infinitely short. Whenever,
therefore, any unworthy notion of the counsels and works of God is suggested to us by Satan, or our own
corrupt hearts, let us look backward to God’s eternal and our own short duration, and silence ourselves
with the same question wherewith God put a stop to the reasoning of Job—“Where wast thou when I laid
the foundations of the earth?” (Job 38:4), and reprove ourselves for our curiosity, since we are of so short
a standing, and were nothing when the eternal God laid the first stone of the world.
</p>
<p>
    4. What a folly and boldness is there in sin, since an eternal God is offended thereby! All sin is
aggravated by God’s eternity. The blackness of the heathen idolatry was in changing the glory of the
incorruptible God (Rom. 1:23); erecting resemblances of him contrary to his immortal nature; as if the
eternal God, whose life is as unlimited as eternity, were like those creatures whose beings are measured
by the short ell of time, which are of a corruptible nature, and daily passing on to corruption; they could
not really deprive God of his glory and immortality, but they did in estimation. There is in the nature of
every sin a tendency to reduce God to a not being. He that thinks unworthily of God, or acts unworthily
towards him, doth (as much as in him lies) sully and destroy these two perfections of his, immutability
and eternity. It is a carriage, as if he were as contemptible as a creature that were but of yesterday, and
shall not remain in being to-morrow. He that would put an end to God’s glory by darkening it, would put
an end to God’s life by destroying it. He that should love a beast with as great an affection as he loves a
man, contemns a rational nature; and he that loves a perishing thing with the same affection he should
love an everlasting God, contemns his eternity; he debaseth the duration of God below that of the world.
The low valuation of God speaks him in his esteem no better than withering grass, or a gourd, which lasts
for a night; and the creature which possesses his affection, to be a good that lasts forever. How foolish,
then, is every sin that tends to destroy a being that cannot destroy or desert himself; a Being, without
whose eternity the sinner himself could not have had the capacity of a being to affront him! How base is
that which would not let the works of God remain in their established posture! How much more base is
not enduring the fountain and glory of all beings, that would not only put an end to the beauty of the
world, but the eternity of God!
</p>
<p>
    5. How dreadful is it to lie under the stroke of an eternal God! His eternity is as great a terror to him
that hates him, as it is a comfort to him that loves him; because he is the “living God, an everlasting king,
the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation” (Jer. 10:10). Though God be least in their thoughts,
and is made light of in the world, yet the thoughts of God’s eternity, when he comes to judge the world,
shall make the slighters of him tremble. That the Judge and punisher lives forever, is the greatest
grievance to a soul in misery, and adds an inconceivable weight to it, above what the infiniteness of God’s
executive power could do without that duration. His eternity makes the punishment more dreadful than
his power; his power makes it sharp, but his eternity renders it perpetual; ever to endure, is the sting at the
end of every lash. And how sad is it to think that God lays his eternity to pawn for the punishment of
obstinate sinners, and engageth it by an oath, that he will “whet his glittering sword,” that his “hand shall
take hold of judgment,” that he will “render vengeance to his enemies, and a reward to them that hate
him;” a reward proportioned to the greatness of their offences, and the glory of an eternal God! “I lift up
my hand to heaven, and say, I live forever;” (Deut. 32:40, 41): i. e., as surely as I live forever, I will whet
my glittering sword. As none can convey good with a perpetuity, so none can convey evil with such a
lastingness as God. It is a great loss to lose a ship richly fraught in the bottom of the sea, never to be cast
upon the shore; but how much greater is it to lose eternally a sovereign God, which we were capable of
eternally enjoying, and undergo an evil as durable as that God we slighted, and were in a possibility of
avoiding! The miseries of men after this life are not eased, but sharpened, by the life and eternity of God.
</p>
<p>
     Use 2. Of comfort. What foundation of comfort can we have in any of God’s attributes, were it not for
his infiniteness and eternity, though he be “merciful, good, wise, faithful?” What support could there be,
if they were perfections belonging to a corruptible God? What hopes of a resurrection to happiness can we
have, or of the duration of it, if that God that promised it were not immortal to continue it, as well as
powerful to effect it? His power were not Almighty, if his duration were not eternal.
</p>
<p>
     1. If God be eternal, his covenant will be so. It is founded upon the eternity of God; the oath whereby
he confirms it, is by his life. Since there is none greater than himself, he swears by himself (Heb. 6:13), or
by his own life, which he engageth together with his eternity for the full performance; so that if he lives
forever, the covenant shall not be disannulled; it is an “immutable counsel” (ver. 16, 17). The
immutability of his counsel follows the immutability of his nature. Immutability and eternity go hand in
hand together. The promise of eternal life is as ancient as God himself in regard of the purpose of the
promise, or in regard of the promise made to Christ for us. “Eternal life which God promised before the
world began.” (Tit. 1:2): As it hath an ante-eternity, so it hath a posteternity; therefore the gospel, which is
the new covenant published, is termed the “everlasting gospel” (Rev. 14:6), which can no more be altered
and perish, than God can change and vanish into nothing; he can as little morally deny his truth, as he can
naturally desert his life. The covenant is there represented in a green color, to note its perpetual verdure;
the rainbow, the emblem of the covenant “about the throne, was like to an emerald” (Rev. 4:3), a stone of
a green color, whereas the natural rainbow had many colors; this but one, to signify its eternity.
</p>
<p>
     2. If God be eternal, he being our God in covenant, is an eternal good and possession. “This God is
our God forever and ever” (Psalm 48:14): “He is a dwelling place in all generations.” We shall traverse
the world awhile, and then arrive at the blessings Jacob wished for Joseph, “the blessings of the
everlasting hills” (Gen. 49:26). If an estate of a thousand pound per annum render a man’s life
comfortable for a short term, how much more may the soul be swallowed up with joy in the enjoyment of
the Creator, whose years never fail, who lives forever to be enjoyed, and can keep us in life forever to
enjoy him! Death, indeed, will seize upon us by God’s irreversible order, but the immortal Creator will
make him disgorge his morsel, and land us in a glorious immortality; our souls at their dissolution, and
our bodies at the resurrection, after which they shall remain forever, and employ the extent of that
boundless eternity, in the fruition of the sovereign and eternal God; for it is impossible that the believer,
who is united to the immortal God that is from everlasting to everlasting, can ever perish; for being in
conjunction with him who is an ever-flowing fountain of life, he cannot suffer him to remain in the jaws
of death. While God is eternal, and always the same, it is not possible that those that partake of his
spiritual life, should not also partake of his eternal. It is from the consideration of the endlessness of the
years of God that the church comforts herself that “her children shall continue, and their seed be
established forever” (Psalm 102:27, 28). And from the eternity of God Habakkuk (chap. 1:12) concludes
the eternity of believers, “Art not thou from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One? we shall not die,
O Lord.” After they are retired from this world, they shall live forever with God, without any change by
the multitude of those imaginable years and ages that shall run forever. It is that God that hath neither
beginning nor end, that is our God; who hath not only immortality in himself, but immortality to give out
to others. As he hath “abundance of spirit” to quicken them (Mal. 2:15), so he hath abundance of
immortality to continue them. It is only in the consideration of this a man can with wisdom say, “Soul,
take thy ease; thou hast goods laid up for many years” (Luke 12:19, 20): to say it of any other possession
is the greatest folly in the judgment of our Saviour. “Mortality shall be swallowed up of immortality;”
“rivers of pleasure” shall be “for evermore.” Death is a word never spoken there by any; never heard by
any in that possession of eternity; it is forever put out as one of Christ’s conquered enemies. The
happiness depends upon the presence of God, with whom believers shall be forever present. Happiness
cannot perish as long as God lives; he is the first and the last; the first of all delights, nothing before him;
the last of all pleasures, nothing beyond him; a paradise of delights in every point, without a flaming
sword.
</p>
<p>
     3. The enjoyment of God will be as fresh and glorious after many ages, as it was at first. God is
eternal, and eternity knows no change; there will then be the fullest possession without any decay in the
object enjoyed. There can be nothing past, nothing future; time neither adds to it, nor detracts from it; that
infinite fulness of perfection which flourisheth in him now, will flourish eternally, without any
discoloring of it in the least, by those innumerable ages that shall run to eternity, much less any despoiling
him of them: “He is the same in his endless duration” (Psalm 102:27). As God is, so will the eternity of
him be, without succession, without division; the fulness of joy will be always present; without past to be
thought of with regret for being gone; without future to be expected with tormenting desires. When we
enjoy God, we enjoy him in his eternity without any flux; an entire possession of all together, without the
passing away of pleasures that may be wished to return, or expectation of future joys which might be
desired to hasten. Time is fluid, but eternity is stable; and after many ages, the joys will be as savory and
satisfying as if they had been but that moment first tasted by our hungry appetites. When the glory of the
Lord shall rise upon you, it shall be so far from ever setting, that after millions of years are expired, as
numerous as the sands on the seashore, the sun, in the light of whose countenance you shall live, shall be
as bright as at the first appearance; he will be so far from ceasing to flow, that he will flow as strong, as
full, as at the first communication of himself in glory to the creature. God, therefore, as sitting upon his
throne of grace, and acting according to his covenant, is like a jasper-stone, which is of a green color, a
color always delightful (Rev. 4:3); because God is always vigorous and flourishing; a pure act of life,
sparkling new and fresh rays of life and light to the creature, flourishing with a perpetual spring, and
contenting the most capacious desire; forming your interest, pleasure, and satisfaction; with an infinite
variety, without any change or succession; he will have variety to increase delights, and eternity to
perpetuate them; this will be the fruit of the enjoyment of an infinite and eternal God: be is not a cistern,
but a fountain, wherein water is always living, and never putrefies.
</p>
<p>
     4. If God be eternal, here is a strong ground of comfort against all the distresses of the church, and the
threats of the church’s enemies. God’s abiding forever is the plea Jeremy makes for his return to his
forsaken church: “Thou, O Lord, remainest forever; thy throne from generation to generation” (Lam. 5:19,
20). The church is weak; created things are easily cut off; what prop is there, but that God that lives
forever? What, though Jerusalem lost its bulwarks, the temple were defaced, the land wasted; yet the God
of Jerusalem sits upon an eternal throne, and from everlasting to everlasting there is no diminution of his
power. The prophet intimates in this complaint, that it is not agreeable to God’s eternity to forget his
people, to whom he hath from eternity borne good-will. In the greatest confusions, the church’s eyes are
to be fixed upon the eternity of God’s throne, where he sits as governor of the world. No creature can take
any comfort in this perfection, but the church; other creatures depend upon God, but the church is united
to him. The first discovery of the name “I am,” which signifies the divine eternity, as well as
immutability, was for the comfort of the “oppressed Israelites in Egypt” (Exod. 3:14, 15): it was then
published from the secret place of the Almighty, as the only strong cordial to refresh them: it hath not yet,
it shall not ever lose its virtue in any of the miseries that have, or shall successively befall the church. It is
a comfort as durable as the God whose name it is; he is still “I Am;” and the same to the church, as he was
then to his Israel. His spiritual Israel have a greater right to the glories of it, than the carnal Israel could
have. No oppression can be greater than theirs; what was a comfort suited to that distress, hath the same
suitableness to every other oppression. It was not a temporary name, but a name forever; his “memorial to
all generations” (ver. 15), and reacheth to the church of the Gentiles with whom he treats as the God of
Abraham; ratifying that covenant by the Messiah, which he made with Abraham, the father of the faithful.
The church’s enemies are not to be feared; they may spring as the grass, but soon after do wither by their
own inward principles of decdy, or are cut down by the hand of God (Psalm 92:7–9). They may be
instruments of the anger of God, but “they shall be scattered as the workers of iniquity by the hand of the
Lord, that is high for evermore” (ver. 8), and is engaged by his promise, to preserve a church in the world.
They may threaten, but their breath may vanish as soon as their threatenings are pronounced; for they
carry their breath in no surer a place than their own nostrils, upon which the eternal God can put his hand,
and sink them with all their rage. Do the prophets and instructers of the church “live forever” (Zech. 1:5)?
No: shall, then, the adversaries and disturbers of the church live forever? They shall vanish as a shadow;
their being depends upon the eternal God of the faithful, and the everlasting Judge of the wicked. He that
inhabits eternity is above them that inhabit mortality; and must, whether they will or no, “say to
corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister” (Job 17:14.) When
they will act with a confidence, as if they were living gods, he will not be mated; but evidence himself to
be a living God above them. Why, then, should mortal men be feared in their frowns, when an immortal
God hath promised protection in his word, and lives forever to perform it?
</p>
<p>
     5. Hence follows another comfort; since God is eternal, he hath as much power as will to be as good
as his word. His promises are established upon his eternity; and his perfection is a main ground of trust;
“Trust in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength” (Isa. 26:4). ‫ביה יהוח צור צול טם‬
His name is doubled; that name, Jah and Jehovah, which was always the strength of his people; and not a
single one, but the strength or rock of eternities: not a failing, but an eternal truth and power; that as his
strength is eternal, so our trust in him should imitate his eternity in its perpetuity; and therefore in the
despondency of his people, as if God had forgot his promises, and made no account of them, or his word,
and were weary of doing good, he calls them to reflect on what they had heard of his eternity, which is
attended with immutability, who hath an infiniteness of power to perform his will, and an infiniteness of
understanding to judge of the right seasons of it. His wisdom, will, truth, have always been, and will to
eternity be the same (Isa. 40:27, 28). He wants not life, any more than love, forever to help us; since his
word is past, he will never fail us; since his life continues, he can never be out of a capacity to relieve us;
and, therefore, whenever we foolishly charge him by our distrustful thoughts, we forget his love, which
made the promise, and his eternal life, which can accomplish it. As his word is the bottom of our trust,
and his truth is the assurance of his sincerity, so his eternity is the assurance of his ability to perform: “His
word stands forever” (ver. 8). A man may be my friend this day, and be in another world to-morrow; and
though he be never so sincere in his word, yet death snaps his life asunder, and forbids the execution. But
as God cannot die, so he cannot lie; because he is the eternity of Israel: “The strength of Israel will not lie,
nor repent,” ‫ נצח‬perpetuity, or eternity of Israel (1 Sam. 15:29). Eternity implies immutability; we could
have no ground for our hopes, if we knew him not to be longer lived than ourselves. The Psalmist beats
off our hands from trust in men, “because their breath goes forth, they return to their earth, and in that day
their thoughts perish” (Psalm 146:3, 4). And if the God of Jacob were like them, what happiness could we
have in making him our help? As his sovereignty in giving precepts had not been a strong ground of
obedience, without considering him as an eternal lawgiver, who could maintain his rights; so his kindness
in making the promises had not been a strong ground of confidence, without considering him as an eternal
promiser, whose thoughts and whose life can never perish.577 And this may be one reason why the Holy
Ghost mentions so often the post-eternity of God, and so little his ante-eternity; because that is the
strongest foundation of our faith and hope, which respects chiefly that which is future, and not that which
is past; yet, indeed, no assurance of his after-eternity can be had, if his ante-eternity be not certain. If he
had a beginning, he may have an end; and if he had a change in his nature, he might have in his counsels;
but since all the resolves of God are as himself is, eternal, and all the promises of God are the fruits of his
counsel, therefore they cannot be changed; if he should change them for the better, he would not have
been eternally wise, to know what was best; if for the worse, he had not been eternally good or just. Men
may break their promises, because they are made without foresight; but God, that inhabits eternity,
foreknows all things that shall be done under the sun, as if they had been then acting before him; and
nothing can intervene, or work a change in his resolves; because the least circumstances were eternally
foreseen by him. Though there may be variations, and changes to our sight, the wind may tack about, and
every hour new and cross accidents happen; yet the eternal God, who is eternally true to his word, sits at
the helm, and the winds and the waves obey him. And though he should defer his promise a thousand
years, yet he is “not slack” (2 Pet. 3:8, 9); for he defers it but a day to his eternity: and who would not
with comfort stay a day in expectation of a considerable advantage?
</p>
<p>
    Use 3. For exhortation. 1. To something which concerns us in ourselves; 2. To something which
concerns us with respect to God.
</p>
<p>
    1. To something which concerns us in ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Let us be deeply affected with our sins long since committed. Though they are past with us, they
are, in regard of God’s eternity, present with him; there is no succession in eternity, as there is in time. All
things are before God at once; our sins are before him, as if committed this moment, though committed
long ago. As he is what he is in regard of duration, so he knows what he knows in regard of knowledge.
As he is not more than he was, nor shall not be any more than he is, so he always knew what he knows,
and shall not cease to know what he now knows. As himself, so his knowledge, is one indivisible point of
eternity. He knows nothing but what he did know from eternity; he shall know no more for the future than
he now knows. Our sins being present with him in his eternity, should be present with us in our regard of
remembrance of them, and sorrow for them.
</p>
<p>
    What though many years are lapsed, much time run out, and our iniquities almost blotted out of our
memory; yet since a thousand years are, in God’s sight, and in regard of his eternity, but as a day—“A
thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is past, and as a watch in the night” (Psalm
90:4)—they are before him. For suppose a man were as old as the world, above five thousand six hundred
years; the sins committed five thousand years ago, are, according to that rule, but as if they were
committed five days ago; so that sixty-two years are but as an hour and a half; and the sins committed
forty years since as if they were committed but this present hour. But if we will go further, and consider
them but as a watch of the night, about three hours (for the night, consisting of twelve hours, was divided
into set watches), then a thousand years are but as three hours in the sight of God; and then sins
committed sixty years ago are but as if they were committed within this five minutes. Let none of us set
light by the iniquities committed many years ago, and imagine that length of time can wipe out their guilt.
No: let us consider them in relation to God’s eternity, and excite an inward remorse, as if they had been
but the birth of this moment.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Let the consideration of God’s eternity abate our pride. This is the design of the verses following
the text: the eternity of God being so sufficient to make us understand our own nothingness, which ought
to be one great end of man, especially as fallen. The eternity of God should make us as much disesteem
ourselves, as the excellency of God made Job abhor himself (Job 42:5, 6. His excellency should humble
us under a sense of our vanity, and his eternity under a sense of the shortness of our duration. If man
compares himself with other creatures, he may be too sensible of his greatness; but if he compares himself
with God, he cannot but be sensible of his baseness.
</p>
<p>
    1st. In regard of our impotence to comprehend this eternity of God. How little do we know, how little
can we know, of God’s eternity! We cannot fully conceive it, much less express it; we have but a brutish
understanding in all those things, as Agur said of himself (Prov. 3:7). What is infinite and eternal, cannot
be comprehended by finite and temporary creatures; if it could, it would not be infinite and eternal;578 for
to know a thing, is to know the extent and cause of it. It is repugnant to eternity to be known, because it
hath no limits, no causes; the most soaring understanding cannot have a proportionable understanding of
it. What disproportion is there between a drop of water and the sea in their greatness and motion; yet by a
drop we may arrive to a knowledge of the nature of the sea, which is a mass of drops joined together; but
the longest duration of times cannot make us know what eternity is, because there is no proportion
between time and eternity. The years of God are as numberless as his thoughts (Psalm 40:5), and our
minds as far from reckoning the one as the other. If our understandings are too gross to comprehend the
majesty of his infinite works, they are much more too sort to comprehend the infiniteness of his eternity.
</p>
<p>
    2d. In regard of the vast disproportion of our duration to this duration of God.
</p>
<p>
    [1.] We have more of nothing than being. We were nothing from an unbegun eternity, and we might
have been nothing to an endless eternity, had not God called us into being; and if he please we may be
nothing by as short an annihilating word, as we were something by a creating word. As it is the
prerogative of God to be, “I am that I am;” so it is the property of a creature to be, “I am not what I am;” I
am not by myself what I am, but by the indulgence of another. I was nothing formerly; I may be nothing
again, unless he that is “I Am” make me to subsist what I now am. Nothing is as much the title of the
creature as being is the title of God. Nothing is so holy as God, because nothing hath being as God:
“There is none holy as the Lord, for there is none besides thee” (1 Sam. 2:2). Man’s life is an image, a
dream, which are next to nothing; and if compared with God, worse than nothing; a nullity as well as a
vanity, because “with God only is the fountain of life” (Psalm 36:9). The creature is but a drop of life
from him, dependent on him: a drop of water is a nothing if compared with the vast conflux of waters and
numberless drops in the ocean. How unworthy is it for dust and ashes, kneaded together in time, to strut
against the Father of eternity! Much more unworthy for that which is nothing, worse than nothing, to
quarrel with that which is only being, and equal himself with Him that inhabits eternity.
</p>
<p>
    [2.] What being we have had a beginning. After an unaccountable eternity was run out, in the very
dregs of time, a few years ago we were created, and made of the basest and vilest dross of the world, the
slime and dust of the earth; made of that wherewith birds build their nests; made of that which creeping
things make their habitation, and beasts trample upon. How monstrous is pride in such a creature, to
aspire, as if he were the Father of eternity, and as eternal as God, and so his own eternity!
</p>
<p>
    [3.] What being we have is but of a short duration in regard of our life in this world. Our life is in a
constant change and flux; we remain not the same an entire day; youth quickly succeeds childhood, and
age as speedily treads upon the heels of youth; there is a continual defluxion of minutes, as there is of
sands in a glass. He is as a watch wound up at the beginning of his life, and from that time is running
down, till he comes to the bottom; some part of our lives is cut off every day, every minute. Life is but a
moment: what is past cannot be recalled, what is future cannot be ensured. If we enjoy this moment, we
have lost that which is past, and shall presently lose this by the next that is to come. The short duration of
men is set out in Scripture by such creatures as soon disappear: a worm (Job 25:6), that can scarce outlive
a winter; grass, that withers by the summer sun. Life is a “flower,” soon withering (Job 14:2); a “vapor,”
soon vanishing (James 4:14); a “smoke,” soon disappearing (Psalm 102:3). The strongest man is but
compacted dust; the fabric must moulder; the highest mountain falls and comes to naught.
</p>
<p>
     Time gives place to eternity; we live now, and die tomorrow. Not a man since the world began ever
lived a day in God’s sight; for no man ever lived a thousand years. The longest day of any man’s life
never amounted to twenty-four hours in the account of divine eternity: a life of so many hundred years,
with the addition “he died,” makes up the greatest part of the history of the patriarchs (Gen. 5.); and since
the life of man hath been curtailed, if any be in the world eighty years, he scarce properly lives sixty of
them, since the fourth part of time is at least consumed in sleep. A greater difference there is between the
duration of God and that of a creature, than between the life of one for a minute, and the life of one that
should live as many years as the whole globe of heaven and earth, if changed into papers, could contain
figures. And this life, though but of a short duration according to the period God hath determined, is
easily cut off; the treasure of life is deposited in a brittle vessel. A small stone hitting against
Nebuchadnezzar’s statue will tumble it down into a poor and nasty grave; a grape-stone, the bone of a
fish, a small fly in the throat, a moist damp, are enough to destroy an earthly eternity, and reduce it to
nothing. What a nothing, then, is our shortness, if compared with God’s eternity; our frailty, with God’s
duration! How humble, then, should perishing creatures be before an eternal God, with whom “our days
are as a hand’s breadth, and our age as nothing!” (Psalm 39:5.) The angels, that have been of as long a
duration as heaven and earth, tremble before him; the heavens melt at his presence; and shall we, that are
but of yesterday, approach a divine eternity with unhumbled souls, and offer the calves of our lips with
the pride of devils, and stand upon our terms with him, without falling upon our faces, with a sense that
we are but dust and ashes, and creatures of time? How easy is it to reason out man’s humility! but how
hard is it to reason man into it!
</p>
<p>
     (3.) Let the consideration of God’s eternity take off our love and confidence from the world, and the
things thereof. The eternity of God reproaches a pursuit of the world, as preferring a momentary pleasure
before an everlasting God; as though a temporal world could be a better supply than a God whose years
never fail. Alas! what is this earth men are so greedy of, and will get, though by blood and sweat? What is
this whole earth, if we had the entire possession of it, if compared with the vast heavens, the seat of angels
and blessed spirits? It is but as an atom to the greatest mountain, or as a drop of dew to the immense
ocean. How foolish is it to prefer a drop before the sea, or an atom before the world! The earth is but a
point to the sun; the sun with its whole orb, but a little part of the heavens if compared with the whole
fabric. If a man had the possession of all those, there could be no comparison between those that have had
a beginning, and shall have an end, and God who is without either of them. Yet how many are there that
make nothing of the divine eternity, and imagine an eternity of nothing!
</p>
<p>
     [1.] The world hath been but of a short standing. It is not yet six thousand years since the foundations
of it were laid, and therefore it cannot have a boundless excellency, as that God, who hath been from
everlasting, Both possess. If Adam had lived to this day, and been as absolute lord of his posterity, as he
was of the other creatures, had it been a competent object to take up his heart? had he not been a madman,
to have preferred this little created pleasure before an everlasting uncreated God? a thing that had a
dependent beginning, before that which had an independent eternity?
</p>
<p>
     [2.] The beauties of the world are transitory and perishing. The whole world is nothing else but a fluid
thing; the fashion of it is a pageantry, “passing away” (1 Cor. 7:31): though the glories of it might be
conceived greater than they are, yet they are not consistent, but transient; there cannot be an entire
enjoyment of them, because they grow up and expire every moment, and slip away between our fingers
while we are using them. Have we not heard of God’s dispersing the greatest empires like “chaff before a
whirlwind,” or as “smoke out of a chimney” (Hos. 13:3), which, though it appears as a compacted cloud,
as if it would choke the sun, is quickly scattered into several parts of the air, and becomes invisible?
Nettles have often been heirs to stately palaces, as God threatens Israel (Hos. 9:6). We cannot promise
ourselves over night anything the next day. A kingdom with the glory of a throne may be cut off in a
morning (Hos. 10:15). The new wine may be taken from the mouth when the vintage is ripe; the
devouring locust may snatch away both the hopes of that and the harvest (Joel 1:15); they are, therefore,
things which are not, and nothing cannot be a fit object for confidence or affection; “Wilt thou set thy
eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves whigs” (Prov. 23:5). They are not
properly beings, because they are not stable, but flitting. They are not, because they may not be the next
moment to us what they are this: they are but cisterns, not springs, and broken cisterns, not sound and
stable; no solidity in their substance, nor stability in their duration. What a foolish thing is it then, to
prefer a transient felicity, a mere nullity, before an eternal God! What a senseless thing would it be in a
man to prefer the map of a kingdom, which the band of a child can tear in pieces, before the kingdom
shadowed by it! How much more inexcusable is it to value things, that are so far from being eternal, that
they are not so much as dusky resemblances of an eternity. Were the things of the world more glorious
than they are, yet they are but as a counterfeit sun in a cloud, which comes short of the true sun in the
heavens, both in glory and duration; and to esteem them before God, is inconceivably baser, than if a man
should value a party-colored bubble in the air, before a durable rock of diamonds. The comforts of this
world are as candles, that will end in a snuff; whereas the felicity that flows from an eternal God, is like
the sun, that shines more and more to a perfect day.
</p>
<p>
     [3.] They cannot therefore be fit for a soul, which was made to have an interest in God’s eternity. The
soul being of a perpetual nature, was made for the fruition of an eternal good; without such a good it can
never be perfect. Perfection, that noble thing, riseth not from anything in this world, nor is a title due to a
soul while in this world; it is then they are said to be made perfect, when they arrive at that entire
conjunction with the eternal God in another life (Heb. 7:23). The soul cannot be ennobled by an
acquaintance with these things, or established by a dependence on them; they cannot confer what a
rational nature should desire, or supply it with what it wants. The soul hath a resemblance to God in a
post-eternity; why should it be drawn aside by the blandishments of earthly things, to neglect its true
establishment, and lackey after the body, which is but the shadow of the soul, and was made to follow it
and serve it? But while it busieth itself altogether in the concerns of a perishing body, and seeks
satisfaction in things that glide away, it becomes rather a body than soul, descends below its nature,
reproacheth that God who hath imprinted upon it an image of his own eternity, and loseth the comfort of
the everlastingness of its Creator. How shall the whole world, if our lives were as durable as that, be a
happy eternity to us, who have souls that shall survive all the delights of it, which must fry in those flames
that shall fire the whole frame of nature at the general conflagration of the world? (2 Pet. 3:10.)
</p>
<p>
     [4.] Therefore let us provide for a happy interest in the eternity of God. Man is made for an eternal
state. The soul hath such a perfection in its nature, that it is fit for eternity, and cannot display all its
operations but in eternity. To an eternity it must go, and live as long as God himself lives. Things of a
short duration are not proportioned to a soul made for an eternal continuance; to see that it be a
comfortable eternity, is worth all our care. Man is a forecasting creature, and considers not only the
present, but the future too, in his provisions for his family; and shall he disgrace his nature in casting off
all consideration of a future eternity? Get possession, therefore, of the eternal God. “A portion in this life”
is the lot of those who shall be forever miserable (Psalm 17:14). But God, “an everlasting portion,” is the
lot of them that are designed for happiness. “God is my portion forever” (Psalm 73:26). “Time is short.”
(1 Cor. 7:29) The whole time for which God designed this building of the world, is of a little compass; it
is a stage erected for rational creatures to act their parts upon for a few thousand years; the greatest part of
which time is run out; and then shall time, like a rivulet, fall into the sea of eternity, from whence it
sprung. As time is but a slip of eternity, so it will end in eternity; our advantages consist in the present
instant; what is past never promised a return, and cannot be fetched back by all our vows. What is future,
we cannot promise ourselves to enjoy; we may be snatched away before it comes. Every minute that
passeth, speaks the fewer remaining, till the time of death; and as we are every hour further from our
beginning, we are nearer our end. The child born this day grows up, to grow nothing at last. In all ages
there is “but a step between us and death,” as David said of himself (1 Sam. 20:3). The little time that
remains for the devil till the day of judgment, envenoms his wrath; he rageth, because “his time is short”
(Rev. 12:12). The little time that remains between this moment and our death, should quicken our
diligence to inherit the endless and unchangeable eternity of God.
</p>
<p>
     [5.] Often meditate on the eternity of God. The holiness, power, and eternity of God, are the
fundamental articles of all religion, upon which the whole body of it leans; his holiness for conformity to
him, his power and eternity for the support of faith and hope. The strong and incessant cries of the four
Casts, representing that christian church, are “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come” (Rev. 4:8). Though his power is intimated, yet the chiefest are his holiness, three times
expressed; and his eternity which is repeated, “who lives forever and ever” (ver. 9). This ought to be the
constant practice in the church of the Gentiles, which this book chiefly respects; the meditation of his
converting grace manifested to Paul, ravished the apostle’s heart; but not without the triumphant
consideration of his immortality and eternity, which are the principal parts of the doxology: “Now unto
the King eternal, immortal., invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever” (1 Tim.
1:15, 17). It could be no great transport to the spirit, to consider him glorious without considering him
immortal. The unconfinedness of his perfections in regard of time, presents the soul with matter of the
greatest complacency. The happiness of our souls depends upon his other attributes, but the perpetuity of
it upon his eternity. Is it a comfort to view his immense wisdom; his overflowing goodness; his tender
mercy; his unerring truth? What comfort were there in any of those, if it were a wisdom that could be
baffled; a goodness that could be damped; a mercy that can expire; and a truth that can perish with the
subject of it? Without eternity, what were all his other perfections, but as glorious, yet withering flowers;
a great, but a decaying beauty? By a frequent meditation of God’s eternity, we should become more
sensible of our own vanity and the world’s triflingness; how nothing should ourselves; how nothing
would all other things appear in our eyes! how coldly should we desire them! how feebly should we place
any trust in them! Should we not think ourselves worthy of contempt to dote upon a perishing glory, to
expect support from an arm of flesh, when there is an eternal beauty. to ravish us, an eternal arm to
protect us? Asaph, when he considered God “a portion forever,” thought nothing of the glories of the
earth, or the beauties of the created heavens, worth his appetite or complacency, but “God” (Psalm 73:25,
26). Besides, an elevated frame of heart at the consideration of God’s eternity, would batter down the
strongholds and engines of any temptation: a slight temptation will not know where to find and catch hold
of a soul high and hid in a meditation of it; and if it doth, there will not be wanting from hence
preservatives to resist and conquer it. What transitory pleasures will not the thoughts of God’s eternity
stifle? When this work busieth a soul, it is too great to suffer it to descend, to listen to a sleeveless errand
from hell or the world. The wanton allurements of the flesh will be put off with indignation. The proffers
of the world will be ridiculous when they are cast into the balance with the eternity of God, which sticking
in our thoughts, we shall not be so easy a prey for the fowler’s gin. Let us, therefore, often meditate upon
this, but not in a bare speculation, without engaging our affections, and making every notion of the divine
eternity end in a suitable impression upon our hearts. This would be much like the disciples gazing upon
the heavens at the ascension of their Master, while they forgot the practice of his orders (Acts 1:11). We
may else find something of the nature of God, and lose ourselves, not only in eternity, but to eternity.
</p>
<p>
    2. And hence the second part of the exhortation is, to something which concerns us with a respect to
God.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) If God be eternal, how worthy is he of our choicest affections, and strongest desires of
communion with him! Is not everything to be valued according to the greatness of its being! How, then,
should we love him, who is not only lovely in his nature, but eternally lovely; having from everlasting all
those perfections centered in himself, which appear in time! If everything be lovely, by how much more it
partakes of the nature of God, who is the chief good; how much more infinitely lovely is God, who is
superior to all other goods, and eternally so! Not a God of a few minutes, months, years, or millions of
years; not of the dregs of time or the top of time, but of eternity; above time, inconceivably immense
beyond time. The loving him infinitely, perpetually, is an act of homage due to him for his eternal
excellency; we may give him the one, since our souls are immortal, though we cannot the other, because
they are finite. Since he incloseth in himself all the excellencies of heaven and earth forever, he should
have an affection, not only of time in this world, but of eternity in future; and if we did not owe him a
love for what we are by him, we owe him a love for what he is in himself; and more for what he is, than
for what he is to us. He is more worthy of our affections because he is the eternal God, than because he is
our Creator; because he is more excellent in his nature, than in his transient actions; the beams of his
goodness to us, are to direct our thoughts and affections to him; but his own eternal excellency ought to
be the ground and foundation of our affections to him. And truly, since nothing but God is eternal,
nothing but God is worth the loving; and we do but a just right to our love, to pitch it upon that which can
always possess us and be possessed by us; upon an object that cannot deceive our affection, and put it out
of countenance by a dissolution. And if our happiness consists in being like to God, we should imitate
him in loving him as he loves himself, and as long as he loves himself; God cannot do more to himself
than love himself; he can make no addition to his essence, nor diminution from it. What should we do less
to an eternal Being, than to bestow affections upon him, like his own to himself; since we can find
nothing so durable as himself, for which we should love it?
</p>
<p>
    (2.) He only is worthy of our best service. The Ancient of Days is to be serve before all that are
younger than himself; our best obedience is due to him as a God of unconfined excellency; everything
that is excellent deserves a veneration suitable to its excellency. As God is infinite, he hath right to a
boundless service; as he is eternal, he hath right to a perpetual service: as service is a debt of justice upon
the account of the excellency of his nature, so a perpetual service is as much a debt of justice upon the
account of his eternity. If God be infinite and eternal, he merits an honor and comportment from his
creatures, suited to the unlimited perfection of his nature, and the duration of his being. How worthy is the
Psalmist’s resolution! “I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I
have any being” (Psalm 104:33). It is the use he makes of the endless duration of the glory of God; and
will extend to all other service as well as praise. To serve other things, or to serve ourselves, is too vast a
service upon that which is nothing. In devoting ourselves to God, we serve him that is, that was, so as that
he never began; is to come, so as that he never shall end; by whom all things are what they are; who hath
both eternal knowledge to remember our service, and eternal goodness to reward it.

<h1 class="caption"> DISCOURSE VI - ON THE IMMUTABILITY OF GOD</h1>

<blockquote>
—They shall perish but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old as a garment;
as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed But thou art the same, and thy years shall
have no end.
<div class="sig">PSALM 102:26, 27</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
    THIS Psalm contains a complaint of a people pressed with a great calamity; some think of the Jewish
church in Babylon; others think the Psalmist doth here personate mankind lying under a state of
corruption, because he wishes for the coming of the Messiah, to accomplish that redemption promised by
God, and needed by them. Indeed the title of the Psalm is “A prayer of the afflicted when he is
overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before the Lord;” whether afflicted with the sense of
corruption, or with the sense of oppression. And the redemption by the Messiah, which the ancient church
looked upon as the fountain of their deliverance from a sinful or a servile bondage, is in this psalm spoken
of. A set time appointed for the discovery of his mercy to Sion (ver. 13); an appearance in glory to build
up Sion (ver. 16); the loosing of the prisoner by redemption, and them that are appointed to death (ver.
17); the calling of the Gentiles (ver. 22); and the latter part of the psalm, wherein are the verses I have
read, are applied to Christ (Heb. 1.) Whatsoever the design of the psalm might be, many things are
intermingled that concern the kingdom of the Messiah, and redemption by Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Some make three parts of the psalm. 1. A petition plainly delivered (ver. 1, 2): “Hear my prayer, O
Lord, and let my cry come unto thee,” &amp;c. 2. The petition strongly and argumentatively enforced and
pleaded (ver. 3), from the misery of the petitioner in himself, and his reproach from his enemies. 3. An
acting of faith in the expectation of an answer in the general redemption promised (ver. 12, 13): “But
thou, O Lord, shaft endure forever; thou shalt arise and the mercy upon Sion; the heathen shall fear thy
name.” The first part is the petition pleaded; the second part is the petition answered, in an assurance that
there should in time be a full deliverance.579 The design of the penman is to confirm the church in the
truth of the divine promises; that though the foundations of the world should be ripped up, and the leavens
clatter together, and the whole fabric of them be unpinned and fall to pieces, the firmest parts of it
dissolved; yet the church should continue in its stability, because it stands not upon the changeableness of
creatures, but is built upon the immutable rock of the truth of God, which is as little subject to change, as
his essence.
</p>
<p>
    They shall perish, thou shalt change them. As he had before ascribed to God the “foundation of
heaven and earth” (ver. 25), so he ascribes to God here the destruction of them. Both the beginning and
end of the world are here ascertained. There is nothing, indeed, from the present appearance of things, that
can demonstrate the cessation of the world. The heaven and earth stand firm; the motions of the heavenly
bodies are the same, their beauty is not decayed; individuals corrupt, but the species and kinds remain.
The successions of the year observe their due order; but the sin of man renders the change of the present
appearance of the world necessary to accomplish the design of God for the glory of his elect. The heavens
do not naturally perish, as some fancied an old age of the world, wherein it must necessarily decay as the
bodies of animals do; or that the parts of the heavens are broken off by their rubbing one against another
in their motion, and falling to the earth, are the seeds of those things that grow among us.580
</p>
<p>
    The earth and heavens. He names here the most stable parts of the world, and the most beautiful parts
of the creation; those that are freest from corruptibility and change, to illustrate thereby the immutability
of God; that though the heavens and earth have a prerogative of fixedness above other parts of the world,
and the creatures that reside below, the heavens remain the same as they were created, and the centre of
the earth retains its fixedness, and are as beautiful and fresh in their age as they were in their youth many
years ago, notwithstanding the change of the elements, fire and water being often turned into air, so that
there may remain but little of that air which was first created by reason of the continual transmutation; yet
this firmness of the earth and heavens is not to be regarded in comparison of the unmovableness and
fixedness of the being of God; as their beauty comes short of the glory of his being, so doth their firmness
come short of his stability. Some, by heavens and earth, understand the creatures which reside in the
earth, and those which are in the air, which is called heaven often in Scripture; but the ruin and fall of
these being seen every day, had been no fit illustration of the unchangeableness of God.
</p>
<p>
     They shall perish, they shall be changed. 1. They may perish, say some; they have it not from
themselves that they do not perish, but from thee, who didst endue them with an incorruptible nature; they
shall perish if thou speakest the word; thou canst with as much ease destroy them, as thou didst create
them. But the Psalmist speaks not of their possibility, but the certainty of their perishing. 2. They shall
perish in their qualities and motion, not in their substance, say others. They shall cease from that motion
which is designed properly for the generation and corruption of things in the earth; but in regard of their
substance and beauty they shall remain. As when the strings or wheels of a clock or watch are taken off,
the material parts remain, though the motion of it, and the use for discovering the time of the day,
ceaseth.581 To perish, doth not signify alway a falling into nothing, an annihilation, by which both the
matter and the form are destroyed, but a ceasing of the present appearance of them; a ceasing to be what
they now are; as a man is said to perish when he dies, whereas the better part of man doth not cease to be.
The figure of the body moulders away, and the matter of it returns to dust; but the soul being immortal
ceaseth not to act, when the body, by reason of the absence of the soul, is incapable of acting. So the
heavens shall perish; the appearance they now have shall vanish, and a more glorious and incorruptible
frame be erected by the power and goodness of God. The dissolution of heaven and earth is meant by the
word perish; the raising a new frame is signified by the word changed: as if the Spirit of God would
prevent any wrong meaning of the word perish, by alleviating the sense of that, by another which signifies
only a mutation and change; as when we change a habit and garment, we quit the old to receive the new.
</p>
<p>
     As a garment, as a vesture. Thou shalt change them, ἐλίξεις,582 thou shalt fold them up. The heavens
are compared to a curtain (Psalm 104:2), and shall in due time be folded up as clothes and curtains are. As
a garment encompasseth the whole body, so do the heavens encircle the earth.583 Some say, as a garment
is folded up to be laid aside, that when there is need it may be taken again for use; so shalt thou fold up
the heavens like a garment, that when they are repaired, thou mayest again stretch them out about the
earth; thou shalt fold them up, so that what did appear shall not now appear. It may be illustrated by the
metaphor of a scroll or book, which the Spirit of God useth (Isa. 34:4; Rev. 6:14): “The heavens departed
as a scroll when it is rolled together.” When a book is rolled up or shut, nothing can be read in it till it be
opened again; so the face of the heavens, wherein the stars are as letters declaring the glory of God, shall
be shut or rolled together, so that nothing shall appear, till by its renovation it be opened again: as a
garment it shall be changed, not to be used in the same fashion, and for the same use again. It seems,
indeed, to be for the worse; an old garment is not changed but into rags, to be put to other uses, and
afterwards thrown upon the dunghill; but similitudes are not to be pressed too far; and this will not agree
with the new heavens and new earth, physically so, as well as metaphorically so. It is not likely the
heavens will be put to a worse use than God designed them for in creation; however, a change as a
garment, speaks not a total corruption, but an alteration of qualities; as a garment not to be used in the
same fashion as before. We may observe, that it is probable the world shall not be annihilated, but refined.
It shall lose its present form and fashion; but not its foundation: indeed, as God raised it from nothing, so
he can reduce it into nothing; yet it doth not appear that God will annihilate it, and utterly destroy both the
matter and form of it; part shall be consumed, and part purified (2 Pet. 3:12, 13): “The heavens shall be on
fire and dissolved; nevertheless, we, according to his romise, look for a new heaven and a new earth.”
They shall be melted down as gold by the artificer, to be refined from its dross, and wrought into a more
beautiful fashion, that they may serve the design of God for those that shall reside therein; a new world
wherein righteousness shall dwell: the apostle opposing it thereby to the old world wherein wickedness
did reside. The heavens are to be purged, as the vessels that held the sin-offering were to be purified by
the fire of the sanctuary. God, indeed, will take down this scaffold, which he hath built to publish his
glory. As every individual hath a certain term of its duration, so an end is appointed for the universal
nature of heaven and earth (Isa. 51:6): “The heavens shall vanish like smoke” which disappears. As
smoke is resolved and attenuated into air, not annihilated, so shall the world assume a new face, and have
a greater clearness and splendor; as the bodies of men, dissolved into dust, shall have more glorious
qualities at their resurrection; as a vessel of gold is melted down to remove the batterings in it, and receive
a more comely form by the skill of the workman.
</p>
<p>
    1. The world was not destroyed by the deluge: it was rather washed by water, than consumed; so it
shall be rather refined by the last fire, than lie under an irrecoverable ruin.
</p>
<p>
    2. It is not likely God would liken the everlastingness of his covenant, and the perpetuity of his
spiritual Israel, to the duration of the ordinances of the heavens (as he doth in Jer. 31:35, 36), if they were
wholly to depart from before him. Though that place may only tend to an assurance of a church in the
world, while the world endures; yet it would be but small comfort, if the happiness of believers should
endure no longer than the heavens and earth, if they were to have a total period.
</p>
<p>
    3. Besides, the bodies of the saints must have place for their support to move in, and glorious objects
suited to those glorious senses which shall be restored to them; not in any carnal way, which our Saviour
rejects, when he saith, There is no eating, or drinking, or marrying, &amp;c. in the other world; but whereby
they may glorify God; though how or in what manner their senses shall be used, would be rashness to
determine; only something is necessary for the corporeal state of men, that there may be an employment
for their senses as well as their souls.
</p>
<p>
    4. Again, How could the creature, the world, or any part of it, be said to be delivered from the
bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, if the whole frame of heaven and earth
were to be annihilated (Rom. 8:21)? The apostle saith also, that the creature waits with an “earnest
expectation for this manifestation of the sons of God” (ver. 19); which would have no foundation if the
whole frame should be reduced to nothing. What joyful expectation can there be in any of a total ruin?
How should the creature be capable of partaking in this glorious liberty of the sons of God?e As the world
for the sin of man lost its first dignity, and was cursed alter the fall, and the beauty bestowed upon it by
creation defaced; so it shall recover that ancient glory, when he shall be fully restored by the resurrection
to that dignity he lost by his first sin.
</p>
<p>
    As man shall be freed from his corruptibility to receive that glory which is prepared for him, so shall
the creatures be freed from that imperfection or corruptibility, those stains and spots upon the face of
them, to receive a new glory suited to their nature, and answerable to the design of God, when the
glorious liberty of the saints shall be accomplished.584 As when a prince’s nuptials are solemnized, the
whole country echoes with joy; so the inanimate creatures, when the time of the marriage of the Lamb is
come, shall have a delight and pleasure from that renovation. The apostle sets forth the whole world as a
person groaning; and the Scripture is frequent in such metaphors; as when the creatures are said to wait
upon God, and to be troubled, the hills are said to leap and the mountains to rejoice (Psalm 104:27–29);
the creature is said to groan, as the heavens are said to declare the glory of God, passively, naturally, not
rationally. It is not likely angels are here meant, though they cannot but desire it; since they are affected
with the dishonor and reproach God hath in the world, they cannot but long for the restoration of his
honor in the restoration of the creature to its true end: and, indeed, the angels are employed to serve man
in this sinful state, and cannot but in holiness wish the creature freed from his corruption. Nor is it meant
of the new creatures, which have the first fruits of the Spirit; those he brings in afterwards, groaning and
waiting for the adoption (ver. 23); where he distinguisheth the rational creature from the creature he had
spoken of before. If he had meant the believing creature by that creature that desired the liberty of the
sons of God, what need had there been of that additional distinction, and not only they, but we also who
have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves? Whereby it seems he means some creatures
below rational creatures, since neither angels nor blessed souls can be said to travail in pain, with that
distress as a woman in travail hath, as the word signifies, who perform the work joyfully which God sets
them upon.585 If the creatures be subject to vanity by the sin of man, they shall also partake of a happiness
by the restoration of man. The earth hath borne thorns and thistles, and venomous beasts; the air hath had
its tempests and infectious qualities; the water hath caused its floods and deluges. The creature hath been
abused to luxury and intemperance; and been tyrannized over by man, contrary to the end of its creation.
It is convenient that some time should be allotted for the creature’s attaining its true end, and that it may
partake of the peace of man, as it hath done of the fruits of his sin; otherwise it would seem, that sin had
prevailed more than grace, and would have had more power to deface, than grace to restore things into
their due order.
</p>
<p>
     5. Again, Upon what account should the Psalmist exhort the heavens to rejoice, and the earth to be
glad, when God “comes to judge the world with righteousness” (Psalm 96:11–13), if they should be
annihilated and sunk forever into nothing? “It would seem,” saith Daille,“to be an impertinent figure, if
the Judge of the world brought to them a total destruction; an entire ruin could not be matter of triumph to
creatures, who naturally have that instinct or inclination put into them by their Creator, to preserve
themselves, and to effect their own preservation.”
</p>
<p>
     6. Again, the Lord is to rejoice in his works (Psalm 104:31): “The glory of the Lord shall endure
forever; the Lord shall rejoice in his works;” not hath, but shall rejoice in his works: in the works of
creation, which the Psalmist had enumerated, and which is the whole scope of the Psalm: and he intimates
that it is part of the glory of the Lord which endures forever; that is, his manifestative glory, to rejoice in
his works: the glory of the Lord must be understood with reference to the creation he had spoken of
before. How short was that joy God had in his works after he had sent them beautified out of his hand!
How soon did he repent, not only that he had made man, but was grieved at the heart also, that he made
the other creatures which man’s sin had disordered! (Gen. 6:7.) What joy can God have in them, since the
curse upon the entrance of sin into the world remains upon them? If they are to be annihilated upon the
full restoration of his holiness, what time will God have to rejoice in the other works of creation? It is the
joy of God to see all his works in due order; every one pointing to their true end; marching together in
their excellency, according to his first intendment in their creation. Did God create the world to perform
its end only for one day; scarce so much, if Adam fell the very first day of his creation? What would have
been their end, if Adam had been confirmed in a state of happiness as the angels were? ’tis likely will be
answered and performed upon the complete restoration of man to that happy state from whence he fell.
What artificer compiles a work by his skill, but to rejoice in it? And shall God have no joy from the works
of his hands? Since God can only rejoice in goodness, the creatures must have that goodness restore to
them which God pronounced them to have at the first creation, and which he ordained them for, before he
can again rejoice in his works. The goodness of the creatures is the glory and joy of God.
</p>
<p>
     Inference 1. We may infer from hence, what a base and vile thing sin is, which lays the foundation of
the world’s change. Sin brings it to a decrepit age; sin overturned the whole work of God (Gen. 3:17); so
that to render it useful to its proper end, there is a necessity of a kind of a new creating it. This causes God
to fire the earth for a purification of it from that infection and contagion brought upon it by the apostasy
and corruption of man. It hath served sinful man, and therefore must undergo a purging flame, to be fit to
serve the holy and righteous Creator. As sin is so riveted in the body of man, that there is need of a change
by death to raze it out; so hath the curse for sin got so deep into the bowels of the world, that there is need
of a change by fire to refine it for its master’s use. Let us look upon sin with no other notion than as the
object of God’s hatred, the cause of his grief in the creatures, and the spring of the pain and ruin of the
world.
</p>
<p>
     2. How foolish a thing is it to set our hearts upon that which shall perish, and be no more what it is
now! The heavens and the earth, the solidest and firmest parts of the creation, shall not continue in the
posture they are; they must perish and undergo a refining change. How feeble and weak are the other parts
of the creation, the little creatures walking upon and fluttering about the world, that are perishing and
dying every day; and we scarce see them clothed with life and beauty this day, but they wither and are
despoiled of all the next; and are such frail things fit objects for our everlasting spirits and affections?
Though the dail employment of the heavens is the declaration of the glory of God (Psalm 19:1), yet
neither this, nor their harmony, order, beauty, amazing greatness and glory of them, shall preserve them
from a dissolution and melting at the presence of the Lord. Though they have remained in the same
posture from the creation till this day, and are of so great antiqcity, yet they must bow down to a change
before the will and word of their Creator; and shall we rest upon that which shall vanish like smoke? Shall
we take any creature for our support like ice, that will crack under our feet, and must, by the order of their
Lord Creator, deceive our hopes? Perishing things can be no support to the soul; if we would have rest,
we must run to God and rest in God. How contemptible should that be to us, whose fashion shall pass
away, which shah not endure long in its present form and appearance; contemptible as a rest, not
contemptible as the work of God; contemptible as an end, not contemptible as a means to attain our end!
If these must be changed, how unworthy are other things to be the centre of our souls, that change in our
very using of them, and slide away in our very enjoyment of them!
</p>
<p>
     Thou art the same. The essence of God, with all the perfections of his nature, are pronounced the
same, without any variation from eternity to eternity; so that the text doth not only assert the eternal
duration of God, but his immutability in that duration. His eternity is signified in that expression, “Thou
shalt endure;” his immutability in this, “Thou art the same.” To endure, argues indeed his immutability as
well as eternity; for what endures, is not changed, and what is changed, doth not endure;586 but “Thou art
the same”587 doth more fully signify it. He could not be the same if he could be changed into any other
thing than what he is; the Psalmist therefore puts not thou halt been, or shalt be, but thou art the same,
without any alteration. “Thou art the same;” that is, the same God; the same in essence and nature; the
same in will and purpose. Thou dost change all other things as thou pleanest, but thou art immutable in
every respect, and receivest no shadow of change, though never so light and small. The Psalmist here
alludes to the name Jehovah, I Am;588 and doth not only ascribe immutability to God, but exclude
everything else from partaking in that perfection. All things else are tottering; God sees all other things in
continual motion under his feet, like water passing away and no more seen; while he remains fixed and
immovable; his wisdom and power, his knowledge and will, are always the same. His essence can receive
no alteration, neither by itself, nor by any external cause; whereas other things either naturally decline to
destruction, pass from one term to another, till they come to their period; or shall at the last day be
wrapped up, after God hath completed his will in them and by them, as a man doth a garment he intends
to repair and transform to another use. So that in the text, God, as immutable, is opposed to all creatures
as perishing and changeable.
</p>
<p>
     Doctrine. God is unchangeable in his essence, nature, and perfections. Immutability and eternity are
linked together; and, indeed, true eternity is true immutability; whence eternity is defined the possession
of an immutable life. Yet immutability differs from eternity in our conception; immutability respects the
essence or existence of a thing; eternity respects the duration of a being in that state, or rather,
immutability is the state itself;589 eternity is the measure of that state. A thing is said to be changed, when
it is otherwise now in regard of nature, state, will, or any quality than it was before; when either
something is added to it, or taken from it; when it either loses or acquires. But now it is the essential
property of God, not to have any accession to, or diminution of, his essence or attributes, but to remain
entirely the same. He wants nothing; he loses nothing; but doth uniformly exist by himself, without any
new nature, new thoughts, new will, new purpose, or new place. This unchangeableness of God was
anciently represented by the figure of a cube, a piece of metal or wood framed four-square, when every
side is exactly of the same equality; cast it which way you will, it will always be in the same posture,
because it is equal to itself in all its dimensions.590 He was therefore said to be the centre of all things, and
other things the circumference; the centre is never moved, while the circumference is; it remains
immovable in the midst of the circle; “There is no variableness nor shadow of turning with him” (James
1:17). The moon hath her spots, so hath the sun; there is a mixture of light and darkness; it hath its
changes; sometimes it is in the increase, sometimes in the wane; it is always either gaining or losing, and
by the turnings and motions, either of the heavenly bodies or of the earth, it is in its eclipse, by the
interposition of the earth between that and the sun. The sun also hath its diurnal and annual motion; it
riseth and sets, and puts on a different face; it doth not always shine with the noon-day light; it is
sometimes veiled with clouds and vapors; it is always going from one tropic to another, whereby it makes
various shadows on the earth, and produceth the various seasons of the year; it is not always in our
hemisphere, nor doth it always shine with an equal force and brightness in it. Such shadows and variations
have no place in the eternal Father of Lights; he hath not the least spot or diminution of brightness;
nothing can cloud him or eclipse him.
</p>
<p>
     For the better understanding this perfection of God, I shall premise three things.
</p>
<p>
     1. The immutability of God is a perfection. Immutability considered in itself, without relation to other
things, is not a perfection. It is the greatest misery and imperfection of the evil angels, that they are
immutable in malice against God; but as God is infinite in essence, infinitely good, wise, holy; so it is a
perfection necessary to his nature, that he should be immutably all this, all excellency, goodness, wisdom,
immutably all that he is; without this he would be an imperfect Being. Are not the angels in heaven, who
are confirmed in a holy and happy state, more perfect than when they were in a possibility of committing
evil and becoming miserable? Are not the saints in heaven, whose wills by grace do unalterably cleave to
God and goodness, more perfect than if they were as Adam in Paradise, capable of losing their felicity, as
well as preserving it? We count a rock, in regard of its stability, more excellent than the dust of the
ground, or a feather that is tossed about with every wind; is it not also the perfection of the body to have a
constant tenor of health, and the glory of a man not to warp aside from what is just and right, by the
persuasions of any temptations?
</p>
<p>
     2. Immutability is a glory belonging to all the attributes of God. It is not a single perfection of the
Divine nature, nor is it limited to particular objects thus and thus disposed. Mercy and justice have their
distinct objects and distinct acts; mercy is conversant about a penitent, justice conversant about an
obstinate sinner. In our notion and conception of the Divine perfections, his perfections are different: the
wisdom of God is not his power, nor his power his holiness, but immutability is the centre wherein they
all unite. There is not one perfection but may be said to be and truly is, immutable; none of them will
appear so glorious without this beam, this sun of immutability, which renders them highly excellent
without the least shadow of imperfection. How cloudy would his blessedness be if it were changeable!
How dim his wisdom, if it might be obscured! How feeble his power, if it were capable to be sickly and
languish! How would mercy lose much of its lustre, if it could change into wrath; and justice much of its
dread, if it could be turned into mercy, while the object of justice remains unfit for mercy, and one that
hath need of mercy continues only fit for the Divine fury! But unchangeableness is a thread that runs
through the whole web; it is the enamel of all the rest; none of them without it could look with a
triumphant aspect. His power is unchangeable: “In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength” (Isa. 26:4).
His mercy and his holiness endure forever: he never could, nor ever can, look upon iniquity (Hab. 1:13).
He is a rock in the righteousness of his ways, the truth of his word, the holiness of his proceedings, and
the rectitude of his nature. All are expressed Deut 32:4): “He is a rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways
are judgment; a God of truth, and without iniquity; just and right is he.” All that we consider in God is
unchangeable; for his essence and his properties are the same, and, therefore, what is necessarily
belonging to the essence of God, belongs also to every perfection of the nature of God; none of them can
receive any addition or diminution. From the unchangeableness of his nature, the apostle (James 1:17)
infers the uncbangeableness of his holiness, and himself (in Mal. 3:6) the unchangeableness of his
counsel.
</p>
<p>
     3. Unchangeableness doth necessarily pertain to the nature of God. It is of the same necessity with the
rectitude of his nature; he can no more be changeable in his essence than he can be unrighteous in his
actions. God is a necessary Being; he is necessarily what he is, and, therefore, is unchangeably what he is.
Mutability belongs to contingency. If any perfection of his nature could be separated from him, he would
cease to be God. What did not possess the whole nature of God, could not have the essence of God; it is
reciprocated with the nature of God. Whatsoever is immutable by nature is God; whatsoever is God is
immutable by nature. Some creatures are immutable by his grace and power. God is holy, happy, wise,
good, by his essence; angels and men are made holy, wise, happy, strong, and good, by qualities and
graces.591 The holiness, happiness, and wisdom of saints and angels, as they had a beginning, so they are
capable of increase and diminution, and of an end also; for their standing is not from themselves, or from
the nature of created strength, holiness, or wisdom, which in themselves are apt to fail, and finally to
decay; but from the stability and confirmation they have by the gift and grace of God. The heaven and
earth shall be changed; and after that renewal and reparation they shall not be changed. Our bodies after
the resurrection shall not be changed, but forever be “made conformable to the glorious body of Christ”
(Phil. 3:21); but this is by the powerful grace of God: so that, indeed, those things may be said afterwards
rather to be unchanged than unchangeable, because they are not so by nature, but by sovereign
dispensation. As creatures have not necessary beings, so they have not necessary immutability. Necessity
of being, and, therefore, immutability of being, belongs by nature only to God; otherwise, if there were
any change in God, he would be sometimes what he was not, and would cease to be what he was, which is
against the nature, and, indeed, against the natural notion of a Deity. Let us see then,
</p>
<p>
     I. In what regards God is immutable. II. Prove that God is immutable. III. That this is proper to God,
and incommunicable to any creature. IV. Some propositions to clear the unchangeableness of God from
anything that seems contrary to it. V. The use.
</p>
<p>
     I. In what respects God is unchangeable.
</p>
<p>
     1. God is unchangeable in his essence. He is unalterably fixed in his being, so that not a particle of it
can be lost from it, not a mite added to it. If a man continue in being as long as Methuselah, nine hundred
and sixty-nine years; yet there is not a day, nay, an hour, wherein there is not some alteration in his
substance. Though no substantial part is wanting, yet there is an addition to him by his food, a diminution
of something by his labor; he is always making some acquisition, or suffering some loss: but in God there
can be no alteration, by the accession of anything to make his substance greater or better, or by diminution
to make it less or worse. He who hath not being from another, cannot but be always what he is: God is the
first Being, an independent Being; he was not produced of himself, or of any other, but by nature always
hath been, and, therefore, cannot by himself, or by any other, be changed from what he is in his own
nature. That which is not may as well assume to itself a being, as he who hath and is all being, have the
least change from what he is. Again, because he is a Spirit, he is not subject to those mutations which are
found in corporeal and bodily natures; because he is an absolutely simple Spirit, not having the least
particle of composition; he is not capable of those changes which may be in created spirits.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) If his essence were mutable, God would not truly be; it could not be truly said by himself, “I Am
that I Am” (Exod. 3:14), if he were such a thing or Being at this time, and a different Being at another
time. Whatsoever is changed properly is not, because it doth not remain to be what it was; that which is
changed was something, is something, and will be something. A being remains to that thing which is
changed; yet though it may be said such a thing is, yet it may be also said such a thing is not, because it is
not what it was in its first being; it is not now what it was, it is now what it was not; it is another thing
than it was, it was another thing than it is; it will be another thing than what it is or was. It is, indeed, a
being, but a different being from what it was before. But if God were changed, it could not be said of him
that he is, but it might also be said of him that he is not; or if he were changeable, or could be changed, it
might be said of him he is, but he will not be what he is; or he may not be what he is, but there will be or
may be some difference in his being, and so God would not be “I Am that I Am;” for though he would not
cease utterly to be, yet he would cease to be what he was before.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) Again: if his essence were mutable, he could not be perfectly blessed, and fully rejoice in himself.
If he changed for the better, he could not have an infinite pleasure in what he was before the change,
because he was not infinitely blessed; and the pleasure of that state could not be of a higher kind than the
state itself, or, at least, the apprehension of a happiness in it. If he changed for the worse, he could not
have a pleasure in it after the change; for according to the diminution of his state would be the decrease of
his pleasure. His pleasure could not be infinite before the change, if he changed for the better; it could not
be infinite after the change, if he changed for the worse. If he changed for the better, he would not have
had an infinite goodness of being before; and not having an infinite goodness of being, he would have a
finite goodness of being; for there is no medium between finite and infinite. Then, though the change
were for the better, yet, being finite before, something would be still wanting to make him infinitely
blessed; because being finite, he could not change to that which is infinite; for finite and infinite are
extremes so distant, that they can never pass into one another; that is, that that which is finite should
become infinite, or that which is infinite should become finite; so that supposing him mutable, his essence
in no state of change could furnish him with an infinite peace and blessedness.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) Again: if God’s essence be changed, he either increaseth or diminisheth.592 Whatsoever is
changed, doth either gain by receiving something larger and greater than it had in itself before, or gains
nothing by being changed. If the former, then it receives more than itself, more than it had in itself before.
The Divine nature cannot be increased; for whatsoever receives anything than what it had in itself before,
must necessarily receive it from another, because nothing can give to itself that which it hath not. But God
cannot receive from another what he hath not already, because whatsoever other things possess is derived
from him, and, therefore, contained in him, as the fountain contains the virtue in itself which it conveys to
the streams; so that God cannot gain anything. If a thing that is changed gain nothing by that change, it
loseth something of what it had before in itself; and this loss must be by itself or some other. God cannot
receive any loss from anything in himself; he cannot will his own diminution, that is repugnant to every
nature. He may as well will his own destruction as his own decrease: every decrease is a partial
destruction. But it is impossible for God to die any kind of death, to have any resemblance of death, for he
is immortal, and “only hath immortality” (1 Tim. 6:16), therefore impossible to be diminished in any
particle of his essence; nor can he be diminished by anything in his own nature, because his infinite
simplicity admits of nothing distinct from himself, or contrary to himself. All decreases come from
something contrary to the nature of that thing which doth decrease. Whatsoever is made less than itself,
was not truly unum, one and simple, because that which divides itself in separation was not the same in
conjunction. Nor can he be diminished by any other without himself; because nothing is superior to God,
nothing stronger than God which can oppress him. But whatsoever is changed is weaker than that which
changeth it, and sinks under a power it cannot successfully resist; weakness belongs not to the Deity.593
Nor, lastly, can God change from a state wherein he is, to another state equal to the former, as men in
some cases may do; for in passing from one state to another equal to it, something must be parted with
which he had before, that some other thing may accrue to him as a recompense for that loss, to make him
equal to what he was. This recompense then he had not before, though he had something equal to it. And
in this case it could not be said by God “I Am that I Am,” but I am equal to what I was; for in this case
there would be a diminution and increase which, as was showed, cannot be in God.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) Again: God is of himself, from no other.594 Natures, which are made by God, may increase,
because they began to be; they may decrease, because they were made of nothing, and so tend to nothing;
the condition of their original leads them to defect, and the power of their Creator brings them to increase.
But God hath no original; he hath no defect, because he was not made of nothing he hath no increase,
because he had no beginning. He was before all things, and, therefore, depends upon no other thing
which, by its own change, can bring any change upon him. That which is from itself cannot be changed,
because it hath nothing before it, nothing more excellent than itself; but that which is from another as its
first cause and chief good, may be changed by that which was its efficient cause and last end.595
</p>
<p>
     2. God is immutable in regard of knowledge. God hath known from all eternity all that which he can
know, so that nothing is hid from him. He knows not at present any more than he hath known from
eternity: and that which he knows now he always knows “All things are open and naked before him”
(Heb. 4:13). A man is said to be changed in regard of knowledge, when he knows that now which he did
not know before, or knows that to be false now which he thought true before, or has something for the
object of his understanding now, which he had not before: But,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) This would be repugnant to the wisdom and omniscience which belongs to the notions of a Deity.
That cannot be God that is not infinitely wise; that cannot be infinitely wise that is either ignorant of, or
mistaken in, his apprehension of any one thing. If God be changed in knowledge, it must be for want of
wisdom; all change of this nature in creatures implies this defect preceding or accompanying it. Such a
thought of God would have been unworthy of him that is “only wise,” that hath no mate for wisdom (1
Tim. 1:17); none wise beside himself. If he knew that thing this day which he knew not before, he would
not be an “only wise” Being; for a being that did know everything at once might be conceived, and so a
wiser being be apprehended by the mind of man. If God understood a thing at one time which he did not
at another, he would be changed from ignorance to knowledge; as if he could not do that this day which
he could do to-morrow, he would be changed from impotence to power. He could not be always
omniscient, because there might be yet something still to come which he yet knows not, though he may
know all things that are past. What way soever you suppose a change, you must suppose a present or a
past ignorance; if he be changed in his knowledge for the perfection of his understanding, he was ignorant
before; if his understanding be impaired by the change, he is ignorant after it.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) If God were changeable in his knowledge, it would make him unfit to be an object of trust to any
rational creature. His revelations would want the due ground for entertainment, if his understanding were
changeable; for that might be revealed as truth now which might prove false hereafter, and that as false
now which hereafter might prove true; and so God would be an unfit object of obedience in regard of his
precepts, and an unfit object of confidence in regard of his promises. For if he be changeable in
knowledge he is defective in knowledge, and might promise that now which he would know afterwards
was unfit to be promised, and, therefore, unfit to be performed. It would make him an incompetent object
of dread, in regard of his threatenings; for he might threaten that now which he might know hereafter
were not fit or just to be inflicted. A changeable mind and understanding cannot make a due and right
judgment of things to be done, and things to be avoided; no wise man would judge it reasonable to trust a
weak and flitting person. God must needs be unchangeable in his knowledge; but, as the schoolmen say,
that, as the sun always shines, so God always knows; as the sun never ceaseth to shine, so God never
ceaseth to know. Nothing can be hid from the vast compass of his understanding, no more than anything
can shelter itself without the verge of his power. This farther appears in that,
</p>
<p>
     1st. God knows by his own essence. He doth not know, as we do, by habits, qualities, species,
whereby we may be mistaken at one time and rectified at another. He hath not an understanding distinct
from his essence as we have, but being the most simple Being, his understanding is his essence; and as
from the infiniteness of his essence we conclude the infiniteness of his understanding, so from the
unchangeableness of his essence, we may justly conclude the unchangeableness of his knowledge. Since,
therefore, God is without all composition, and his understanding is not distinct from his essence, what he
knows, he knows by his essence, and there can then be no more mutability in his knowledge than there
can be in his essence; and if there were any in that, he could not be God, because he would have the
property of a creature. If his understanding then be his essence, his knowledge is as necessary, as
unchangeable as his essence. As his essence eminently contains all perfections in itself, so his
understanding comprehends all things past, present, and future, in itself. If his understanding and his
essence were not one and the same, he were not simple, but compounded: if compounded, he would
consist of parts; if he consisted of parts, he would not be an independent Being, and so would not be God.
</p>
<p>
     2d. God knows all things by one intuitive act. As there is no succession in his being, so that he is one
thing now and another thing hereafter; so there is no succession in his knowledge. He knows things that
are successive, before their existence and succession, by one single act of intuition; by one cast of his eye
all things future are present to him in regard of his eternity and omnipresence; so that though there is a
change and variation in the things known, yet his knowledge of them and their several changes in nature
is invariable and unalterable. As imagine a creature that could see with his eye at one glance the whole
compass of the heavens, by sending out beams from his eye without receiving any species from them, he
would see the whole heavens uniformly, this part now in the east, then in the west, without any change in
his eye, for he sees every part and every motion together; and though that great body varies and whirls
about, and is in continual agitation, his eye remains steadfast, suffers no change, beholds all their motions
at once and by one glance. God knows all things from eternity, and, therefore, perpetually knows them;596
the reason is because the Divine knowledge is infinite,597 and therefore, comprehends all knowable truths
at once. An eternal knowledge comprehends in itself all time, and beholds past and present in the same
manner, and, therefore, his knowledge is immutable: by one simple knowledge he considers the infinite
spaces of past and future.
</p>
<p>
     3d. God’s knowledge and will is the cause of all things and their successions.598 There can be no
pretence of any changeableness of knowledge in God; but in this case, before things come to pass, he
knows that they will come to pass; after they are come to pass, he knows that they are past; and slide
away. This would be something if the succession of things were the cause of the Divine knowledge, as it
is of our knowledge; but on the contrary, the Divine knowledge and will is the cause of the succession of
them: God doth not know creatures because they are; but they are because he knows them: “All his works
were known to him from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18). All his works were not known to him,
if the events of all those works were not also known to him; if they were not known to him, how should
he make them? he could not do anything ignorantly. He made them then after he knew them, and did not
know them after he made them. His knowledge of them made a change in them; their existence made no
change in his knowledge. He knew them when they were to be created, in the same manner that he knew
them after they were created; before they were brought into act, as well as after they were brought into
act; before they were made, they were, and were not; they were in the knowledge of God, when they were
not in their own nature; God did not receive his knowledge from their existence, but his knowledge and
will acted upon them to bring them into being.
</p>
<p>
     4th. Therefore the distinction of past and future makes no change in the knowledge of God. When a
thing is past, God hath no more distinct knowledge of it after it is past, than he had when it was to come;
all things were all in their circumstances of past, present, and to come; seen by his understanding, as they
were determined by his will.599 Besides, to know a day to be past or future, is only to know the state of
that day in itself, and to know its relation to that which follows, and that which went before. This day
wherein we are, if we consider it in the state wherein it was yesterday, it was to come, it was future; but if
we consider it in that state wherein it will be to-morrow, we understand it as past. This in man cannot be
said to be a different knowledge of the thing itself, but only of the circumstance attending a thing, and the
different relation of it. As I see the sun this day, I know it was up yesterday, I know it will be up to-
morrow; my knowledge of the sun is the same; if there be any change, it is in the sun, not in my
knowledge; only I apply my knowledge to such particular circumstances. How much more must the
knowledge of those things in God be unchangeable, who knows all those states, conditions, and
circumstances, most perfectly from eternity; wherein there is no succession, no past or future, and
therefore will know them forever! He always beholds the same thing; he sees, indeed, succession in
things, and he sees a thing to be past which before was future. As from eternity he saw Adam as existing
in such a time; in the first time he saw that he would be, in the following time he saw that he had been;
but this he knew from eternity; this he knew in the same manner; though there was a variation in Adam,
yet there was no variation in God’s knowledge of him, in all his states; though Adam was not present to
himself, yet in all his states he was present to God’s eternity.
</p>
<p>
    5th. Consider, that the knowledge of God, in regard of the manner of it, as well as the objects, is
incomprehensible to a finite creature. So that though we cannot arrive to a full understanding of the
manner of God’s knowledge, yet we must conceive so of it, as to remove all imperfection from him in it.
And since it is an imperfection to be changeable, we must remove that from God; the knowledge of God
about things past, present and future, must be inconceivably above ours: “His understanding is infinite”
(Psalm 147:6). There is no number of it; it can no more be calculated or drawn into an account by us, than
infinite spaces, which have no bounds and limits, can be measured by us. We can no more arrive, even in
heaven, to a comprehensive understanding of the manner of his knowledge, than of the infinite glory of
his essence; we may as well comprehend one as the other. This we must conclude, that God being not a
body, doth not see one thing with eyes, and another thing with mind, as we do; but being a spirit, he sees
and knows only with mind, and his mind is himself, and is as unchangeable as himself; and therefore as
he is not now another thing than what he was, so he knows not anything now in another manner than as he
knew it from eternity; he sees all things in the glass of his own essence; as, therefore, the glass doth not
vary, so neither doth his vision.
</p>
<p>
    3. God is unchangeable in regard of his will and purpose. A change in his purpose is, when a man
determines to do that now which before he determined not to do, or to do the contrary; when a man hates
that thing which he loved, or begins to love that which he before hated; when the will is changed, a man
begins to will that which he willed not before, and ceaseth to will that which he willed before. But
whatsoever God hath decreed, is immutable; whatsoever God hath promised, shall be accomplished: “The
word that goes forth of his mouth shall not return to him void, but it shall accomplish that which he
pleaseth” (Isa. 55:11); whatsoever “he purposeth, he will do” (Isa. 46:11; Num. 23:19); his decrees are
therefore called “mountains of brass” (Zech. 6:1): brass, as having substance and solidity; mountains, as
being immovable, not only by any creature, but by himself; because they stand upon the basis of infallible
wisdom, and are supported by uncontrollable power. From this immutability of his will, published to man,
there could be no release from the severity of the law, without satisfaction made by the death of a
Mediator, since it was the unalterable will of God, that death should be the wages of sin; and from this
immutable will it was, that the length of time, from the first promise of the Redeemer to his mission, and
the daily provocations of men, altered not his purpose for the accomplishment of it in the fulness of that
time he had resolved upon; nor did the wickedness of former ages hinder the addition of several promises
as buttresses to the first. To make this out, consider,
</p>
<p>
    (1.) The will of God is the same with his essence. If God had a will distinct from his essence, he
would not be the most simple Being. God hath not a faculty of will distinct from himself; as his
understanding is nothing else but Deus intelligens, God understanding; so his will is nothing else but Deus
volens, God willing; being, therefore, the essence of God; though it is considered, according to our
weakness, as a faculty, it is as his understanding and wisdom, eternal and immutable; and can no more be
changed than his essence. The immutability of the Divine counsel depends upon that of his essence; he is
the Lord Jehovah, therefore he is true to his word (Mal.3:6; Isa. 43:13): “Yea, before the day I am he, and
there is none that can deliver out of my hand.” He is the same, immutable in his essence, therefore
irresistible in his power.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) There is a concurrence of God’s will and understanding in everything. As his knowledge is
eternal, so is his purpose. Things created had not been known to be, had not God resolved them to be the
act of his will; the existence of anything supposeth an act of his will. Again, as God knows all things by
one simple vision of his understanding, so he wills all things by one act of volition; therefore the purpose
of God in the Seripture is not expressed by counsels in the plural number, but counsel; showing that all
the purposes of God are not various, but as one will, branching itself out into many acts towards the
creature; but all knit in one root, all links of one chain. Whatsoever is eternal is immutable; as his
knowledge is eternal, and therefore immutable, so is his will; he wills or nills nothing to be in time, but
what he willed and nilled from eternity; if he willed in time that to be that he willed not from eternity,
then he would know that in time which he knew not from eternity; for God knows nothing future, but as
his will orders it to be future, and in time to be brought into being.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) There can be no reason for any change in the will of God. When men change in their minds, it
must be for want of foresight; because they could not foresee all the rubs and bars which might suddenly
offer themselves; which if they had foreseen, they would not have taken such measures: hence men often
will that which they afterwards wish they had not willed when they come to understand it clearer, and see
that to be injurious to them which they thought to be good for them; or else the change proceeds from a
natural instability without any just cause, and an easiness to be drawn into that which is unrighteous; or
else it proceeds from a want of power, when men take new counsels, because they are invincibly hindered
from executing the old. But none of those can be in God.
</p>
<p>
    1st. It cannot be for want of foresight. What can be wanting to an infinite understanding? How can any
unknown event defeat his purpose, since nothing happens in the world but what he wills to effect, or wills
to permit; and therefore all future events are present with him? Besides, it doth not consist with God’s
wisdom to resolve anything, but upon the highest reason; and what is the highest and infinite reason,
cannot but be unalterable in itself; for there can be no reason and wisdom higher than the highest. All
God’s purposes are not bare acts of will, but acts of counsel. “He works all things according to the
counsel of his own will” (Eph. 1:11): and he doth not say so much that his will, as that “his counsel shall
stand” (Isa. 46:10). It stands, because it is counsel; and the immutability of a promise is called the
“immutability of his counsel” (Heb. 6:1?), as being introduced and settled by the most perfect wisdom,
and therefore to be carried on to a full and complete execution; his purpose, then, cannot be changed for
want of foresight; for this would be a charge of weakness.
</p>
<p>
    2d. Nor can it proceed from a natural instability of his will, or an easiness to be drawn to that which is
unrighteous. If his will should not adhere to his counsel, it is because it is not fit to be followed, or
because it will not follow it; if not fit to be followed, it is a reflection upon his wisdom; if it be
established, and he will not follow it, there is a contrariety in God, as there is in a fallen creature, will
against wisdom. That cannot be in God which he hates in a creature, viz. the disorder of faculties, and
being out of their due place. The righteousness of God is like a “great mountain” (Psalm 36:6). The
rectitude of his nature is as immovable in itself, as all the mountains in the world are by the strength of
man. “He is not as a man, that he should repent or lie” (Num. 23:19); who often changes, out of a
perversity of will, as well as want of wisdom to foresee, or want of ability to perform. His eternal purpose
must either be righteous or unrighteous; if righteous and holy, he would become unholy by the change; if
not righteous nor holy, then he was unrighteous before the change; which way soever it falls, it would
reflect upon the righteousness of God, which is a blasphemous imagination.600 If God did change his
purpose, it must be either for the better,—then the counsel of God was bad before; or for the worse,—then
he was not wise and good before.
</p>
<p>
     3d. Nor can it be for want of strength. Who hath power to control him? Not all the combined devices
and endeavors of men can make the counsel of God to totter (Prov. 19:21): “There are many devices in a
man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand;” that, and that only shall stand. Man
hath a power to devise and imagine, but no power to effect and execute of himself. God wants no more
power to effect what he will, than he wants understanding to know what is fit. Well, then, since God
wanted not wisdom to frame his decrees, nor holiness to regulate them, nor power to effect them, what
should make him change them? since there can be no reason superior to his, no event unforeseen by him,
no holiness comparable to his, no unrighteousness found in him, no power equal to his, to put a rub in his
way.
</p>
<p>
     4th. Though the will of God be immutable, yet it is not to be understood so, as that the things
themselves so willed are immutable. Nor will the immutability of the things willed by him, follow upon
the unchangeableness of his will in willing them; though God be firm in willing them, yet he doth not will
that they should alway be. God did not perpetually will the doing those things which he once decreed to
be done; he decreed that Christ should suffer, but he did not decree that Christ should alway suffer; so he
willed the Mosaical rites for a time, but he did not will that they should alway continue; he willed that
they should endure only for a time; and when the time came for their ceasing, God had been mutable if he
had not put an end to them, because his will had fixed such a period. So that the changing of those things
which he had once appointed to be practised, is so far from charging God with changeableness, that God
would be mutable if he did not take them away; since he decreed as well their abolition at such a time, as
their continuance till such a time; so that the removal of them was pursuant to his unchangeable will and
decree. If God had decreed that such laws should alway continue, and afterwards changed that decree, and
resolved the abrogation of them, then indeed God had been mutable; he had rescinded one decree by
another; he had then seen an error in his first resolve, and there must be some weakness in the reason and
wisdom whereon it was grounded.601 But it was not so here; for the change of those laws is so far from
slurring God with any mutability, that the very, change of them is no other than the issue of his eternal
decree; for from eternity he purposed in himself to change this or that dispensation, though he did decree
to bring such a dispensation into the world. The decree itself was eternal and immutable, but the thing
decreed was temporary and mutable. As a decree from eternity doth not make the thing decreed to be
eternal, so neither doth the immutability of the decree render the thing so decreed to be immutable: as for
example, God decreed from all eternity to create the world; the eternity of this decree did not make the
world to be in being and actually created from eternity; so God decreed immutably that the world so
created should continue for such a time; the decree is immutable if the world perish at that time, and
would not be immutable if the world did endure beyond that time that God hath fixed for the duration of
it: as when a prince orders a man’s remaining in prison for so many days; if he be prevailed with to give
him a delivery before those days, or to continue him in custody for the same crime after those days, his
order is changed; but if he orders the delivery of him just at that time, till which he had before decreed
that he should continue in prison, the purpose and order of the prince remains firm, and the change in the
state of the prisoner is the fruit of that firm and fixed resolution: so that we must distinguish between the
person decreeing, the decree itself, and the thing decreed. The person decreeing, viz., God, is in himself
immutable, and the decree is immutable; but the thing decreed may be mutable; and if it were not changed
according to the first purpose, it would argue the decree itself to be changed; for while a man wills that
this may be done now, and another thing done afterwards, the same will remains; and though there be a
change in the effects, there is no change in the will.
</p>
<p>
    5th. The immutability of God’s will doth not infringe the liberty of it. The liberty of God’s will
consists with the necessity of continuing his purpose. God is necessarily good, immutably good; yet he is
freely so, and would not be otherwise than what he is. God was free in his first purpose; and purposing
this or that by an infallible and unerring wisdom, it would be a weakness to change the purpose. But,
indeed, the liberty of God’s will doth not seem so much to consist in an indifferericy to this or that, as in
an independency on anything without himself: his will was free, because it did not depend upon the
objects about which his will was conversant. To be immutably good is no point of imperfection, but the
height of perfection.
</p>
<p>
    4. As God is unchangeable in regard of essence, knowledge, purpose, so he is unchangeable in regard
of place. He cannot be changed in time, because he is eternity; so he cannot be changed in place, because
he hath ubiquity: he is eternal, therefore cannot be changed in time; he is omnipresent, therefore cannot be
changed in place he doth not begin to be in one place wherein he was not before, or cease to be in a place
wherein he was before. He that fills every place in heaven and earth, cannot change place; he cannot leave
one to possess another, that is equally, in regard of his essence, in all: “He fills heaven and earth” (Jer.
23:24). The heavens that are not subject to those changes to which sublunary bodies are subject, that are
not diminished in quantity or quality; yet they are alway changing place in regard of their motion; no part
of them doth alway continue in the same point: but God hath no change of his nature, because he is most
inward in everything; he is substantially in all spaces, real and imaginary; there is no part of the world
which he doth not fill; no place can be imagined wherein he doth not exist. Suppose a million of worlds
above and about this, encircling one another; his essence would be in every part and point of those
worlds; because it is indivisible, it cannot be divided; nor can it be contained within those created limits of
millions of worlds, when the most soaring and best coining fancy hath run through all creatures to the
highest sphere of the heavens, and imagined one world after another, till it can fancy no more: none of
these, nor all of these, can contain God; for the “heaven of heavens cannot contain him” (1 Kings 8:27);
“He is higher than heaven, deeper than hell” (Job 11:8), and possesses infinite imaginary spaces beyond
created limits. He who hath no cause of being, can have no limits of being;602 and though by creation he
began to be in the world, yet he did not begin to be where the world is, but was in the same imaginary
space from all eternity; for he was alway in himself by his own eternal ubi. Therefore observe, that when
God is said to draw near to us when we draw near to him (James 4:8), it is not by local motion or change
of place, but by special and spiritual influences, by exciting and supporting grace. As we ordinarily say,
the sun is come into the house when yet it remains in its place and order in the heavens, because the
beams pierce through the windows and enlighten the room, so when God is said to come down or descend
(Gen. 11:5; Exod. 34:5), it is not by a change of place, but a change of outward acts, when he puts forth
himself in ways of fresh mercy or new judgments, in the effluxes of his love or the flames of his wrath.
When good men feel the warm beams of his grace refreshing them, or wicked men feel the hot coals of
his anger scorching them. God’s drawing near to us is not so much his coming to us, but his drawing us to
him;603 as when watermen pull a rope that is in one end fastened to the shore, and the other end to the
vessel; the shore is immovable, yet it seems to the eye to come to them, but they really move to the shore.
God is an immovable rock; we are floating and uncertain creatures; while he seems to approach to us, he
doth really make us to approach to him; he comes not to us by any change of place himself, but draws us
to him by a change of mind, will, and affections in us.
</p>
<p>
    II. The second thing propounded, is the reasons to prove God immutable. The heathens acknowledged
God to be so: Plato604 and the Pythagoreans called God, or the stable good principle, ἀυιὸν, idem: the evil
principle, ἓτερον, another thing, changeable; one thing one time, and another thing another time605 (Dan.
6:26): “He is the living God, and steadfast forever.”
</p>
<p>
     1. The name Jehovah signifies this attribute (Exod. 3:14): “I am that I am; I am hath sent me to you.”
It signifies his immutability as well as eternity. I am, signifies his eternity; that, or the same that I am, his
immutability:606 as it respects the essence of God, it signifies his unchangeable being from eternity to
eternity; as it respects the creature, it signifies his constancy in his counsels and promises, which spring
from no other cause but the unchangeableness of his nature.607 The reason why men stand not to their
covenant, is because they are not always the same; I am, that is, I am the same, before the creation of the
world, and since the creation of the world; before the entrance of sin, and since the entrance of sin; before
their going into Egypt, and while they remain in Egypt. The very name Jehovah608 bears, according to the
grammatical order, a mark of God’s unchangeableness; it never hath anything added to it nor anything
taken from it; it hath no plural number, no affixes—a custom peculiar to the eastern languages; it never
changes its letters as other words do. That only is a true being which hath not only an eternal existence,
but stability in it: that is not truly a being, that never remains in the same state.609 All things that are
changed cease to be what they were, and begin to be what they were not, and therefore cannot have the
title truly applied to them, they are; they are, indeed, but like a river in a continual flux, that no man ever
sees the same; let his eye be fixed upon one place of it, the water he sees, slides away, and that which he
saw not succeeds in its place; let him take his eye off but for the least moment, and fix it there again, and
he sees not the same that he saw before. All sensible things are in a perpetual stream; that which is
sometimes this and sometimes that, is not, because it is not always the same; whatsoever is changed, is
something now which it was not alway; but of God it is said, I am, which could not be if he were
changeable; for it may be said of him, he is not, as well as be is, because he is not what he was; if we say
not of him, he was, nor he will be, but only he is, whence should any change arrive? He must invincibly
remain the same, of whose nature, perfections, knowledge and will, it cannot be said it was, as if it were
not now in him; or it shall be, as if it were not yet in him; but he is, because he doth not only exist, but
doth alway exist the same. I am, that is, I receive from no other what I am in myself; he depends upon no
other in his essence, knowledge, purposes, and therefore hath no changing power over him.
</p>
<p>
     2. If God were changeable, he could not be the most perfect Being. God is the most perfect Being, and
possesses in himself infinite and essential goodness (Matt. 5:48): “Your heavenly Father is perfect.” If he
could change from that perfection, he were not the highest exemplar and copy for us to write after. If God
doth change, it must be either to a greater perfection than he had before, or to a less, mutatio perfectiva vel
amissiva; if he changes to acquire a perfection he had not, then he was not before the most excellent
being; necessarily, he was not what he might be; there was a defect in him, and a privation of that which
is better than what he had and was; and then he was not alway the best, and so was not alway God; and
being not alway God, could never be God; for to begin to be God is against the notion of God; not to a
less perfection than he had; that were to change to imperfection, and to lose a perfection which he
possessed before, and cease to be the best Being; for he would lose some good which he had, and acquire
some evil which he was free from before. So that the sovereign perfection of God is an invincible bar to
any change in him; for which way soever you cast it for a change, his supreme excellency is impaired and
nulled by it: for in all change there is something from which a thing is changed, and something to which it
is changed; so that on the one part there is a loss of what it had, and on the other part there is an
acquisition of what it had not. If to the better, he was not perfect, and so was not God; if to the worse, he
will not be perfect, and so be no longer God after that change. If God be changed, his change must be
voluntary or necessary; if voluntary, he then intends the change for the better, and chose it to acquire a
perfection by it; the will must be carried out to anything under the notion of some goodness in that which
it desires. Since good is the object of the desire and will of the creature, evil cannot be the object of the
desire and will of the Creator. And if he should be changed for the worse, when he did really intend the
better, it would speak a defect of wisdom, and a mistake of that for good which was evil and imperfect in
itself; and if it be for the better, it must be a motion or change for something without himself; that which
he desireth is not possessed by himself, but by some other. There is, then, some good without him and
above him, which is the end in this change; for nothing acts but for some end, and that end is within itself
or without itself; if the end for which God changes be without himself, then there is something better than
himself: besides, if he were voluntarily changed for the better, why did he not change before? If it were
for want of power, he bad the imperfection of weakness; if for want of knowledge of what was the best
good, he had the imperfection of wisdom, he was ignorant of his own happiness; if he had both wisdom to
know it, and power to effect it, it must be for want of will; he then wanted that love to himself and his
own glory, which is necessary in the Supreme Being. Voluntarily he could not be changed for the worse,
he could not be such an enemy to his own glory; there is nothing but would hinder its own imperfection
and becoming worse. Necessarily he could not be changed, for that necessity must arise from himself, and
then the difficulties spoken of before will recur, or it must arise from another; he cannot be bettered by
another, because nothing hath any good but what it hath received from the hands of his bounty, and that
without loss to himself, nor made worse; if anything made him worse, it would be sin, but that cannot
touch his essence or obscure his glory, but in the design and nature of the sin itself (Job 35:6, 7): “If thou
sinnest, what dost thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what dost thou unto him? if
thou be righteous, what givest thou him; or what receives he at thy hand?” He hath no addition by the
service of man, no more than the sun hath of light by a multitude of torches kindled on the earth; nor any
more impair bx the sins of men, than the light of the sun hath by men’s shooting arrows against it.
</p>
<p>
    3. God were not the most simple being if he were not immutable.610 There is in everything that is
mutable a composition either essential or accidental; and in all changes, something of the thing changed
remains, and something of it ceaseth and is done away; as for example, in an accidental change, if a white
wall be made black, it loses its white color; but the wall itself, which was the subject of that color,
remains and loses nothing of its substance: likewise in a substantial change, as when wood is burnt, the
substantial part of wood is lost, the earthly part is changed into ashes, the airy part ascends in smoke, the
watery part is changed into air by the fire: there is not an annihilation of it, but a resolution of it into those
parts whereof it was compounded; and this change doth evidence that it was compounded of several parts
distinct from one another. If there were any change in God, it is by separating something from him, or
adding something to him; if by separating something from him, then he was compounded of something
distinct from himself; for if it were not distinct from himself it could not be separated from him without
loss of his being; if by adding anything to him, then it is a compounding of him, either substantially or
accidentally. Mutability is absolutely inconsistent with simplicity, whether the change come from an
internal or external principle. If a change be wrought by something without, it supposeth either contrary or
various parts in the thing so changed, whereof it doth consist; if it be wrought by anything within, it
supposeth that the thing so changed doth consist of one part that doth change it, and another part that is
changed, and so it would not be a simple being. If God could be changed by anything within himself, all
in God would not be God; his essence would depend upon some parts, whereof some would be superior to
others; if one part were able to change or destroy another, that which doth change would be God, that
which is changed would not be God; so God would be made up of a Deity and a non-Deity, and part of
God would depend upon God; part would be dependent, and part would be independent; part would be
mutable, part immutable: so that mutability is against the notion of God’s independency as well as his
simplicity. God is the most simple being; for that which is first in nature, having nothing beyond it, cannot
by any means be thought to be compounded; for whatsoever is so, depends upon the parts whereof it is
compounded, and so is not the first being: now God being infinitely simple, hath nothing in himself which
is not himself, and therefore cannot will any change in himself, he being his own essence and existence.611
</p>
<p>
    4. God were not eternal if he were mutable. In all change there is something that perishes, either
substantially or accidentally. All change is a kind of death, or imitation of death; that which was dies, and
begins to be what it was not. The soul of man, though it ceaseth not to be and exist, yet when it ceaseth to
be in quality what it was, is said to die. Adam died when he changed from integrity to corruption, though
both his soul and body were in being (Gen. 2:17); and the soul of a regenerate man is said to “die to sin,”
when it is changed from sin to grace (Rom. 6:11). In all change there is a resemblance of death; so the
notion of mutability is against the eternity of God. If anything be acquired by a change, then that which is
acquired was not from eternity, and so he was not wholly eternal; if anything be lost which was from
eternity, he is not wholly everlasting; if he did decrease by the change, something in him which had no
beginning would have an end; if he did increase by that change, something in him would have a beginning
that might have no end. What is changed doth not remain, and what doth not remain is not eternal.612
Though God alway remains in regard of existence, he would be immortal, and live alway; yet if he should
suffer any change, he could not properly be eternal, because he would not alway be the same, and would
not in every part be eternal; for all change is finished in time, one moment precedin, another moment
following; but that which is before time cannot be changed by time. God cannot be eternally what he was;
that is, he cannot have a true eternity, if he had a new knowledge, a new purpose, a new essence; if he
were sometimes this and sometimes that, sometimes know this and sometimes know that, sometimes
purpose this and afterwards hath a new purpose; he would be partly temporary and partly eternal, not truly
and universally eternal. He that hath anything of newness, hath not properly and truly an entire eternity.
Again, by the same reason that God could in the least cease to be what he was, he might also cease wholly
to be; and no reason can be rendered why God might not cease wholly to be, as well as cease to be
entirely and uniformly what he was. All changeableness implies a corruptibility.
</p>
<p>
     5. If God were changeable, he were not infinite and almighty. All change ends in addition or
diminution; if anything be added, he was not infinite before, if anything be diminished, he is not infinite
after. All change implies bounds and limits to that which is changed; but God is infinite; “His greatness is
unsearchable:”613 we can add number to number without any end, and can conceive an infinite number;
yet the greatness of God is beyond all our conceptions. But if there could be any change in his greatness
for the better, it would not be unsearchable before that change; if for the worse, it would not be
unsearchable after that change. Whatsoever hath limits and is changeable, is conceivable and searchable;
but God is not only not known, but impossible in his own nature to be known and searched out, and,
therefore, impossible to have any diminution in his nature. All that which is changed arrives to something
which it was not before, or ceaseth in part to be what it was before. He would not also be almighty. What
is omnipotent cannot be made worse; for to be made worse, is in part to be ccrrupted. If he be made better,
he was not almighty before; something of power was wanting to him. If there should be any change, it
must proceed from himself or from another; if from himself, it would be an inability to preserve himself
in the perfection of his nature; if from another, he would be inferior in strength, knowledge, and power, to
that which changes him, either in his nature, knowledge, or will; in both an inability; an inability in him to
continue the same, or an inability in him to resist the power of another.
</p>
<p>
     6. The world could not be ordered and governed but by some Principle or Being which were
immutable. Principles are alway more fixed and stable than things which proceed from those principles;
and this is true both in morals and naturals. Principles in conscience, whereby men are governed, remain
firmly engraven in their minds. The root lies firmly in the earth, while branches are shaken with the wind.
The heavens, the cause of generation, are more firm and stable than those things which are wrought by
their influence. All things in the world are moved by some power and virtue which is stable; and unless it
were so, no order would be observed in motion, no motion could be regularly continued. He could not be
a full satisfaction to the infinite desire of the souls of his people. Nothing can truly satisfy the soul of man
but rest; and nothing can give it rest but that which is perfect and immutably perfect; for else it would be
subject to those agitations and variations which the being it depends upon is subject to. The principle of
all things must be immutable,614 which is described by some by a unity, the principle of number, wherein
there is a resemblance of God’s unchangeableness. A unit is not variable; it continues in its own nature
immutably a unit. It never varies from itself; it cannot be changed from itself; but is, as it were, so
omnipotent towards others, that it changes all numbers. If you add any number, it is the beginning of that
number, but the unit is not increased by it; a new number ariseth from that addition, but the unit still
remains the same, and adds value to other figures, but receives none from them.
</p>
<p>
    III. The third thing to speak to is, that immutability is proper to God, and incommunicable to any
creature. Mutability is natural to every creature as a creature, and immutability is the sole perfection of
God. He only is infinite wisdom, able to foreknow future events; he only is infinitely powerful, able to
call forth all means to effect; so that wanting neither wisdom to contrive, nor strength to execute, he
cannot alter his counsel. None being above him, nothing in him contrary to him, and being defective in no
blessedness and perfection, he cannot vary in his essence and nature. Had not immutability as well as
eternity been a property solely pertaining to the Divine nature, as well as creative power and eternal
duration, the apostle’s argument to prove Christ to be God from this perpetual sameness, had come short
of any convincing strength. These words of the text he applies to Christ (Heb. 1:10–12): “They shall be
changed, but thou art the same.” There had been no strength in the reason, if immutability by nature did
belong to any creature.
</p>
<p>
    The changeableness of all creatures is evident:
</p>
<p>
    1. Of corporeal creatures it is evident to sense. All plants and animals, as they have their duration
bounded in certain limits; so while they do exist, they proceed from their rise to their fall. They pass
through many sensible alterations, from one degree of growth to another, from buds to blossoms, from
blossoms to flowers and fruits. They come to their pitch that nature had set them, and return back to the
state from whence they sprung; there is not a day but they make some acquisition, or suffer some loss.
They die and spring up every day; nothing in them more certain than their inconstancy: “The creature is
subject to vanity” (Rom. 8:20). The heavenly bodies are changing their place; the sun every day is
running his race, and stays not in the same point; and though they are not changed in their essence, yet
they are in their place. Some, indeed, say there is a continual generation of light in the sun, as there is a
loss of light by the casting out its beams, as in a fountain there is a flowing out of the streams, and a
continual generation of supply. And though these heavenly bodies have kept their standing and motion
from the time of their creation, yet both the sun’s standing still in Joshua’s time, and its going back in
Hezekiah’s time, show that they are changeable at the pleasure of God. But in man the change is
perpetually visible; every day there is a change from ignorance to knowledge, from one will to another,
from passion to passion, sometimes sad and sometimes cheerful, sometimes craving this, and presently
nauseating it; his body changes from health to sickness, or from weakness to strength; some alteration
there is either in body or mind. Man, who is the noblest creature, the subordinate end of the creation of
other things, cannot assure himself of a consistency and fixedness in anything the short space of a day, no,
not of a minute. All his months are months of vanity (Job 7:3); whence the Psalmist calls man at the “best
estate altogether vanity,” a mere heap of vanity (Psalm 35.) As he contains in his nature the nature of all
creatures, so he inherits in his nature the vanity of all creatures. A little world, the centre of the world and
of the vanity of the world; yea, “lighter than vanity” (Psalm 62:9), more movable than a feather; tossed
between passion and passion, daily changing his end, and changing the means; an image of nothing.
</p>
<p>
    2. Spiritual natures, as angels. They change not in their being, but that is from the indulgence of God.
They change not in their goodness, but that is not from their nature, but divine grace in their confirmation;
but they change in their knowledge; they know more by Christ than they did by creation (1 Tim. 3:16).
They have an addition of knowledge every day, by the providential dispensations of God to his church
(Eph. 3:10); and the increase of their astonishment and love is according to the increase of their
knowledge and insight. They cannot have a new discovery without new admirations of what is discovered
to them: there is a change in their joy when there is a change in a sinner (Luke 15:10). They were changed
in their essence, when they were made such glorious spirits of nothing; some of them were changed in
their will, when of holy they became impure. The good angels were changed in their understandings,
when the glories of God in Christ were presented to their view; and all can be changed in their essence
again; and as they were made of nothing, so by the power of God may be reduced to nothing again. So
glorified souls shall have an unchanged operation about God, for they shall behold his face without any
grief or fear of loss, without vagrant thoughts; but they can never be unchangeable in their nature, because
they can never pass from finite to infinite.
</p>
<p>
    No creature can be unchangeable in its nature:—1. Because every creature rose from nothing. As they
rose from nothing, so they tend to nothing, unless they are preserved by God. The notion of a creature
speaks changeableness; because to be a creature is to be made something of nothing, and, therefore,
creation is a change of nothing into something. The being of a creature begins from change, and,
therefore, the essence of a creature is subject to change. God only is uncreated, and, therefore,
unchangeable. If he were made he could not be immutable; for the very making is a change of not being
into being. All creatures were made good, as they were the fruits of God’s goodness and power; but must
needs be mutable, because they were the extracts of nothing. 2. Because every creature depends purely
upon the will of God. They depend not upon themselves, but upon another for their being. As they
received their being from the word of his mouth and the arm of his power, so by the same word they can
be cancelled into nothing, and return into as little significancy as when they were nothing. He that created
them by a word, can by a word destroy them: if God should “take away their breath, they die, and return
mto their dust” (Psalm 104:29). As it was in the power of the Creator that things might be, before they
actually were, so it is in the power of the Creator that things after they are may cease to be what they are;
and they are, in their own nature, as reducible to nothing as they were producible by the power of God
from nothing; for there needs no more than an act of Gods will to null them, as there needed only an act of
God’s will to make them. Creatures are all subject to a higher cause: they are all reputed as nothing. “He
doth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can
stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou?” (Dan. 4:35.) But God is unchangeable, because he is the
highest good; none above him, all below him; all dependent on him; himself upon none. 3. No creature is
absolutely perfect. No creature can be so perfect, or can ever be, but something by the infinite power of
God may be added to it; for whatsoever is finite may receive greater additions, and, therefore, a change.
No creature you can imagine, but in your thoughts you may fancy him capable of greater perfections than
you know he hath, or than really he hath. The perfections of all creatures are searchable; the perfection of
God is only unsearchable (Job 11:6), and, therefore, he only immutable. God only is always the same.
Time makes no addition to him, nor diminisheth anything of him. His nature and essence, his wisdom and
will, have always been the same from eternity, and shall be the same to eternity, without any variation.
</p>
<p>
    IV. The fourth thing propounded is, Some propositions to clear this unchangeableness of God from
anything that seems contrary to it.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. I. There was no change in God when he began to create the world in time. The creation was a
real change, but the change was not subjectively in God, but in the creature; the creature began to be what
it was not before. Creation is considered as active or passive.615 Active creation is the will and power of
God to create. This is from eternity, because God willed from eternity to create in time; this never had
beginning, for God never began in time to understand anything, to will anything, or to be able to do
anything; but he alway understood and alway willed those things which he determined from eternity to
produce in time. The decree of God may be taken for the act decreeing, that is eternal and the same, or for
the object decreed, that is in time; so that there may be a change in the object, but not in the will whereby
the object doth exist.
</p>
<p>
    1. There was no change in God by the act of creation, because there was no new will in him. There
was no new act of his will which was not before. The creation began in time, but the will of creating was
from eternity. The work was new, but the decree whence that new work sprung was as ancient as the
Ancient of Days. When the time of creating came, God was not made ex nolente volens, as we are; for
whatsoever God willed to be now done, he willed from eternity to be done; but be willed also that it
should not be done till such an instant of time, and that it should not exist before such a time. If God had
willed the creation of the world only at that time when the world was produced, and not before, then,
indeed, God had been changeable. But though God spake that word which he had not spoke before,
whereby the world was brought into act; yet he did not will that will he willed not before. God did not
create by a new counsel or new will, but by that which was from eternity (Eph. 1:9). All things are
wrought according to that “purpose in himself,” an according to “the counsel of his will” (ver. 11); and as
the holiness of the elect is the fruit of his eternal will “before the foundation of the world” (ver. 4), so,
likewise, is the existence of things, and of those persons whom he did elect. As when an artificer frames a
house or a temple according to that model he had in his mind some years before, there is no change in the
model in his mind; the artificer is the same, though the work is produced by him some time after he had
framed that copy of it in his own mind, but there is a change of the thing produced by him according to
that model. Or, when a rich man intends, four or five years hence, if he lives, to build a hospital, is there
any change in will, when, after the expiration of that time, he builds and endows it? Though it be after his
will, yet it is the fruit of his precedent will. So God, from all eternity, did will and command that the
creatures should exist in such a part of time; and, by his eternal will, all things, whether past, present, or to
come, did, do, and shall exist, at that point of time which that will did appoint for them: not, as though
God had a new will when things stood up in being, but only that which was prepared in his immutable
counsel and will from eternity, doth then appear. There can be no instant fixed from eternity, wherein it
can be said, God did not will the creation of the world; for had the will of God for the shortest moment
been undetermined to the creation of the world, and afterwards resolved upon it, there had been a moral
change in God from not willing to willing; but this there was not, for God executes nothing in time which
he had not ordained from eternity, and appointed all the means and circumstances whereby it should be
brought about. As the determination of our Saviour to suffer was not a new will, but an eternal counsel,
and wrought no change in God (Acts 2:23).
</p>
<p>
     2. There is no change in God by the act of creation, because there was no new power in God. Had God
had a will at the time of creation which he had not before, there had been a moral change in him; so had
there been in him a power only to create then and not before, there had been a physical change in him
from weakness to ability. There can be no more new power in God, than there can be a new will in God;
for his will is his power, and what he willeth to effect, that he doth effect: as he was unchangeably holy,
so he was unchangeably almighty, “which was, and is, and is to come” (Rev. 4:8); which was almighty,
and is almighty, and ever will be almighty. The work therefore makes no change in God, but there is a
change in the thing wrought by that power of God. Suppose you had a seal engraven upon some metal a
hundred years old, or as old as the creation, and you should this day, so many ages after the engraving of
it, make an impression of that seal upon wax; would you say the engravement upon the seal were
changed, because it produced that stamp upon the wax now which it did not before? No, the change is
purely in the wax, which receives a new figure or form by the impression; not in the seal, that was capable
of imprinting the same long before. God was the same from eternity as he was when he made a signature
of himself upon the creatures by creation, and is no more changed by stamping them into several forms,
than the seal is changed by making impression upon the wax. As when a house is enlightened by the sun,
or that which was cold is heated by it, there is a change in the house from darkness to light, from coldness
to heat; but is there any change in the light and heat of the sun? There is a change in the thing enlightened
or warmed by that light and heat which remains fixed and constant in the sun, which was as capable in
itself to produce the same effects before, as at that instant when it works them; so when God is the author
of a new work, he is not changed, because he works it by an eternal will and an eternal power.
</p>
<p>
     3. Nor is there any new relation acquired by God by the creation of the world. There was a new
relation acquired by the creature, as, when a man sins, he hath another relation to God than he had
before,—he hath relation to God, as a criminal to a Judge; but there is no change in God, but in the
malefactor. The being of men makes no more change in God than the sins of men. As a tree is now on our
right hand, and by our turning about it is on our left hand, sometimes before us, sometimes behind us,
according to our motion near it or about it, and the turning of the body; there is no change in the tree,
which remains firm and fixed in the earth, but the change is wholly in the posture of the body, whereby
the tree may be said to be before us or behind us, or on the right hand or on the left hand.616 God gained
no new relation of Lord or Creator by the creation; for though he had created nothing to rule over, yet he
had the power to create and rule, though he did not create and rule: as a man may be called a skilful
writer, though he does not write, because he is able to do it when he pleases; or a man skilful in physic is
called a physician, though he doth not practise that skill, or discover his art in the distribution of
medicines, because he may do it when he pleases; it depends upon his own will to show his art when he
has a mind to it. So the name Creator and Lord belongs to God from eternity, because he could create and
rule, though he did not create and rule. But, howsoever, if there were any such change of relation, that
God may be called Creator and Lord after the creation and not before, it is not a change in essence, nor in
knowledge, nor in will; God gains no perfection nor diminution by it; his knowledge is not increased by
it; he is no more by it than he was, and will be, if all those things ceased; and therefore Austin illustrates it
by this similitude:—as a piece of money when it is given as the price of a thing, or deposited only as a
pledge for the security of a thing borrowed; the coin is the same, and is not change though the relation it
had as a pledge and as a price be different from one another: so that suppose any new relation be added,
yet there is nothing happens to the nature of God which may infer any change.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. II. There was no change in the Divine nature of the Son, when he assumed human nature. There
was an union of the two natures, but no change of the Deity into the humanity, or of the humanity into the
Deity: both preserved their peculiar properties. The humanity was changed by a communication of
excellent gifts from the divine nature, not by being brought into an equality with it, for that was
impossible that a creature should become equal to the Creator. He took the “form of a servant,” but he lost
not the form of God; he despoiled not himself of the perfections of the Deity. He was indeed emptied,
“and became of no reputation” (Phil. 2:7); but he did not cease to be God, though he was reputed to be
only a man, and a very mean one too. The glory of his divinity was not extinguished nor diminished,
though it was obscured and darkened, under the veil of our infirmities; but there was no more change in
the hiding of it, than there is in the body of the sun when it is shadowed by the interposition of a cloud.
His blood while it was pouring out from his veins was the “blood of God” (Acts 20:28); and, therefore,
when he was bowing the head of his humanity upon the cross, he had the nature and perfections of God;
for had he ceased to be God, he had been a mere creature, and his sufferings would have been of as little
value and satisfaction as the sufferings of a creature. He could not have been a sufficient Mediator, had he
ceased to be God: and he had ceased to be God, had he lost any one perfection proper to the divine nature;
and losing none, he lost not this of unchangeableness, which is none of the meanest belonging to the
Deity. Why by his union with the human nature should he lose this, any more than he lost his
omniscience, which he discovered by his knowledge of the thoughts of men; or his mercy, which he
manifested to the height in the time of his suffering? That is truly a change, when a thing ceaseth to be
what it was before: this was not in Christ; he assumed our nature without laying aside his own. When the
soul is united to the body, doth it lose any of those perfections that are proper to its nature? Is there any
change either in the substance or qualities of it? No; but it makes a change in the body, and of a dull lump
it makes it a living mass, conveys vigor and strength to it, and, by its power, quickens it to sense and
motion.617 So did the divine nature and human remain entire; there was no change of the one into the
other, as Christ by a miracle changed water into wine, or men by art change sand or ashes into glass: and
when he prays “for the glory he had with God before the world was” (John 17:5), he prays that a glory he
had in his Deity might shine forth in his person as Mediator, and be evidenced in that height and splendor
suitable to his dignity, which had been so lately darkened by his abasement; that as he had appeared to be
the Son of Man in the infirmity of the flesh, he might appear to be the Son of God in the glory of his
person, that he might appear to be the Son of God and the Son of Man in one person.618 Again, there
could be no change in this union; for, in a real change, something is acquired which was not possessed
before, neither formally nor eminently: but the divinity had from eternity, before the incarnation, all the
perfections of the human nature eminently in a nobler manner than they are in themselves, and therefore
could not be changed by a real umon.619
</p>
<p>
    Prop. III. Repentance and other affections ascribed to God in Scripture, argue no change in God. We
often read of God’s repenting, repenting of the good he promised (Jer. 18:10), and of the evil he
threatened (Exod. 32:14; John 3:10), or of the work he hath wrought (Gen. 6:6). We must observe,
therefore, that,
</p>
<p>
    1. Repentance is not properly in God. He is a pure Spirit, and is not capable of those passions which
are signs of weakness and impotence, or subject to those regrets we are subject to. Where there is a proper
repentance there is a want of foresight, an ignorance of what would succeed, or a defect in the
examination of the occurrences which might fall within consideration. All repentance of a fact is
grounded upon a mistake is the event which was not foreseen, or upon an after knowledge of the evil of
the thing which was acted by the person repenting. But God is so wise that he cannot err, so holy he
cannot do evil; and his certain prescience, or foreknowledge, secures him against any unexpected events.
God doth not act but upon clear and infallible reason; and a change upon passion is accounted by all so
great a weakness in man, that none can entertain so unworthy a conceit of God. Where he is said to repent
(Gen. 6:6), be is also said to grieve; now no proper grief can be imagined to be in God. As repentance is
inconsistent with infallible foresight, so is grief no less inconsistent with undefiled blessedness. God is
“blessed forever” (Rom. 9:8), and therefore nothing can befall him that can stain that blessedness. His
blessedness would be impaired and interrupted while he is repenting, though he did soon rectify that
which is the cause of his repentance. “God is of one mind, and who can turn him? what his soul desires
that he doth” (Job 23:13).
</p>
<p>
    2. But God accommodates himself in the Scripture to our weak capacity. God hath no more of a
proper repentance, than he hath of a real body; though he, in accommodation to our weakness, ascribes to
himself the members of our bodies to set out to our understanding the greatness of his perfections, we
must not conclude him a body like us; so, because he is said to have anger and repentance, we must not
conclude him to have passions like us. When we cannot fully comprehend him as he is, he clothes himself
with our nature in his expressions that we may apprehend him as we are able, and by an inspection into
ourselves, learn something of the nature of God; yet those human ways of speaking ought to be
understood in a manner agreeable to the infinite excellency and majesty of God, and are only designed to
mark out something in God which hath a resemblance with something in us; as we cannot speak to God as
gods, but as men, so we cannot understand him speaking to us as a God, unless he condescend to speak to
us like a man. God therefore frames his language to our dulness, not to his own state, and informs us by
our own phrases, what he would have us learn of his nature, as nurses talk broken language to young
children. In all such expressions, therefore, we must ascribe the perfection we conceive in them to God,
and lay the imperfection at the door of the creature.
</p>
<p>
    3. Therefore, repentance in God is only a change of his outward conduct, according to his infallible
foresight and immutable will. He changes the way of his providential proceeding according to the carriage
of the creature, without changing his will, which is the rule of his providence. When God speaks of his
repenting “that he had made man” (Gen. 6:6), it is only his changing his conduct from a way of kindness
to a way of severity, and is a word suited to our capacities to signify his detestation of sin, and his
resolution to punish it, after man had made himself quite another thing, than God had made him; “it
repents me,” that is, I am purposed to destroy the world, as he that repents of his work throws it away;620
as if a potter cast away the vessel he had framed, it were a testimony that he repented that ever he took
pains about it, so the destruction of them seems to be a repentance in God that ever he made them; it is a
change of events, not of counsels. Repentance in us is a grief for a former fact, and a changing of our
course in it; grief is not in God, but his repentance is a willing a thing should not be as it was, which will
was fixed from eternity; for God, foreseeing man would fall, and decreeing to permit it, he could not be
said to repent in time of what he did not repent from eternity; and therefore, if there were no repentance in
God from eternity, there could be none in time.621 But God is said to repent when he changes the
disposition of affairs without himself; as men, when they repent, alter the course of their actions, so God
alters things, extra sc, or without himself, but changes nothing of his own purpose within himself. It rather
notes the action he is about to do, than anything in his own nature, or any change in his eternal purpose.
God’s repenting of his kindness is nothing but an inflicting of punishment, which the creature by the
change of his carriage hath merited: as his repenting of the evil threatened is the withholding the
punishment denounced, when the creature hath humbly submitted to his authority, and acknowledged his
crime. Or else we may understand those expressions of joy, and grief, and repentance, to signify thus
much, that the things declared to be the objects of joy, and grief, and repentance, are of that nature, that if
God were capable of our passions, he would discover himself in such cases as we do; as when the
prophets mention the joys and applaudings of heaven, earth, and the sea, they only signify that the things
they speak of are so good, that if the heavens and the sea had natures capable of joy, they would express it
upon that occasion in such a manner as we do; so would God have joy at the obedience of men, and grief
at the unworthy carriage of men, and repent of his kindness when men abuse it, and repent of his
punishment when men reform under his rod, were the majesty of his nature capable of such affections.622
</p>
<p>
     Prop. IV. The not fulfilling of some predictions in Scripture, which seem to imply a changeableness
of the Divine will, do not argue any change in it. As when he reprieved Hezekiah from death, after a
message sent by the prophet Isaiah, that he should die (2 Kings 20:1–5; Isa. 38:1–5), and when he made
an arrest of that judgment he had threatened by Jonah against Nineveh (Jon. 3:4–10). There is not, indeed,
the same reason of promises and threatenings altogether; for in promising, the obligation lies upon God,
and the right to demand is in the party that performsthe condition of the promise: but in threatenings, the
obligation lies upon the sinner, and God’s right to punish is declared thereby; so that through God doth
not punish, his will is not changed, because his will was to declare the demerit of sin, and his right to
punish upon the commission of it; though he may not punish according to the strict letter of the
threatening the person sinning, but relax his own law for the honor of his attributes, and transfer the
punishment from the offender to a person substituted in his room: this was the case in the first threatening
against man, and the substituting a Surety in the place of the malefactor. But the answer to these cases is
this, that where we find predictions in Scripture declared, and yet not executed, we must consider them,
not as absolute but conditional, or as the civil law calls it, an interlocutory sentence.623 God declared what
would follow by natural causes, or by the demerit of man, not what he would absolutely himself do: and
in many of those predictions, though the condition be not expressed, yet it is to be understood; so the
promises of God are to be understood, with the condition of perseverance in well doing; and threatenings,
with a clause of revocation annexed to them, provided that men repent: and this God lays down as a
general case, alway to be remembered as a rule for the interpreting his threatenings against a nation, and
the same reason will hold in threatenings against a particular person. (Jer. 18:7–10) “At what instant I
shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and destroy it;
if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought
to do unto them;” and so when he speaks of planting a nation, if they do evil, he will repent of the good,
&amp;c. It is a universal rule by which all particular cases of this nature are to be tried; so that when man’s
repentance arrives, God remains firm in his first will, always equal to himself; and it is not he that
changes, but man. For since the interposition of the Mediator, with an eye to whom God governed the
world after the fall, the right of punishing was taken off if men repented, and mercy was to flow out, if by
a conversion men returned to their duty (Ezek. 18:20, 21). This, I say, is grounded upon God’s
entertaining the Mediator; for the covenant of works discovered no such thing as repentance or pardon.
Now these general rules are to be the interpreters of particular cases: so that predictions of good are not to
be counted absolute, if men return to evil; nor predictions of evil, if men be thereby reduced to a
repentance of their crimes. So Nineveh shall be destroyed, that is, according to the general rule, unless the
inhabitants repent, which they did; they manifested a belief of the threatening, and gave glory to God by
giving credit to the prophet: and they had a notion of this rule God lays down in the other prophets; for
they had an apprehension that, upon their humbling themselves, they might escape the threatened
vengeance, and stop the shooting those arrows that were ready in the bow.624 Though Jonah proclaimed
destruction without declaring any hopes of an arrest of judgment, yet their natural notion of God afforded
some natural hopes of relief if they did their duty, and spurned not against the prophet’s message; and
therefore, saith one, God did not always express this condition, because it was needless; his own rule
revealed in Scripture was sufficient to some; and the natural notion all men had of God’s goodness upon
their repentance, made it not absolutely necessary to declare it. And besides, saith he, it is bootless; the
expressing it can do but little good; secure ones will repent never the sooner, but rather presume upon
their hopes of God’s forbearance, and linger out their repentance till it be too late. And to work men to
repentance, whom he hath purposed to spare, he threatens them with terrible judgments; which by how
much the more terrible and peremptory they are, are likely to be more effectual for that end God in his
purpose designs them; viz. to humble them under a sense of their demerit, and an acknowledgment of his
righteous justice; and, therefore, though they be absolutely denounced, yet they are to be conditionally
interpreted with a reservation of repentance. As for that answer which one gives, that by forty days was
not meant forty natural days, but forty prophetical days, that is years, a day for a year; and that the city
was destroyed forty years after by the Medes; the expression of God’s repenting upon their humiliation
puts a bar to that interpretation; God repented, that is, he did not bring the punishment upon them
according to those days the prophet had expressed; and, therefore, forty natural days are to be understood;
and if it were meant forty years, and they were destroyed at the end of that term, how could God be said to
repent, since according to that, the punishment threatened was, according to the time fixed, brought upon
them? and the destruction of it forty years after will not be easily evinced, if Jonah lived in the time of
Jeroboam, the second king of Israel, as he did (2 Kings 14:25); and Nineveh was destroyed in the time of
Josiah, king of Judah. But the other answer is plain. God did not fulfil what he had threatened, because
they reformed what they had committed: when the threatening was made, they were a fit object for
justice; but when they repented, they were a fit object for a merciful respite. To threaten when sins are
high, is a part of God’s justice; not to execute when sins are revoked by repentance, is a part of God’s
goodness. And in the case of Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:1, 5), Isaiah comes with a message from God, that he
should “set his house in order,” for he shall die; that is, the disease was mortal, and no outward
applications could in their own nature resist the distemper: “Behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years; I
will heal thee” (Isa. 38:1, 5). It seems to me to be one entire message, because the latter part of it was so
suddenly after the other committed to Isaiah, to be delivered to Hezekiah; for he was not gone out of the
king’s house, before he was ordered to return with the news of his health, by an extraordinary indulgence
of God against the power of nature and force of the disease, “Behold, I will add to thy life;” noting it as an
extraordinary thing; he was in the second court of the king’s house when this word came to him (2 Kings
20:4); the king’s house having three courts, so that he was not gone above half-way out of the palace. God
might send this message of death, to prevent the pride Hezekiah might swell with for his deliverance from
Sennacherib: as Paul had a messenger of Satan to buffet him to prevent his lifting up (2 Cor. 12:7); and
this good man was subject to this sin, as we find afterwards in the case of the Babylonish ambassadors;
and God delayed this other part of the message to humble him, and draw out his prayer: and as soon as
ever he found Hezekiah in this temper, he sent Isaiah with a comfortable message of recovery; so that the
will of God was to signify to him the mortality of his distemper, and afterwards to relieve him by a
message of an extraordinary recovery.

<p>
    Prop. V. God is not changed, when of loving to any creatures he becomes angry with them, or of
angry he becomes appeased. The change in these cases is in the creature; according to the alteration in the
creature, it stands in a various relation to God: an innocent creature is the object of his kindness, an
offending creature is the object of his anger; there is a change in the dispensations of God, as there is a
change in the creature making himself capable of such dispensations. God always acts according to the
immutable nature of his holiness, and can no more change in his affections to good and evil, than he can
in his essence. When the devils, now fallen, stood as glorious angels, they were the objects of God’s love,
because holy; when they fell, they were the objects of God’s hatred, because impure; the same reason
which made him love them while they were pure, made him hate them when they were criminal. The
reason of his various dispensations to them was the same in both, as considered in God, his immutable
holiness; but as respecting the creature, different; the nature of the creature was changed, but the Divine
holy nature of God remained the same: “With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure, and with the froward,
thou wilt show thyself froward” (Psalm 18:26): he is a refreshing light to those that obey him, and a
consuming fire to those that resist him. Though the same angels were not always loved, yet the same
reason that moved him to love them, moved him to hate them. It had argued a change in God if he had
loved them alway, in whatsoever posture they were towards him; it could not be counted love, but a
weakness and impotent fondness; the change is in the object, not in the affection of God; for the object
loved before is not beloved now, because that which was the motive of love, is not now in it; so that the
creature having a different state from what it had, falls under a different affection or dispensation. It had
been a mutable affection in God to love that which was not worthy of love with the same love wherewith
be loved that which had the greatest resemblance to himself; had God loved the fallen angels in that state
and for that state, he had hated himself, because he had loved that which was contrary to himself and the
image of his own holiness, which made them appear before, good in his sight. The will of God is
unchangeably set to love righteousness and hate iniquity, and from this hatred to punish it; and if a
righteous creature contracts the wrath of God, or a sinful creature hath the communications of God’s love,
it must be by a change in themselves. Is the sun changed when it hardens one thing and softens another,
according to the disposition of the several subjects? Or when the sun makes a flower more fragrant, and a
dead carcass more noisome? There are divers effects, but the reason of that diversity is not in the sun, but
in the subject; the sun is the same, and produceth those different effects by the same quality of heat; so if
an unholy soul approach to God, God looks angrily upon him; if a holy soul come before him, the same
immutable perfection in God draws out his kindness towards him: as some think, the sun would rather
refresh than scorch us, if our bodies were of the same nature and substance with that luminary. As the will
of God for creating the world was no new, but an eternal will, though it manifested itself in time, so the
will of God for the punishment of sin, or the reconciliation of the sinner, was no new will: though his
wrath in time break out in the effects of it upon sinners, and his love flows out in the effects of it upon
penitents. Christ by his death reconciling God to man, did not alter the will of God, but did what was
consonant to his eternal will; he came not to change his will, but to execute his will: “Lo, I come to do thy
will, O God” (Heb. 10:7). And the grace of God in Christ was not a new grace, but an old grace in a new
appearance; “the grace of God hath appeared” (Tit. 1:11).
</p>
<p>
     Prop. VI. A change of laws by God argues no change in God, when God abrogates some laws which
he had settled in the church, and enacts others. I spake of this something the last day; I shall only add this:
God commanded one thing to the Jews, when the church was in an infant state; and removed those laws,
when the church came to some growth. The elements of the world were suited to the state of children
(Gal. 4:3). A mother feeds not the infant with the same diet as she doth when it is grown up. Our Saviour
acquainted not his disciples with some things at one time which he did at another, because they were not
able to bear them: where was the change; in Christ’s will, or in their growth from a state of weakness to
that of strength? A physician prescribes not the same thing to a person in health, as he doth to one
conflicting with a distemper; nor the same thing in the beginning as he doth in the state or declination of
the disease. The physician’s will and skill are the same, but the capacity and necessity of the patient for
this or that medicine, or method of proceeding, are not the same. When God changed the ceremonial law,
there was no change in the Divine will, but an execution of his will; for when God commanded the
observance of the law he intended not the perpetuity of it; nay, in the prophets he declares the cessation of
it; he decreed to command it, but he decreed to command it only for such a time; so that the abrogation of
it was no less an execution of his decree, than the establishment of it for a season was; the commanding of
it was pursuant to his decree for the appointing of it, and the nulling of it was pursuant to his decree of
continuing it only for such a season; so that in all this there was no change in the will of God. The counsel
of God stands sure; what changes soever there are in the world, are not in God or his will, but in the
events of things, and the different relations of things to God: it is in the creature, not in the Creator. The
sun alway remains of the same hue, and is not discolored in itself, because it shines green through a green
glass, and blue through a blue glass; the different colors come from the glass, not from the sun; the change
is alway in the disposition of the creature, and not in the nature of God or his will.

<p>
     V. Use 1. For information.
</p>
<p>
     1. If God be unchangeable in his nature, and immutability be a property of God, then Christ hath a
Divine nature. This in the Psalm is applied to Christ in the Hebrews (Heb. 1:11), where he joins the
citation out of this Psalm with that out of Psalm 45:6, 7, “Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; thou
hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
of gladness above thy fellows; and thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,” &amp;c.
As the first must necessarily be meant of Christ the Mediator, and therein he is distinguished from God, as
one anointed by him; so the other must be meant of Christ, whereby he is made one with God in regard of
the creation and dissolution of the world, in regard of eternity and immutability. Both the testimonies are
linked together by the copulative and, “and thou, Lord;” declaring thereby that they are both to be
understood of the same person, the Son of God. The design of the chapter is to prove Christ to be God;
and such things are spoken of him as could not belong to any creature; no, not to the most excellent of the
angels. The same person that is said to be anointed above his fellows, and is said to lay the foundation of
the earth and heavens, is said to be the same; that is, the same in himself; the prerogative of sameness
belongs to that person as well as creation of heaven and earth. The Socinians say it is spoken of God, and
that God shall destroy the heavens by Christ; if so, Christ is not a mere creature, not created when he was
incarnate; for the same person that shall change the world did create the world; if God shall change the
world by him, God also created the world by him; he was then before the world was; for how could God
create the world by one that was not; that was not in being till after the creation of the world. 2 The
heavens shall be changed, but the person who is to change the heavens is said to be the same, or
unchangeable in the creation as well as the dissolution of the world. This sameness refers to the whole
sentence. The Psalm wherein the text is, and whence this in the Hebrews is cited, is properly meant of
Christ, and redemption by him, and the completing of it at the last day, and not of the Babylonish
captivity;625 that captivity was not so deplorable as the state of the Psalmist describes; Daniel and his
companions flourished in that captivity; it could not reasonably be said of them, that their days were
consumed like smoke, their hearts withered like grass; that they forgot to “eat their bread” (ver. 3, ver. 4).
Besides, he complains of “shortness of life” (ver. 11); but none had any more reason to complain of that
in the time of the captivity, than before and after it, than at any other time: their deliverance would
contribute nothing to the natural length of their lives. Besides, when Sion should be built, the heathen
should “fear the name of the Lord” (that is, worship God), and “all the kings of the earth his glory” (ver.
15). The rearing the second temple after the deliverance, did not proselyte the nations; nor did the kings of
the earth worship the glory of God; nor did God appear in such glory at the erecting the second temple.
The second temple was less glorious than the first, for it wanted some of the ornaments which were the
glory of the first; but it is said of this state, that when the Lord should build up Sion, he should “appear in
his glory” (ver. 16); his proper glory, and extraordinary glory. Now that God who shall appear in glory,
and build up Sion, is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world; he builds up the church, he causes the
nations to fear the Lord, and the kings of the earth his glory; he broke down the partition wall, and opened
a door for the entrance of the Gentiles; he struck the chains from off the prisoners, and loosed those that
were appointed to death by the curse of the law (ver. 20): and to this person is ascribed the creation of the
world; and he is pronounced to remain the same in the midst of an infinite number of changes in inferior
things. And it is likely the Psalmist considers not only the beginning of redemption, but the completing of
it at the second coming of Christ; for he complains of those evils which shall be removed by his second
coming, viz., the shortness of life, persecutions and reproaches wherewith the church is aficted in this
world; and comforts not himself with those attributes which are directly opposed to sin, as the mercy of
God, the covenant of God, but with those that are opposed to mortality and calamities, as the
unchangeableness and eternity of God; and from thence infers a perpetual establishment of believers.
“The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee” (ver. 28): so
that the Psalm itself seems to aim in the whole discourse at Christ, and asserts his divinity, which the
apostle, as an interpreter, doth fully evidence; applying it to him, and manifesting his deity by his
immutability as well as eternity.626 While all other things lose their forms, and pass through multitudes of
variations, he constantly remains the same, and shall be the same, when all the empires of the world shall
slide away, and a period be put to the present motions of the creation: and as there was no change made in
his being by the creation of things, so neither shall there be by the final alteration of things; he shall see
them finish, as he saw them rise up into being, and be the same after their reign, as he was before their
original; he is the first and the last (Rev. 1:17).

     2. Here is ground and encouragement for worship. An atheist will make another use of this; if God be
immutable, why should we worship him, why should we pray to him? good will come if he wills it; evil
cannot be averted by all our supplications, if he hath ordained it to fall upon us. But certainly since
unchangeableness is knowing, and willing goodness is a perfection, an adoration and admiration is due to
God, upon the account of this excellence. If he be God, he is to be reverenced, and the more highly
reverenced, because he cannot but be God. Again, what comfort could it be to pray to a God, that like the
chameleon changed colors every day, every moment? What encouragement could there be to lift up our
eyes to one that were of one mind this day and of another mind tomorrow? Who would put up a petition
to an earthly prince that were so mutable, as to grant a petition one day and deny it another, and change
his own act? But if a prince promise this or that thing upon such or such a condition, and you know his
promise to be as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, would any man reason thus?
because it is unchangeable we will not seek to him, we will not perform the condition, upon which the
fruit of the proclamation is to be enjoyed. Who would not count such an inference ridiculous? What
blessings hath not God promised upon the condition of seeking him? Were he of an unrighteous nature, or
changeable in his mind, this would be a bar to our seeking him, and frustrate our hopes; but since it is
otherwise, is not this excellency of his nature the highest encouragement, to ask of him the blessings he
hath promised, and a beam from heaven to fire our zeal in asking? If you sire things against his will,
which he hath declared he will not grant, prayer then would be an act of disobedience and injury to him,
as well as an act of folly in itself; his unchangeableness then might stifle such desires: but if we ask
according to his will, and according to our reasonable wants, what ground have we to make such a
ridiculous argument? He hath willed everything that may be for our good, if we perform the condition he
hath required; and hath put it upon record, that we may know it and regulate our desires and supplications
according to it. If we will not seek him, his immutability cannot be a bar, but our own folly is the cause;
and by our neglect we despoil him of this perfection as to us, and either imply that he is not sincere, and
means not as he speaks; or that he is as changeable as the wind, sometimes this thing, sometimes that, and
not at all to be confided in. If we ask according to his revealed will, the unchangeableness of his nature
will assure us of the grant; and what a presumption would it be in a creature dependent upon his
sovereign, to ask that which he knows he bass declared his will against; since there is no good we can
want, but he hath promised to give, upon our sincere and ardent desire for it? God hath decreed to give
this or that to man, but conditionally, and by the means of inquiring after him, and asking for it: “Ask, and
you shall receive” (Ezek. 36:37; Matt. 7:7): as much as to say, You shall not receive unless you ask.
When the highest promises are made, God expects they should be put in suit; our Saviour joins the
promise and the petition together; the promise to encourage the petition, and the petition to enjoy the
promise: he doth not say perhaps it shall be given, but it shall, that is, it certainly shall; your heavenly
Father is unchangeably willing to give you those things. We must depend upon his immutability for the
thing, and submit to his wisdom for the time. Prayer is an acknowledgment of our dependence upon God;
which dependence could have no firm foundation without unchangeableness. Prayer doth not desire any
change in God, but is offered to God that he would confer those things which he hath immutably willed to
communicate; but he willed them not without prayer as the means of bestowing them. The light of the sun
is ordered for our comfort, for the discovery of visible things, for the ripening the fruits of the earth; but
withal it is required that we use our faculty of seeing, that we employ our industry in sowing and planting,
and expose our fruits to the view of the sun, that they may receive the influence of it. If a man shuts his
eyes, and complains that the sun is changed into darkness, it would be ridiculous; the sun is not changed,
but we alter ourselves; nor is God changed in not giving us the blessings he hath promised, because he
hath promised in the way of a due address to him, and opening our souls to receive his influence, and to
this, his immutability is the greatest encouragement.
</p>
<p>
    3. This shows how contrary man is to God in regard of his inconstancy. What an infinite distance is
there between the immutable God, and mutable man, and how should we bewail this flittingness in our
nature! There is a mutability in us as creatures, and a creature cannot but be mutable by nature, otherwise
it were not a creature but God. The establishment of any creature is from grace and gift; naturally we tend
to nothing, as we come from nothing. This creature-rnutability is not our sin, yet it should cause us to lie
down under a sense of our own nothingness, in the presence of the Creator. The angels as creatures,
though not corrupt, cover their faces before him: and the arguments God uses to humble Job, though a
fallen creature, are not from his corruption: for I do not remember that he taxed him with that; but from
the greatness of his majesty and excellency of his nature declared in his works (Job 38–41.); and,
therefore, men that have no sense of God and humility before him, forget that they are creatures as well as
corrupt ones. How great is the distance between God and us, in regard of our inconstancy in good, which
is not natural to us by creation: for the mind and affections were regular, and by the great artificer were
pointed to God as the object of knowledge and love. We have the same faculties of understanding, will,
and affection, as Adam had in innocence; but not with the same light, the same bias, and the same ballast.
Man, by his fall, wounded his head and heart; the wound in his head made him unstable in the truth, and
that in his heart unsteadfast in his affections: he changed himself from the image of God to that of the
devil, from innocence to corruption, and from an ability to be steadfast to a perpetual inconstancy; “his
silver became dross, and his wine was mixed with water” (Isa. 1:22). He changed,
</p>
<p>
    (1.) To inconstancy in truth, opposed to the immutability of knowledge in God. How are our minds
floating between ignorance and knowledge! Truth in us is like those ephemera, creatures of a day’s
continuance,—springs up in the morning, and expires at night. How soon doth that fly away from us
which we have had, not only some weak flashes of, but which we have learned and have had some relish
of! The devil stood not in the truth (John 8:44), and therefore manages his engines to make us as unstable
as himself: our minds reel, and corrupt reasonings oversway us; like sponges we suck up water, and a
light compression makes us spout it out again. Truths are not engraven upon our hearts, but writ as in
dust, defaced by the next puff of wind, “carried about with every wind of doctrine” (Eph. 4:14); like a
ship without a pilot and sails, at the courtesy of the next storm, or like clouds that are tenants to the wind
and sun, moved by the wind and melted by the sun. The Galatians were no sooner called into the grace of
God, but they were removed from it (Gal. 1:6); some have been reported to have menstruam fidem, kept
an opinion for a month; and many are like him that believed the soul’s immortality no longer than he had
Plato’s book of that subject in his hand:627 one likens such to children; they play with truths as children do
with babies, one while embrace them, and a little after throw them into the dirt. How soon do we forget
what the truth is delivered to us, and what it represented us to be (James 1:23, 24). Is it not a thing to be
bewailed, that man should be such a weathercock, turned about with every breath of wind, and shifting
aspects as the wind shifts points?
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Inconstancy in will, and affections opposed to the immutability of will in God. We waver between
God and Baal; and while we are not only resolving, but upon motion a little way, look back with a
hankering after Sodom; sometimes lifted up with heavenly intentions, and presently cast down with
earthly cares, like a ship that by an advancing wave seems to aspire to heaven, and the next fall of the
waves makes it sink down to the depths. We change purposes oftener than fashions, and our resolutions
are like letters in water, whereof no mark remains; we will be as John to-day to love Christ, and as Judas
to-morrow to betray hhn, and, by an unworthy levity, pass into the camp of the enemies of God; resolved
to be as holy as angels in the morning, when the evening beholds us as impure as devils. How often do we
hate what before we loved, and shun what before we longed for! and our resolutions are like vessels of
crystal, which break at the first knock, are dashed in pieces by the next temptation. Saul resolved not to
persecute David any more, but you soon find him upon his old game. Pharaoh more than once promised,
and probably resolved, to let Israel go, but at the end of the storm his purposes vanish (Exod. 8:27, 32).
When an affliction pincheth men, they intend to change their course, and the next news of ease changes
their intentions; like a bow not fully bent in their inclinations, they cannot reach the mark, but live many
years between resolutions of obedience and affections to rebellion (Psalm 78:17): and what promises men
make to God are often the fruit of their passion, their fear, not of their will. The Israelites were startled at
the terrors wherewith the law was delivered, and promised obedience (Exod. 20:19), but a month after
forgot them, and make a golden calf, and in the sight of Sinai call for, and dance before, their gods (Exod.
32.); ncver people more unconstant. Peter, who vowed an allegiance to his Master, and a courage to stick
to him, forswears him almost with the same breath. Those that cry out with a zeal, “The Lord he is God,”
shortly after return to the service of their idols (1 Kings 18:39). That which seems to be our pleasure this
day, is our vexation to-morrow; a fear of a judgment puts us into a religious pang, and a love to our lusts
reduceth us to a rebellious inclination; as soon as the danger is over, the saint is forgotten: salvation and
damnation present themselves to us, touch us, and engender some weak wishes, which are dissolved by
the next allurements of a carnal interest. No hold can be taken of our promises, no credit is to be given to
our resolutions.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) Inconstancy in practice. How much beginning in the Spirit, and ending in the flesh; one day in the
sanctuary, another in the stews; clear in the morning as the sun, and clouded before noon; in heaven by an
excellency of gifts, in hell by a course of profaneness; like a flower, which some mention, that changes its
color three times a day, one art white, then purple, then yellow! The spirit lusts against the flesh, and the
flesh quickly triumphs over the spirit. In a good man how often is there a spiritual lethargy; though he
doth not openly defame God, yet he doth not always glorify him; he doth not forsake the truth, but he doth
not always make the attainment of it, and settlement in it his business. This levity discovers itself in
religious duty, “when I would do good, evil is present with me” (Rom. 7:21). Never more present, than
when we have a mind to do good, and never more present than when we have a mind to do the best and
greatest good. How hard is it to make our thoughts and affections keep their stand! place them upon a
good object, and they will be frisking from it, as a bird from one bough, one fruit, to another: we vary
postures according to the various objects we meet with. The course of the world is a very airy thing,
suited to the uncertain notions of that “prince of the power of the air,” which works in it (Eph. 2:2). This
ought to be bewailed by us. Though we may stand fast in the truth, though we may spin our resolutions
into a firm web, though the spirit may triumph over the flesh in our practice, yet we ought to bewail it,
because inconstancy is our nature, and what fixedness we have in good is from grace. What we find
practised by most men is natural to all;628 “as face answers to face in a glass, so doth heart to heart” (Prov.
27:19); a face in the glass is not more like a natural face, whose image it is, than one man’s heart is
naturally like another.
</p>
<p>
    1st. It is natural to those out of the church. Nebuchadnezzar is so affected with Daniel’s prophetic
spirit, that he would have none accounted the true God, but the “God of Daniel” (Dan. 2:47). How soon
doth this notion slip from him, and an image must be set up for all to worship, upon pain of a most cruel,
painful death! Daniel’s God is quite forgotten. The miraculous deliverance of the three children, for not
worshipping his image, makes him settle a decree to secure the honor of God from the reproach of his
subjects (Dan. 3:29); yet, a little while after, you have him strutting in his palace, as if there were no God
but himself.
</p>
<p>
    2d. It is natural to those in the Church. The Israelites were the only church God had in the world, and a
notable example of inconsistancy. After the miracles of Egypt, they murmured against God, when they
saw Pharaoh marching with an army at their heels. They desired food, and soon nauseated the manna they
were before fond of. When they came into Canaan, they sometimes worshipped God, and sometimes
idols, not only the idols of one nation, but of all their neighbors. In which regard God calls this, his
heritage; “a speckled bird” (Jer. 12:9); a peacock, saith Hierom, inconstant, made up of varieties of
idolatrous colors and ceremonies. This levity of spirit is the root of all mischief; it scatters our thoughts in
the service of God; it is the cause of all revolts and apostasies from him; it makes us unfit to receive the
communications of God whatsoever we hear is like words writ in sand, ruffled out by the next gale;
whatsoever is put into us is like precious liquor in a palsy hand, soon spilt: it breeds distrust of God when
we have an uncertain judgment of him, we are not like to confide in him; an uncertain judgment will be
followed with a distrustful heart. In fine, where it is prevalent, it is a certain sign of ungodliness. To be
driven with the wind like chaff, and to be ungodly, is all one in the judgment of the Holy Ghost (Psalm
1:4); the ungodly are “like the chaff which the wind drives away,” which signifies not their destruction,
but their disposition, for their destruction is inferred from it (ver. 5), “therefore the ungodly shall not stand
in judgment.” How contrary is this to the unchangeable God, who is alway the same, and would have us
the same, in our religious promises and resolutions for good!
</p>
<p>
    4. If God be immutable, it is sad news to those that are resolved in wickedness, or careless of
returning to that duty he requires. Sinners must not expect that God will alter his will, make a breach upon
his nature, and violate his own word to gratify their lusts. No, it is not reasonable God should dishonor
himself to secure them, and cease to be God, that they may continue to be wicked, by changing his own
nature, that they may be unchanged in their vanity. God is the same; goodness is as amiable in his sight,
and sin as abominable in his eyes now, as it was at the beginning of the world. Being the same God, he is
the same enemy to the wicked as the same friend to the righteous. He is the same in knowledge, and
cannot forget sinful acts. He is the same in will, and cannot approve of unrighteous practices. Goodness
cannot but be alway the object of his love, and wickedness cannot but be alway the object of his hatred:
and as his aversion to sin is alway the same, so as he hath been in his judgments upon sinners, the same he
will be still; for the same perfection of immutability belongs to his justice for the punishment of sin, as to
his holiness for his disaffection to sin. Though the covenant of works was changeable by the crime of man
violating it, yet it was unchangeable in regard of God’s justice vindicating it, which is inflexible in the
punishment of the breaches of his law. The law had a preceptive part, and a minatory part: when man
changed the observation of the precept, the righteous nature of God could not null the execution of the
threatening; he could not, upon the account of this perfection, neglect his just word, and countenance the
unrighteous transgression. Though there were no more rational creatures in being but Adam and Eve, yet
God subjected them to that death he had assured them of: and from this immutability of his will, ariseth
the necessity of the suffering of the Son of God for the relief of the apostate creature. His will in the
second covenant is as unchangeable as that in the first, only repentance is settled as the condition of the
second, which was not indulged in the first; and without repentance, the sinner must irrevocably perish, or
God must change his nature: there must be a change in man; there can be none in God; his bow is bent,
his arrows are ready, if the wicked do not turn (Psalm 7:11). There is not an atheist, an hypocrite, a
profane person, that ever was upon the earth, but God’s soul abhorred him as such, and the like he will
abhor forever; while any therefore continue so, they may sooner expect the heavens should roll as they
please, the sun stand still at their order, the stars change their course at their beck, than that God should
change his nature, which is opposite to profaneness and vanity; “Who hath hardened himself against him,
and hath prospered?” (Job 9:4.)
</p>
<p>
     Use 2. Of comfort. The immutability of a good God is a strong ground of consolation. Subjects wish a
good prince to live forever, as being loth to change him, but care not how soon they are rid of an
oppressor. This unchangeableness of God’s will shows him as ready to accept any that come to him as
ever he was; so that we may with confidence make our address to him, since he cannot change his
affections to goodness. The fear of change in a friend hinders a full reliance upon him; an assurance of
stability encourages hope and confidence. This attribute is the strongest prop for faith in all our addresses;
it is not a single perfection, but the glory of all those that belong to his nature; for he is unchangeable in
his love (Jer. 31:3), in his truth (Psalm 117:2). The more solemn revelation of himself in this name,
Jehovah, which signifies chiefly his eternity and immutability, was to support the Israelites’ faith in
expectation of a deliverance from Egypt, that he had not retracted his purpose, and his promise made to
Abraham for giving Canaan to his posterity (Exod. 3:14–17). Herein is the basis and strength of all his
promises; therefore, saith the Psalmist, “Those that know thy name, will put their trust in thee” (Psalm
9:10): those that are spiritually acquainted with thy name, Jehovah, and have a true sense of it upon their
hearts, will put their trust in thee. His goodness could not be distrusted, if his unchangeableness were well
apprehended and considered. All distrust would fly before it, as darkness before the sun; it only gets
advantage of us when we are not well grounded in his name; and if ever we trusted God, we have the
same reason to trust him forever: (Isa. 26:4) “Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah is
everlasting strength;” or, as it is in the Hebrew, “a Rock of Ages,” that is, perpetually unchangeable. We
find the traces of God’s immutability in the creatures. He has, by his peremptory decree, set bounds to the
sea: “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed” (Job 38:11). Do
we fear the sea overflowing us in this island? No, because of his fixed decree. And is not his promise in
his Word as unchangeable as his word concerning inanimate things, as good a ground to rest upon?
</p>
<p>
     1. The covenant stands unchangeable. Mutable creatures break their leagues and covenants, and snap
them asunder like Samson’s cords, when they are not accommodated to their interests. But an
unchangeable God keeps his: “The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness
shall not depart from thee, nor shall the covenant of my peace be removed” (Isa. 54:10). The heaven and
earth shall sooner fall asunder, and the strongest and firmest parts of the creation crumble to dust, sooner
than one iota of my covenant shall fail. It depends upon the unchangeableness of his will and the
unchangeableness of his word, and, therefore, is called “the immutability of his counsel” (Heb. 6:17). It is
the fruit of the everlasting purpose of God; whence the apostle links purpose and grace together (2 Tim.
1:9). A covenant with a nation may be changeable, because it may not be built upon the eternal purpose of
God, “to put his fear in the heart;” but with respect to the creature’s obedience. Thus God chose Jerusalem
as the place wherein he would “dwell forever” (Psalm 132:14), yet he threatens to depart from them when
they had broken covenant with him; “and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city to the
mountain on the east side” (Ezek. 11:33). The covenant of grace doth not run, “I will be your God if you
will be my people;” but “I will be their God, and they shall be my people” (Hos. 2:19, &amp;c.) “I will betroth
thee to me forever; I, will say, Thou art my people, and they shall say, Thou art my God.” His everlasting
purpose is, to write his laws in the hearts of the elect. He puts a condition to his covenant of grace, the
condition of faith, and he resolves to work that condition in the hearts of the elect; and, therefore,
believers have two immutable pillars for their support, stronger than those erected by Solomon at the
porch of the temple (1 Kings 7:21), called Jakin and Boaz, to note the firmness of that building dedicated
to God; these are election, or the standing. counsel of God, and the covenant of grace. He will not revoke
the covenant, and blot the names of his elect out of the book of life.
</p>
<p>
    2. Perseverance is ascertained. It consists not with the majesty of God to call a person effectually to
himself to-day, to make him fit for his eternal love, to give him faith, and take away that faith to-morrow.
His effectual call is the fruit of his eternal election, and that counsel hath no other foundation but his
constant and unchangeable will; a foundation that stands sure, and, therefore, called the foundation of
God, and not of the creature; “the foundation of God stands sure, the Lord knows who are his” (2 Tim.
2:19). It is not founded upon our own natural strength; it may be then subject to change, as all the
products of nature are. The fallen angels had created grace in their innocency, but lost it by their fall.
Were this the foundation of the creature, it might soon be shaken; since man, after his revolt, can ascribe
nothing constant to himself, but his own inconstancy. But the foundation is not in the infirmity of nature,
but the strength of grace, and of the grace of God, who is immutable, who wants not virtue to be able, nor
kindness to be willing, to reserve his own foundation.629 To what purpose doth our Saviour tell his
disciples their names “were written in heaven” (Luke 10:20), but to mark the infallible certainty of their
salvation by an opposition to those things which perish, and have their “names written in the earth” (Jer.
17:23); or upon the sand, where they may be defaced? And why should Christ order his disciples to
rejoice that their names were written in heaven, if God were changeable to blot them out again? or why
should the apostle assure us, that though God had rejected the greatest part of the Jews, he had not,
therefore, rejected his people elected according to his purpose and immutable counsel; because there are
none of the elect of God but will come to salvation? For, saith he, the “election hath obtained it” (Rom.
11:7); that is, all those that are of the election have obtained it, and the others are hardened. Where the
seal of sanctification is stamped, it is a testimony of God’s election, and that foundation shall stand sure:
“The foundation of the Lord stands sure, having this seal, the Lord knows who are his;” that is the
foundation, the “naming the name of Christ,” or believing in Christ, and “departing from iniquity,” is the
seal.630 As it is impossible when God calls those things that are not, but that they should spring up into
being and appear before him; so it is impossible but that the seed of God, by his eternal purpose, should
be brought to a spiritual life, and that calling cannot be retracted; for that “gift and calling is without
repentance” (Rom. 11:29). And when repentance is removed from God in regard of some works, the
immutability of those works is declared; and the reason of that immutability is their pure dependence on
the eternal favor and unchangeable grace of God “purposed in himself” (Eph. 1:9, 11), and not upon the
mutability of the creature. Hence their happiness is not as patents among men, quam diu bene se
gesserint, so long as they behave themselves well; but they have a promise that they shall behave
themselves so as never wholly to depart from God (Jer. 32:40): “I will make an everlasting covenant with
them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they
shall not depart from me.” God will not turn from them, to do them good, and promiseth that they shall
not turn from him forever, or forsake him. And the bottom of it is the everlasting covenant, and, therefore,
believing and sealing for security are linked together (Eph. 1:13). And when God doth inwardly teach us
his law, he puts in a will not to depart from it: (Psalm 119:102) “I have not departed from thy judgments;”
what is the reason? “For thou hast taught me.”
</p>
<p>
    3. By this eternal happiness is insured. This is the inference made from the eternity and
unchangeableness of God in the verse following the text (ver. 28): “The children of thy servants shall
continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.” This is the sole conclusion drawn from those
perfections of God solemnly asserted before. The children which the prophets and apostles have begotten
to thee, shall be totally delivered from the relics of their apostasy, and the punishment due to them, and
rendered partakers of immortality with thee, as sons to dwell in their Father’s house forever. The Spirit
begins a spiritual life here, to fit for an immutable life in glory hereafter, where believers shall be placed
upon a throne that cannot be shaken, and possess a crown that shall not be taken off their heads forever.
</p>
<p>
    Use 3. Of exhortation. 1. Let a sense of the changeableness and uncertainty of all other things beside
God, be upon us. There are as many changes as there are figures in the world. The whole fashion of the
world is a transient thing; every man may say as Job, “Changes and war are against me” (Job 10:17). Lot
chose the plain of Sodom, because it was the richer soil. He was but a little tine there before he was taken
prisoner, and his substance made the spoil of his enemies. That is again restored; but a while after, fire
from heaven devours his wealth, though his person was secured from the judgment by a special
Providence. We burn with a desire to settle ourselves, but mistake the way, and build castles in the air,
which vanish like bubbles of soap in water. And, therefore,
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Let not our thoughts dwell much upon them. Do but consider those souls that are in the possession
of an unchangeable God, that behold his never-fading glory! Would it not be a kind of hell to them to
have their thoughts starting out to these things, or find any desire in themselves to the changeable trifles
of the earth? Nay, have we not reason to think that they cover their faces with shame, that ever they
should have such a weakness of spirit when they were here below, as to spend more thoughts upon them
than were necessary for this present life; much more that they should at any time value and court them
above an unchangeable good? Do they not disdain themselves that they should ever debase the immutable
perfections of God, as to have neglecting thoughts of him at any time, for the entertainment of such a
mean and inconstant rival?
</p>

    (2.) Much less should we trust in them, or rejoice in them. The best things are mutable, and things of
such a nature are not fit objects of confidence. Trust not in riches, they have their wanes as well as
increases; they rise sometimes like a torrent, and flow in upon men, but resemble also a torrent in as
sudden a fall and departure, and leave nothing but slime behind them. Trust not in honor; all the honor
and applause in the world is no better than an inheritance of wind, which the pilot is not sure of, but shifts
from one corner to another, and stands not perpetually in the same point of the heavens. How, in a few
ages did the house of David, a great monarch, and a man after God’s own heart, descend to a mean
condition, and all the glory of that house shut up in the stock of a carpenter? David’s sheep-hook was
turned into a seeptre, and the sceptre by the same hand of Providence turned into a hatchet in Joseph his
descendant. Rejoice not immoderately in wisdom; that, and learning languish with age. A wound in the
head may impair that which is the glory of man. If an organ be out of frame, folly may succeed, and all a
man’s prudence be wound up in an irrecoverable dotage. Nebuchadnezzar was no fool, yet, by a sudden
hand of God, he became not only a fool or a madman, but a kind of brute. Rejoice not in strength; that
decays, and a mighty man may live to see his strong arm withered, and a grasshopper to become a burthen
(Eccles. 12:5): “The strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders shall cease because they are few”
(ver. 3): nor rejoice in children; they are like birds upon a tree, that make a little chirping music, and
presently fall into the fowler’s net. Little did Job expect such sad news as the loss of all his progeny at a
blow, when the messenger knocked at his gate; and such changes happen oftentimes when our
expectations of comfort, and a contentment in them, are at the highest. How often doth a string crack
when the musician hath wound it up to a just height for a tune, and all his pains and delight marred in a
moment! Nay, all these things change while we are using them, like ice that melts between our fingers,
and flowers that wither while we are smelling to them. The apostle gave them a good title when he called
them “uncertain riches,” and thought it a strong argument to dissuade them from trusting in them (1 Tim.
6:17). The wealth of the merchant depends upon the winds and waves, and the revenue of the
husbandman upon the clouds; and since they depend upon those things which are used to express the most
changeableness, they can be no fit object for trust. Besides, God sometimes kindles a fire under all a
man’s glory, which doth insensibly consume it (Isa. 10:16); and while we have them, the fear of losing
them renders us not very happy in the fruition of them; we can scarce tell whether they are contentments
or no, because sorrow follows them so close at the heels. It is not an unnecessary exhortation for good
men; the best men have been apt to place too much trust in them. David thought himself immutable in his
prosperity, and such thoughts could not be without some immoderate outlets of the heart to them, and
confidences in them; and Job promised himself to die in his nest, and “multiply his days as the sand,”
without any interruption (Job 29:18, 19, &amp;c.); but he was mistaken and disappointed. Let me add this:
trust not in men, who are as inconstant as anything else, and often change their most ardent affections into
implacable hatred; and though their affections may not be changed, the power to help you may. Haman’s
friends, that depended on him one day, were crest-fallen the next, when their patron was to exchange his
chariot of state for an ignominious gallows.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) Prefer an immutable God before mutable creatures. Is it not a horrible thing to see what we are,
and what we possess, daily crumbling to dust, and in a continual flux from us, and not seek out something
that is permanent, and always abide the same, for our portion? In God, or Wisdom, which is Christ, there
is substance (Prov. 8:21), in which respect he is opposed to all the things in the world, that are but
shadows, that are shorter or longer, according to the motion of the sun; mutable also, by every little body
that intervenes. God is subject to no decay within, to no force without; nothing in his own nature can
change him from what he is, and there is no power above can hinder him from being what he will to the
soul. He is an ocean of all perfection: he wants nothing without himself to render him blessed, which may
allure him to a change. His creatures can want nothing out of him to make them happy, whereby they may
be enticed to prefer anything before him. If we enjoy other things, it is by God’s donation, who can as
well withdraw them as bestow them; and it is but a reasonable, as well as a necessary thing, to endeavor
the enjoyment of the immutable Benefactor, rather than his revocable gifts. If the creatures had a
sufficient virtue in themselves to ravish our thoughts and engross our souls; yet when we take a prospect
of a fixed and unchangeable Being, what beauty, what strength have any of those things to vie with him?
How can they bear up and maintain their interest against a lively thought and sense of God? All the glory
of them would fly before him like that of the stars before the sun. They were once nothing, they may be
nothing again; as their own nature brought them not out of nothing, so their nature secures them not from
being reduced to nothing. What an unhappiness is it to have our affections set upon that which retains
something of its non esse with its esse, its not being with its being; that lives indeed, but in a continual
flux, and may lose that pleasurableness to-morrow which charms us to-day?
</p>
<p>
     2. This doctrine will teach us patience under such providences as declare his unchangeable will. The
rectitude of our wills consists in conformity to the Divine, as discovered in his words, and manifested in
his providence, which are the effluxes of his immutable will. The time of trial is appointed by his
immutable will (Dan. 11:35); it is not in the power of the sufferer’s will to shorten it, nor in the power of
the enemies’ will to lengthen it. Whatsoever doth happen hath been decreed by God (Eccles. 6:10), “That
which hath been is named already;” therefore to murmur or be discontented is to contend with God, who
is mightier than we, to maintain his own purposes. God doth act all things conveniently for that
immutable end intended by himself, and according to the reason of his own will, in the true point of time
most proper for it and for us, not too soon or too slow, because he is unchangeable in knowledge and
wisdom. God doth not act anything barely by an immutable will, but by an immutable wisdom, and an
unchangeable rule of goodness; and, therefore, we should not only acquiesce in what he works, but have a
complacency in it; and by having our wills thus knitting themselves with the immutable will of God, we
attain some degree of likeness to him in his own unchangeableness. When, therefore, God hath manifested
his will in opening his decree to the world by his work of providence, we must cease all disputes against
it, and, with Aaron hold our peace, though the affliction be very smart (Rev. 10:3). “All flesh must be
silent before God” (Zech. 2:13); for whatsoever is his counsel shall stand, and cannot be recalled. All
struggling against it is like a brittle glass contending with a rock; for “if he cut off and shut up, or gather
together, then who can hinder him?” (Job 11:10.) Nothing can help us, if he hath determined to afflict us,
as nothing can hurt us, if he hath determined to secure us. The more clearly God hath evidenced this or
that to be his will, the more sinful is our struggling against it. Pharaoh’s sin was the greater in keeping
Israel, by how much the more God’s miracles had been demonstrations of his settled will to deliver them.
Let nothing snatch our hearts to a contradiction to him, but let us fear and give glory to him, when the
hour of judgment which he hath appointed is come (Rev. 14:7); that is, comply with the unchangeable
will of his precept, the more he declares the immutable will of his providence. We must not think God
must disgrace his nature and change his proceedings for us; better the creature should suffer, than God be
impaired in any of his perfections. If God changed his purpose he would change his nature. Patience is the
way to perform the immutable will of God, and a means to attain a gracious immutability for ourselves by
receiving the promise (Heb. 10:36), “Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye
might receive the promise.”
</p>
<p>
     3. This doctrine will teach us to imitate God in this perfection, by striving to be immovable in
goodness. God never goes back from himself; he finds nothing better than himself for which he should
change; and can we find anything better than God, to allure our hearts to a change from him? The sun
never declines from the ecliptic line, nor should we from the paths of holiness. A steadfast obedience is
encouraged by an unchangeable God to reward it (1 Cor. 15:58): “Be steadfast and immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.”
Unsteadfastness is the note of a hypocrite (Psalm 78:37): steadfastness in that which is good is the mark
of a saint; it is the character of a righteous person to “keep the truth” (Isa. 26:2). And it is as positively
said that “he that abides not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God” (2 John 9); but he that doth, “hath both
the Father and the Son.” So much of uncertainty, so much of nature, so much of firmness in duty, so much
of grace. We can never honor God unless we finish his work; as Christ did not glorify God but in
finishing the work God gave him to do (John 17:4). The nearer the world comes to an end, the more is
God’s immutability seen in his promises and predictions, and the more must our unchangeableness be
seen in our obedience (Heb. 10:23, 25): “Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, and
so much the more as you see the day approaching.” The christian Jews were to be the more tenacious of
their faith, the nearer they saw the day approaching, the day of Jerusalem’s destruction prophesied of by
Daniel (Dan. 9:26), which accomplishment must be a great argument to establish the christian Jews in the
profession of Christ to be the Messiah, because the destruction of the city was not to be before the cutting
off the Messiah. Let us be, therefore, constant in our profession and service of God, and not suffer
ourselves to be driven from him by the ill usage, or flattered from him by the caresses of the world.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) It is reasonable. If God be unchangeable in doing us good, it is reason we should be unchangeable
in doing him service. If he assure us that he is our God, our “I Am,” he would also that we should be his
people; his we are. If he declare himself constant in his promises, he expects we should be so in our
obedience. As a spouse, we should be unchangeably faithful to him as a Husband; as subjects, have an
unchangeable allegiance to him as our Prince. He would not have us faithful to him for an hour or a day,
but “to the death” (Rev. 2:10); and it is reason we should be his, and if we be his children, imitate him in
his constancy of his holy purposes.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) It is our glory and interest. To be a reed shaken with every wind is no commendation among men,
and it is less a ground of praise with God. It was Job’s glory that he held fast his integrity (Job 1:22): “In
all this Job sinned not;” in all this,—which whole cities and kingdoms would have thought ground enough
of high exclamations against God, and also against the temptation of his wife,—he retained his integrity
(Job 2:9): “Dost thou still retain thy integrity?” The devil, who by God’s permission stripped him of his
goods and health, yet could not strip him of his grace. As a traveller, when the wind and snow beats in his
face, wraps his cloak more closely about him to preserve that and himself. Better we had never made
profession, than afterwards to abandon it; such a withering profession serves for no other use than to
aggravate the crime, if any of us fly like a coward, or revolt like a traitor; what profit will it be to a
soldier, if he hath withstood many assaults, and turn his back at last? If we would have God crown us with
an immutable glory, we must crown our beginnings with a happy perseverance (Rev. 2:10): “Be faithful
to the death, and I will give thee a crown of life;” not as though this were the cause to merit it, but a
necessary condition to possess it: constancy in good is accompanied with an immutability of glory.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) By an unchangeable disposition to good, we should begin the happiness of heaven upon earth.
This is the perfection of blessed spirits, those that are nearest to God as angels and glorified souls, they
are immutable; not, indeed, by nature, but by grace; yet not only by a necessity of grace, but a liberty of
will: grace will not let them change; and that grace doth animate their wills that they would not change; an
immutable God fills their understandings and affections, and gives satisfaction to their desires. The saints
when they were below, tried other things, and found them deficient; but now they are so fully satisfied
with the beatific vision, that if Satan should have an entrance among the angels and sons of God, it is not
likely he should have any influence upon them; he could not present to their understandings anything that
could either at the first glance, or upon a deliberate view, be preferable to what they enjoy and are fixed
in. Well, then, let us be immovable in the knowledge and love of God. It is the delight of God to see his
creatures resemble him in what they are able. Let not our affections to him be as Jonah’s gourd, growing
up in one night and withering the next. Let us not only fight a good fight, but do so till we have finished
our course, and imitate God in an unchangeableness of holy purposes; and to that purpose, examine
ourselves daily what fixedness we have arrived unto; and to prevent any temptation to a revolt, let us
often possess our minds with thoughts of the immutability of God’s nature and will, which, like fire under
water, will keep a good matter boiling up in us, and make it both retain and increase its heat.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) Let this doctrine teach us to have recourse to God, and aim at a near conjunction with him. When
our spirits begin to flag, and a cold aguish temper is drawing upon us, let us go to him who can only fix
our hearts, and furnish us with a ballast to render them steadfast. As he is only immutable in his nature, so
he is the only principle of immutability, as well as being in the creature. Without his grace, we shall be as
changeable in our appearances as the chameleon, and in our turnings as the wind. When Peter trusted in
himself, he changed to the worse; it was his Master’s recourse to God for him that preserved in him a
reducing principle, which changed him again for the better, and fixed him in it (Luke 22:32). It will be our
interest to be in conjunction with him, that moves not about with the heavens, nor is turned by the force of
nature, nor changed by the accidents in the world; but sits in the heavens, moving all things by his
powerful arm, according to his infinite skill. While we have him for our God, we have his immutability as
well as any other perfection of his nature for our advantage; the nearer we come to him, the more stability
we shall have in ourselves; the further from him, the more liable to change. The line that is nearest to the
place where it is first fixed, is least subject to motion; the further it is stretched from it, the weaker it is,
and more liable to be shaken. Let us also affect those things which are nearest to him in this perfection;
the righteousness of Christ that shall never wear out, and the graces of the Spirit that shall never burn out;
by this means, what God is infinitely by nature, we shall come to be finitely immutable by grace, as much
as the capacity of a creature can contain.

<h1 class="caption">DISCOURSE VII - ON GOD’S OMNIPRESENCE</h1>
<blockquote>
Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him! saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
<div class="sig">JEREMIAH 23:24</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
    THE occasion of this discourse begins ver. 16, where God admonisheth the people, not to hearken to
the words of the false prophets which spake a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the
Lord. They made the people vain by their insinuations of peace, when God had proclaimed war and
calamity; and uttered the dreams of their fancies, and not the visions of the Lord; and so turned the people
from the expectation of the evil day which God had threatened (ver. 17): “They say still unto them that
despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have peace: and they say unto every one that walks after the
imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.” And they invalidate the prophecies of those
whom God had sent, ver. 18: “Who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and heard
his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?” Who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord? Are they
acquainted with the secrets of God more than we? Who have the word of the Lord, if we have not? Or, it
may be a continuation of God’s admonition: believe not those prophets; for who of them have been
acquainted with the secrets of God? or by what means should they learn his counsel? No; assure
yourselves “a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind; it shall fall
grievously upon the head of the wicked” (ver. 19). A whirlwind shall come from Babylon; it is just at the
door, and shall not be blown over; it shall fall with a witness upon the wicked people and the deceiving
prophets, and sweep them together into captivity. For (ver. 20), “The anger of the Lord shall not return,
until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart.” My fury shall not be a
childish fury, that quickly languisheth, but shall accomplish whatsoever I threaten; and burn so hot, as not
to be cool, till I have satisfied my vengeance; “in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly” (ver. 20),
when the storm shall beat upon you, you shall then know that the calamities shall answer the words you
have heard. When the conqueror shall waste your grounds, demolish your houses, and manacle your
hands, then shall you consider it, and have the wishes of fools, that you had had your eyes in your heads
before; you shall then know the falseness of your guides, and the truth of my prophets, and discern who
stood in the counsel of the Lord, and subscribe to the messages I have sent you.
</p>
<p>
    Some understand this not only of the Babylonish captivity, but refer it to the time of Christ, and the
false doctrine of men s own righteousness in opposition to the righteousness of God; understanding this
verse to be partly a threatening of wrath, which shall end in an advantage to the Jews, who shall in the
latter time consider the falseness of their notions about a legal righteousness, and so make it a promise;
they shall then know the intent of the Scripture, and in the latter days, the latter end of the world, when
time shall be near the rolling up, they shall reflect upon themselves; they shall “look upon Him whom
they have pierced;” and till these latter days, they shall be hardened, and believe nothing of evangelical
truths. Now God denieth that he sent those prophets (ver. 21): “I have not sent these prophets, yet they
ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.” They have intruded themselves without a
commission from me, whatsoever their brags are. The reason to prove it is (ver. 22), “If they had stood in
my counsel,” if they had been instructed, and inspired by me, “they would have caused my people to hear
my words;” they would have regulated themselves according to my word, “and have turned them from
their evil way;” i. e. endeavored to shake down their false confidences of peace, and make them sensible
of their false notions of me, and my ways. Now because those false prophets could not be so impudent as
to boast that they prophesied in the name of God, when they had not commission from him, unless they
had some secret sentiment, that they and their intentions were hid from the knowledge and eye of God; he
adds (ver. 33), “Am I a God at hand, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places, that I
shall not see him? Have I not the power of seeing and knowing what they do, what they design, what they
think? Why should I not have such a power, since I fill heaven and earth by my essence?” Am I a God at
hand, and not a God afar off? He excludes here the doctrine of those that excluded the providence of God
from extending itself to the inferior things of the earth; which error was ancient, as ancient as the time of
Job, as appears by their opinion, that God’s eyes were hood-winked and muffled by the thickness of the
clouds, and could not pierce through their dark and dense body (Job 22:14): “Thick clouds are a covering
to him, that he seeth not.”
</p>
<p>
     Some refer it to time.631 Do you imagine me a God new framed like your idols, beginning a little time
ago, and not existing before the foundation of the world; yea, from eternity? a God afar off, further than
your acutest understandings can reach? I am of a longer standing, and you ought to know my majesty. But
it rather refers to place than tine. Do you think I do not behold everything in the earth, as well as in
heaven? Am I locked up within the walls of my palace, and cannot peep out to behold the things done in
the world? or that am I so linked to pleasure in the place of my glory, as earthly kings are in their courts,
that I have no mind or leisure to take notice of the carriages of men upon earth?
</p>
<p>
     God doth not say, He was afar off, but only gives an account of the inward thoughts of their minds, or
at least of the language expressed by their actions. The interrogation carries in it a strong affirmation, and
assures us more of God’s care, and the folly of men in not considering it. “Am I a God at hand, and not a
God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places?” (Heb.) In hiddenesses, in the deepest cells. What I
are you besotted by your base lusts, that you think me a God careless, ignorant, blind, that I can see
nothing, but as a purblind man, what is very near my eye? Are you so out of your wits, that you imagine
you can deceive me? Do not all your behaviors speak such a sentiment to lie secret in your heart, though
not formed into a full conception, yet testified by your actions? No, you are much mistaken; it is
impossible but that I should see and know all things, since I am present with all things, and am not at a
greater distance from the things on earth than from the things in heaven; for I fill all that vast fabric which
is divided into those two parts of heaven and earth; and he that hath such an infinite essence, cannot lie
distant, cannot be ignorant; nothing can be far from his eyes, since everything is so near to his essence. So
that it is an elegant expression of the omniscience of God, and a strong argument for it. He asserts, first,
the universality of his knowledge; but lest they should mistake, and confine his presence only to heaven,
he adds, That he “fills heaven and earth.” I do not see things so, as if I were in one place, and the things
seen in another, as it is with man; but whatsoever I see, I see not without myself, because every corner of
heaven and earth is filled by me. He that fills all, must needs see and know all. And indeed, men that
question the knowledge of God, would be more convinced by the doctrine of his immediate presence with
them. And this seems to be the design and manner of arguing in this place. Nothing is remote from my
knowledge, because nothing is distant from my presence.
</p>
<p>
     I fill heaven and earth: he doth not say, “I am in heaven and earth,” but I fill heaven and earth; i. e. say
some, with my knowledge, others, with my authority or my power.632 But,
</p>
<p>
     1. The word filling cannot properly be referred to the act of understanding and will. A presence by
knowledge is to be granted, but to say such a presence fills a place is an improper speech: knowledge is
not enough to constitute a presence. A man at London knows there is such a city as Paris, and knows
many things in it; can he be concluded, therefore, to be present in Paris, or fill any place there, or be
present with the things he knows there? If I know anything to be distant from me, how can it be present
with me? For by knowing it to be distant, I know it not to be present. Besides, filling heaven and earth is
distinguished here from knowing or seeing: his presence is rendered as an argument to prove his
knowledge. Now a proposition, and the proof of that roposition, are distinct, and not the same. It cannot
be imagine that God should prove idem per idem, as we say; for what would be the import of the speech
then? I know all things, I see all things, because I know and see all things.633 The Holy Ghost here
accommodates himself to the capacity of men; because we know that a man sees and knows that which is
done, where he is corporally present; so he proves that God knows all things that are done in the most
secret caverns of the heart, because he is everywhere in heaven and earth, as light is everywhere in the air,
and air everywhere in the world. Hence the schools use the term repletive for the presence of God.
</p>
<p>
     2. Nor by filling of heaven and earth is meant his authority and power. It would be improperly said of
a king, that in regard of the government of his kingdom, is everywhere by his authority, that he fills all the
cities and countries of his dominions. “I, do not I fill?”634 That “I” notes the essence of God, as
distinguished according to our capacity, from the perfections pertaining to his essence, and is in reason
better referred to the substance of God, than to those things we conceive as attributes in him. Besides,
were it meant only of his authority or power, the argument would not run well. I see all things, because
my authority and power fills heaven and earth. Power doth not always rightly infer knowledge, no, not in
a rational agent. Many things in a kingdom are done by the authority of the king, that never arrive to the
knowledge of the king. Many things in us are done. by the power of our souls, which yet we have not a
distinct knowledge of in our understandings. There are many motions in sleep, by the virtue of the soul
informing the body, that we have not so much as a simple knowledge of in our minds. Knowledge is not
rightly inferred from power, or power from knowledge. By filling heaven and earth is meant, therefore, a
filling it with his essence. No place can be imagined that is deprived of the presence of God; and therefore
when the Scripture anywhere speaks of the presence of God, it joins heaven and earth together. He so fills
them, that there is no place without him. We do not say a vessel is full so long as there is any space to
contain more. Not a part of heaven, nor a part of earth, but the whole heaven, the whole earth, at one and
the same time. If he were only in one part of heaven, or one part of earth; nay, if there were any part of
heaven, or any part of earth void of him, he could not be said to fill them. “I fill heaven and earth,” not a
part of me fills one place, and another part of me fills another, but I, God, fill heaven and earth; I am
whole God filling the heaven, and whole God, filling the earth. I fill heaven, and yet fill earth; I fill earth,
and yet fill heaven, and fill heaven and earth at one and the same time. “God fills his own works,” a
heathen philosopher saith.635
</p>
<p>
     I. Here is then a description of God’s presence. 1. By power, “Am I not a God afar off?” a God in the
extension of his arm. 2. By knowledge, “Shall I not see them?” 3. By essence; as an undeniable ground
for inferring the two former: “I fill heaven and earth.”
</p>
<p>
     Doctrine. God is essentially everywhere present in heaven and earth. If God be, he must be
somewhere; that which is nowhere, is nothing. Since God is, he is in the world; not in one part of it; for
then he were circumscribed by it: if in the world, and only there, though it be a great space, he were also
limited. Some therefore said, “God was everywhere, and nowhere.”636 Nowhere, i. e. not bounded by any
place, nor receiving from any place anything for his preservation or sustainment. He is everywhere,
because no creature, either body or spirit, can exclude the presence of his essence; for he is not only near,
but in everything (Acts 17:28) “In him we live, and move, and have our being.” Not absent from
anything, but so present with them, that they live and move in him, and move more in God, than in the air
or earth wherein they are; nearer to us than our flesh to our bones, than the air to our breath; he cannot be
far from them that live, and have every motion in him. The apostle doth not say, By him, but in him, to
show the inwardness of his presence. As eternity is the perfection whereby he hath neither beginning nor
end, immutability is the perfection whereby he hath neither increase nor diminution, so immensity or
omnipresence is that whereby he hath neither bounds nor limitation. As he is in all time, yet so as to be
above time; so is he in all places, yet so as to be above limitation by any place. It was a good expression
of a heathen to illustrate this, “That God is a sphere or circle, whose centre is everywhere, and
circumference nowhere.” His meaning was, that the essence of God was indivisible; i. e. could not be
divided. It cannot be said, here and there the lines of it terminate; it is like a line drawn out in infinite
spaces, that no point can be conceived where its length and breadth ends. The sea is a vast mass of waters;
yet to that it is said, “Hitherto shalt thou go, and no further.” But it cannot be said of God’s essence,
hitherto it reaches, and no further; here it is, and there it is not. It is plain, that God is thus immense,
because he is infinite; we have reason and Scripture to assent to it, though we cannot conceive it. We
know that God is eternal, though eternity is too great to be measured by the short line of a created
understanding. We cannot conceive the vastness and glory of the heavens, much less that which is so
great, as to fill heaven and earth, yea (1 Kings 8:27), “not to be contained in the heaven of Heavens.”
Things are said to be present, or in a place,
</p>
<p>
     1. Circumscriptive, as circumscribed. This belongs to things that have quantity, as bodies that are
encompassed by that place wherein they are; and a body fills but one particular space wherein it is, and
the space is commensurate to every part of it, and every member hath a distinct place. The hand is not in
the same particular space that the foot or head is.
</p>
<p>
     2. Definitive, which belongs to angels and spirits, which are said to be in a point, yet so as that they
cannot be said to be in another at the same time.
</p>
<p>
     3. Repletive, filling all places. This belongs only to God: as he is not measured by time, so he is not
limited by place. A body or spirit, because finite, fills but one space; God, because infinite, fills all, yet so
as not to be contained in them, as wine and water is in a vessel. He is from the height of the heavens to the
bottom of the deeps, in every point of the world, and in the whole circle of it, yet not limited by it, but
beyond it. Now this hath been acknowledged by the wisest in the world. Some indeed had other notions of
God. The more ignorant sort of the Jews confined him to the temple.637 And God intimates, that they had
such a thought when he asserts his presence in heaven and earth, in opposition to the temple they built as
his house, and the place of his rest.638 And the idolaters among them, thought their gods might be at a
distance from them, which Elias intimates in the scoff he puts upon them (1 Kings 18:17), “Cry aloud, for
he is a god,” meaning Baal; “either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey;” and they
followed his advice, and cried louder (ver. 28), whereby it is evident, they looked not on it as a mock, but
as a truth. And the Syrians called the God of Israel the God of the hills, as though his presence were fixed
there, and not in the valleys (1 Kings 10:23); and their own gods in the valleys, and not in the mountains;
they fancied every god to have a particular dominion and presence in one place and not in another, and
bounded the territories of their gods as they did those of their princes.639 And some thought him tied to
and shut up in their temples and groves wherein they worshipped him.640 Some of them thought God to be
confined to heaven, and therefore sacrificed upon the highest mountains, that the steam might ascend
nearer heaven, and their praises be heard better in those places which were nearest to the habitation of
God. But the wiser Jews acknowledged it, and therefore called God place,641 whereby they denoted his
immensity; he was not contained in any place; every part of the world subsists by Him: he was a place to
himself, greater than anything made by Him. And the wiser heathens acknowledged it also. One calls God
a mind passing through the universal nature of things;642 another, that He was an infinite and immense
air;643 another, that it is as natural to think God is everywhere, as to think that God is: hence they called
God the soul of the world; that as the soul is in every part of the body to quicken it, so is God in every
part of the world to support it. And there are some resemblances of this in the world, though no creature
can fully resemble God in any one perfection; for then it would not be a creature, but God. But air and
light are some resemblances of it: air is in all the spaces of the world, in the pores of all bodies, in the
bowels of the earth, and extends itself from the lowest earth to the highest regions; and the heavens
themselves are probably nothing else but a refined kind of air; and light diffuseth itself through the whole
air, and every part of it is truly light, as every part of the air is truly air; and though they seem to be
mingled together, yet they are distinct things, and not of the same essence; so is the essence of God in the
whole world, not by diffusion as air or light, not mixed with any creature, but remaining distinct from the
essence of any created being. Now, when this hath been owned by men instructed only in the school of
nature, it is a greater shame to any acquainted with the Scripture to deny. For the understanding of this,
there shall be some propositions premised in general.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. I. This is negatively to be understood. Our knowledge of God is most by withdrawing from him,
or denying to him in our conceptions any weaknesses or imperfections in the creature. As the infiniteness
of God is a denial of limitation of being, so immensity or omnipresence is a denial of limitation of place:
and when we say, God is totus in every place, we must understand it thus; that he is not everywhere by
parts, as bodies are, as air and light are; He is everywhere, i. e. his nature hath no bounds; he is not tied to
any place, as the creature is, who, when he is present in one place, is absent from another. As no place can
be without God, so no place can compass and contain him.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. II. There is an influential omnipresence of God.
</p>
<p>
     1. Universal with all creatures. He is present with all things by his authority, because all things are
subject to him by his power, because all things are sustained by him: by his knowledge, because all things
are naked before him. He is present in the world, as a king is in all parts of his kingdom regally present:
providentially present with all, since his care extends to the meanest of his creatures. His power reacheth
all, and his knowledge pierceth all. As everything in the world was created by God, so everything in the
word is preserved by God; and since preservation is not wholly distinct from creation, it is necessary God
should be present with everything while he preserves it, as well as present with it when he created it.
“Thou preservest man and beast” (Psalm 36:6). “He upholds all things by the word of his power” (Heb.
1:3). There is a virtue sustaining every creature, that it may not fall back into that nothing from whence it
was elevated by the power of God. All those natural virtues we call the principles of operation, are
fountains springing from his goodness and power; all things are acted and managed by him, as well as
preserved by him; and in this sense God is present with all creatures; for whatsoever acts another, is
present with that which it acts, by sending forth some virtue and influence whereby it acts: if free agents
do not only live, but move in him and by him (Acts 17:28), much more are the motions of other natural
agents by a virtue communicated to them, and upheld in them in the time of their acting. This virtual
presence of God is evident to our sense, a presence we feel; his essential presence is evident in our reason.
This influential presence may be compared to that of the sun, which though at so great a distance from the
earth, is present in the air and earth by its light, and within the earth by its influence in concocting those
metals which are in the bowels of it, without being substantially either of them. God is thus so intimate
with every creature, that there is not the least particle of any creature, but the marks of his power and
goodness are seen in it, and his goodness doth attend them, and is more swift in its effluxes than the
breakings out of light from the sun, which yet are more swift than can be declared; but to say he is in the
world only by his virtue, is to acknowledge only the effects of his power and wisdom in the world, that
his eye sees all, his arm supports all, his goodness nourisheth all, but himself and his essence at a distance
from them;644 and so the soul of man according to its measure would have in some kind a more excellent
manner of presence in the body, than God according to the infiniteness of his Being with his creatures; for
that doth not only communicate life to the body, but is actually present with it, and spreads its whole
essence through the body and every member of it. All grant, that God is efficaciously in every creek of the
world; but some say he is only substantially in heaven.
</p>
<p>
     2. Limited to such subjects that are capacitated for this or that kind of presence. Yet it is an
omnipresence, because it is a presence in all the subjects capacitated for it; thus there is a special
providential presence of God with some in assisting them when he sets them on work as his instruments
for some special service in the world. As with Cyrus (Isa. 45:2), “I will go before thee;” and with
Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, whom he protected and directed to execute his counsels in the world;
such a presence Judas and others645 that shall not enjoy his glorious presence, had in the working of
miracles in the world. Besides,646 as there is an effective presence of God with all creatures, because he
produced them and preserves them, so there is an objective presence of God with rational creatures,
because he offers himself to them to be known and loved by them. He is near to wicked men in the offers
of his grace, “Call ye upon him while he is near” (Isa. 55:6); besides, there is a gracious presence of God
with his people in whom he dwells and makes his abode, as in a temple consecrated to him by the graces
of the Spirit. “We will come” (John 14:23), i. e. the Father and the Son, and make our abode with him. He
is present with all by the presence of his Divinity, but only in his saints by a presence of a gracious
efficacy; he walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks, and hath dignified the congregation of his
people with the title of Jehovah Shammah, “the Lord is there” (Ezek.48:35): “in Salem is his tabernacle,
and his dwelling place in Sion” (Psalm 76:2). As be filled the tabernacle, so he doth the church with the
signs of his presence; this is not the presence wherewith he fills heaven and earth. His Spirit is not
bestowed upon all to reside in their hearts, enlighten their minds, and bedew them with refreshing
comforts. When the Apostle speaks of God being “above all and through all” (Eph. 4:6), above all in his
majesty, through all in his providence; he doth not appropriate that as he doth what follows, “and in you
all;” in you all by a special grace; as God was specially present with Christ by the grace of union, so he is
specially present with his people by the grace of regeneration. So there are several manifestations of his
presence; he hath a presence of glory in heaven, whereby he comforts the saints; a presence of wrath in
hell, whereby he torments the damned; in heaven he is a God spreading his beams of light; in hell, a God
distributing his strokes of justice; by the one he fills heaven; by the other he fills hell; by his providence
and essence he fills both heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. III. There is an essential presence of God in the world. He is not only everywhere by his power
upholding the creatures, by his wisdom understanding them, but by his essence containing them. That
anything is essentially present anywhere, it hath from God; God is therefore much more present
everywhere, for he cannot give that which he hath not.
</p>
<p>
     1. He is essentially present in all places.647 It is as reasonable to think the essence of God to be
everywhere as to be always. Immensity is as rational as eternity. That indivisible essence which reaches
through all times may as well reach through all places. It is more excellent to be always than to be
everywhere; for to be always in duration is intrinsical; to be everywhere is intrinsic. If the greater belongs
to God, why not the less? As all times are a moment to his eternity, so all places are as a point to his
essence. As he is larger than all time, so he is vaster than all place. The nations of the world are to hire “as
the dust of the balance” or “drop of a bucket” (Isa. 40:15.). “The nations are accounted as the small dust.”
The essence of God may well be thought to be present everywhere with that which is no more than a grain
of dust to him, and in all those isles, which, if put together, “are a very little thing” in his hand. Therefore,
saith a learned Jew,648 if a man were set in the highest heavens he would not be nearer to the essence of
God than if he were in the centre of the earth. Why may not the presence of God in the world be as noble
as that of the soul in the body, which is generally granted to be essentially in every part of the. body of
man, which is but a little world, and animates every member by its actual presence, though it exerts not
the same operation in every part?649 The world is less to the Creator than the body to the soul, and needs
more the presence of God than the body needs the presence of the soul. That glorious body of the sun
visits every part of the habitable earth in twenty-four hours by its beams, which reaches the troughs of the
lowest valleys as well as the pinnacles of the highest mountains; must we not acknowledge in the Creator
of this sun an infinite greater proportion of presence? Is it not as easy, with the essence of God, to
overspread the whole body of heaven and earth as it is for the sun to pierce and diffuse itself through the
whole air, between it and the earth, and send up its light also as far to the regions above? Do we not see
something like it in sounds and voices? Is not the same sound of a trumpet, or any other musical
instrument, at the first breaking out of a blast, in several places within such a compass at the same time?
Doth not every ear that hears it receive alike the whole sound of it? And fragrant odors, scented in several
places at the same time, in the same manner; and the organ proper for smelling takes in the same in every
person within the compass of it. How far is the noise of thunder heard alike to every ear in places
something distant from one another! And do we daily find such a manner of presence in those things of so
low a concern, and not imagine a kind of presence of God greater than all those? Is the sound of thunder,
the voice of God as it is called, everywhere in such a compass? and shall not the essence of an infinite
God be much more everywhere? Those that would confine the essence of God only to heaven, and
exclude it from the earth, run into great inconveniences. It may be demanded whether he be in one part of
the heavens or in the whole vast body of them. If in one part of them, his essence is bounded; if he moves
from that part he is mutable, for he changes a place wherein he was, for another wherein he was not. If he
be always fixed in one part of the heavens, such a notion would render him little better than a living
statue.650 If he be in the whole heaven, why cannot his essence possess a greater space than the whole
heavens, which are so vast? How comes he to be confined within the compass of that, since the whole
heaven comppasseth the earth? If he be in the whole heaven he is in places farther distant one from
another than any part of the earth can be from the heavens; since the earth is like a centre in the midst of a
circle, it must be nearer to every part of the circle than some parts of the circle can be to one another. If,
therefore, his essence possesses the whole heavens, no reason can be rendered why he doth not also
possess the earth, since also the earth is but a little point in comparison of the vastness of the heavens: if,
therefore, he be in every part of the heavens, why not in every part of the earth? The Scripture is plain
(Psalm 139:7–9), “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I fly from thy presence? If I ascend
up to heaven, thou art there; if make my bed in hell, behold thou art there; if I take the wings of the
morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand
shall uphold me.” If he be in heaven, earth, hell, sea, he fills all places with his presence. His presence is
here asserted in places the most distant from one another. All the places then between heaven and earth
are possessed by his presence. It is not meant of his knowledge, for that the Psalmist had spoken of before
(ver. 2, 3), “Thou understandest my thoughts afar off; thou art acquainted with all my ways:” besides,
“thou art there;” not thy wisdom or knowledge, but thou, thy essence, not only thy virtue. For, having
before spoken of his omniscience, he proves that such knowledge could not be in God, unless he were
present in his essence in all places, so as to be excluded from none. He fills the depths of hell, the
extension of the earth, and the heights of the heavens. When the Scripture mentions the power of God
only, it expresseth it by hand or arm; but when it mentions the Spirit of God, and doth not intend the Third
Person in the Trinity, it signifies the nature and essence of God. And so here, when he saith, “Whither
shall I go from thy Spirit?” he adds, exegetically, “Whither shall I fly from thy presence?” or (Heb.)
“face:” and the face of God in Scripture signifies the essence of God (Exod. 33:20, 23); “Thou canst not
see my face,” and “My face shall not be seen.” The effects of his power, wisdom, and providence are
seen, which are his back parts, but not his face. The effects of his power and wisdom are seen in the
world, but his essence is invisible; and this the Psalmist elegantly expresseth, Had I wings endued with as
much quickness as the first dawnings of the morning light, or the first darts of any sunbeam that spreads
itself through the hemisphere, and passeth many miles in as short a space as I can think a thought, I
should find thy presence in all places before me, and could not fly out of the infinite compass of thy
essence.
</p>
<p>
     2. “He is essentially present with all creatures.” If he be in all places, it follows that he is with all
creatures in those places; as he is m heaven, so he is with all angels; as he is in hell, so he is with all
devils: as he is in the earth and sea, he is with all creatures inhabiting those elements; as his essential
presence was the ground of the first being of things by creation, so it is the ground of the continued being
of things by conservation; as his essential presence was the original, so it is the support of the existence of
all the creatures. What are all those magnificent expressions of his creative virtue, but testimonies of his
essential presence at the laying the foundation of the world (Isa. 40:12), “when he measured the waters in
the hollow of his band, meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?” He sets forth the power and
majesty of God in the creation and preservation of things, and every expression testifies his presence with
them. The waters that were upon the face of the earth at first were no more than a drop in the palm of a
man’s hand, which in every part is touched by his hand; and thus he is equally present with the blackest
devils, as well as the brightest angels; with the lowest dust, as well as with the most sparkling sun. He is
equally present with the damned and the blessed, as he is an infinite Being, but not in regard of his
goodness and grace. He is equally present with the good and the bad, with the scoffing Athenians, as well
as the believing apostles, in regard of his essence, but not in regard of the breathing of his divine virtues
upon them to make them like himself (Acts 17:27). “He is not far from every one of us; for in him we
live, and move, and have our being.” The apostle includes all; he tells them they should seek the Lord; the
Lord that they were to seek, is God essentially considered. We are, indeed, to seek the perfections of God,
that glitter in his works, but to the end that they should direct us to the seeking of God himself in his own
nature and essence;651 and, therefore, what follows, “In him we live,” is to be understood, not of his power
and goodness, perfections of his nature, distinguished according to our manner of conception from his
essence, but of the essential presence of God with his creatures. If he had meant it of his efficacy in
preserving us, it had not been any proof of his nearness to us. Who would go about to prove the body or
substance of the sun to be near us because it doth warm and enlighten us, when our sense evidenceth the
distance of it? We live in the beams of the sun, but we cannot be said to live in the sun, which is so far
distant from us. The expression seems to be more emphatical than to intend any less than his essential
presence; but we live in him not only as the efficient cause of our life, but as the foundation sustaining our
lives and motions, as if he were like air, diffused round about us; and we move in him, as Austin saith, as
a sponge in the sea, not containing him, but being contained by him. He compasseth all, is encompassed
by none; he fills all, is comprehended by none. The Creator contains the world, the world contains not the
Creator; as the hollow of the hand contains the water, the water in the hollow of the hand contains not the
hand; and therefore some have chose to say, rather, that the world is in God, it lives and moves in him,
than that God is in the world. If all things thus live and move in him, then he is present with everything
that hath life and motion; and as long as the devils and damned have life, and motion, and being, so long
is he with them; for whatsoever lives and moves, lives and moves in him. This essential presence is,
</p>
<p>
     (1) Without any mixture. I fill heaven and earth; not, I am mixed with heaven and earth: his essence is
not mixed with the creatures; it remains entire in itself. The sponge retains the nature of a sponge, though
encompassed by the sea, and moving in it; and the sea still retains its own nature. God is most simple; his
essence therefore is not mixed with anything. The light of the sun is present with the air, but not mixed
with it; it remains light, and the air remains air; the light of the sun is diffused through all the hemisphere,
it pierceth all transparent bodies, it seems to mix itself with all things, yet remains unmixed and
undivided; the light remains light, and the air remains air; the air is not light, though it be enlightened. Or,
take this similitude: When many candles are lighted up in a room, the light is all together, yet not mixed
with one another; every candle hath a particular light belonging to it, which may be separated in a
moment, by removing one candle from another; but if they were mixed, they could not be separated, at
least so easily. God is not formally one with the world, or with any creature in the world by his presence
in it; nor can any creature in the world, no, not the soul of man, or an angel, come to be essentially one
with God, though God be essentially present with it.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) The essential presence is without any division of himself. “I fill heaven and earth,” not part in
heaven, and part in earth; I fill one as well as the other: one part of his essence is not in one place, and
another part of his essence in another place, he would then be changeable; for that part of his essence
which were now in this place, he might alter it to another, and place that part of his essence which were in
another place to this; but he is undivided everywhere. As his eternity is one indivisible point, though in
our conception we divide it into past, present, and to come, so the whole world is as a point to him, in
regard of place, as before was said; it is as a small dust, and grain of dust: it is impossible that one part of
his essence can be separated from another, for he is not a body, to have one part separable from another.
The light of the sun cannot be cut into parts, it cannot be shut into any place and kept there, it is entire in
every place. Shall not God, who gives the light that power, be much more present himself? Whatsoever
hath parts is finite, but God is infinite, therefore hath no parts of his essence. Besides, if there were such a
division of his being, be would not be the most simple and uncompounded being, but would be made up
of various parts; he would not be a Spirit, for parts are evidences of composition; and it could not be said
that God is here or there, but only, a part of God here, and a part of God there. But he fills heaven and
earth; he is as much a God in the earth beneath as in heaven above (Deut. 4:39); entirely in all places, not
by scraps and fragments of his essence.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) This essential presence is not by multiplication. For that which is infinite cannot multiply itself, or
make itself more or greater than it was.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) This essential presence is not by extension or diffusion, as a piece of gold may be beaten out to
cover a large compass of ground; no, if God should create millions of worlds he would be in them all, not
by stretching out his being, but by the infiniteness of his being; not by a new growth of his being, but by
the same essence he had from eternity: upon the same reasons mentioned before, his simplicity and
indivisibility.
</p>
<p>
     (5.) But totally. There is no space, not the least, wherein God is not wholly, according to his essence,
and wherein his whole substance doth not exist; not a part of heaven can be designed wherein the Creator
is not wholly; as he is in one part of heaven, he is in every part of heaven. Some kind of resemblance we
may have from the water of the sea, which fills the great space of the world, and is diffused through all;
yet the essence of water is in every drop of water in the sea, as much as the whole; and the same quality of
water, though it comes short in quantity; and why shall we not allow God a nobler way of presence
without diffusion, as is in that? or take this resemblance; since God likens himself to light in the Scripture,
“he covereth himself with light.”652 A crystal globe hung up in the air hath light all about it, all within it,
every part is pierced by it, wherever you see the crystal you see the light; the light in one part of the
crystal cannot be distinguished from the light in the other part; and the whole essence of light is in every
part; and shall not God be as much present with his creatures, as one creature can be with another?653 God
is totally everywhere by his own simple substance.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. IV. God is present beyond the world. He is within and above all places, though places should be
infinite in number; as he was before and beyond all time, so he is above and beyond all place; being from
eternity before any real time, he must also be without as well as within any real space; if God were only
confined to the world, he would be no more infinite in his essence than the world is in quantity; as a
moment cannot be conceived from eternity, wherein God was not in being, so a space cannot be
conceived in the mind of man, wherein God is not present; he is not contained in the world nor in the
heavens (1 Kings 8:27). “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven of heavens cannot
contain thee.” Solomon wonders that God should appoint a temple to be erected to him upon the earth,
when he is not contained in the vast circuit of the heavens; his essence is not straitened in the limits of any
created work; he is not contained in the heavens, i. e. in the manner that he is there; but he is there in his
essence, and therefore cannot be contained there in his essence. If it should be meant only of his power
and providence, it would conclude also for his essence; if his power and providence were infinite, his
essence must be so too; for the infiniteness of his essence is the ground of the infiniteness of his power. It
can never enter into any thought, that a finite essence can have an infinite power, and that an infinite
power can be without an infinite essence; it cannot be meant of his providence, as if Solomon should say,
the heaven of heavens cannot contain thy providence; for naming the heaven of heavens, that which
encircles and bounds the other parts of the world, he could not suppose a providence to be exercised
where there was no object to exercise it about; as no creature is mentioned to be beyond the uttermost
heaven, which he calls here the heaven of heavens: besides, to understand it of his providence, doth not
consist with Solomon’s admiration: he wonders that God, that hath so immense an essence, should dwell
in a temple made with hands; he could not so much wonder at his providence in those things that
immediately concern his worship. Solomon plainly asserts this of God, That he was so far from being
bounded within the rich wall of the temple, which with so much cost he had framed for the glory of his
name, that the richer palace of the heaven of heavens could not contain him; it is true, it could not contain
his power and wisdom, because his wisdom could contrive other kind of worlds, and his power erect
them. But doth the meaning of that wise king reach no farther than this? Will the power and wisdom of
God reside on the earth? He was too wise to ask such a question, since every object that his eyes met with
in the world resolved him, that the wisdom and power of God dwelt upon the earth, and glittered in
everything he had created; and reason would assure him that the power that had framed this world, was
able to frame any more; but Solomon, considering the immensity of God’s essence, wonders that God
should order a house to be built for him, as if he wanted roofs and coverings, and habitation, as bodily
creatures do. Will God indeed dwell in a temple, who hath an essence so immense as not to be contained
in the heaven of heavens? It is not the heaven of heavens that can contain him, his substance. Here he
asserts the immensity of his essence, and his presence not only in the heaven, but beyond the heavens; he
that is not contained in the heavens, as a man is in a chamber, is without, and above, and beyond the
heavens; it is not said, they do not contain him, but it is impossible they should contain him; they cannot
contain him. It is impossible, then, but that he should be above them; he that is without the compass of the
world, is not bounded by the limits of the world, as his power is not limited by the things he hath made,
but can create innumerable worlds, so can his essence be in innumerable spaces; for as he hath power
enough to make more worlds, so he hath essence enough to fill them, and therefore cannot be confined to
what he hath already created; innumerable worlds cannot be a sufficient place to contain God; he can only
be a sufficient place to himself;654 He that was before the world, and place, and all things, was to himself
a world, a place, and everything:655 He is really out of the world in himself, as he was in himself before
the creation of the world: as because God was before the foundation of the world, we conclude his
eternity; so because he is without the bounds of the world, we conclude his immensity, and from thence
his omnipresence. The world cannot be said to contain him, since it was created by him; it cannot contain
him now, who was contained by nothing before the world was: as there was no place to contain him
before the world was, there can be no lace to contain him since the world was. God might create more
words, circular and round as this, and those could not be so contiguous, but some spaces would be left
between; as, take three round balls, lay them as close as you can to one another, there will be some spaces
between; none would say but God would be in these spaces, as well as in the world he had created, though
there were nothing real and positive in those spaces: why should we then exclude God from those
imag’~nary spaces without the world? God might also create many worlds, and separate them by
distances, that they might not touch one another, but be at a great distance from one another; and would
not God fill them as well as he doth this? if so, he must also fill the spaces between them; for if he were in
all those worlds, and not in the spaces between those worlds, his essence would be divided; there would
be gaps in it, his essence would be cut into parts, and the distance between every part of his essence,
would be as great as the space between each world. The essence of God may be conceived then well
enough to be in all those infinite spaces where he can erect new worlds.
</p>
<p>
     I shall give one place more to prove both these propositions, viz. that God is essentially in every part
of the world, and essentially above ours without the world (Isa. 66:1): “The heaven is my throne, and the
earth is my footstool.” He is essentially in every part of the world; he is in heaven and earth at the same
time, as a man is upon his throne and his footstool. God describes himself in a human shape,
accommodated to our capacity; as if he had his head in heaven, and his feet on earth. Doth not his essence
then, fill all intermediate spaces between heaven and earth? As when the head of a man is in the upper
part of a room, and his feet upon the floor, his body fills up the space between the head and his feet: this is
meant of the essence of God; it is a similitude drawn from kings sitting upon the throne, and not their
power and authority, but the feet of their persons are supported by the footstool; so here it is not meant
only of the perfections of God, but the essence of God. Besides, God seems to tax them with an erroneous
conceit they had, as though his essence were in the temple, and not in any part of the world; therefore God
makes an opposition between heaven and earth, and the temple: “Where is the house that you built unto
me? and where is the place of my rest?” Had he understood it only of his providence, it had not been
anything against their mistake; for they granted his providence to be not only in the temple, but in all parts
of the world. “Where is the house that you build to me;” to Me, not to my power or providence, but think
to include Me within those walls. Again, it shows God to be above the heavens, if the heavens be his
throne; he sits upon them, and is above them, as kings are above the thrones on which they sit. So it
cannot be meant of his providence, because no creature being without the sphere of the heavens, there is
nothing of the power and the providence of God visible there, for there is nothing for him to employ his
providence about; for providence supposeth a creature in actual being; it must be therefore meant of his
essence, which is above the world and in the world. And the like ptoof you may see (Job 11:7, 8), “It is as
high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know? the measure thereof is longer
than the earth, and broader than the sea.” Where he intends the unsearchableness of God’s wisdom, but
proves it by the infiniteness of his essence, (Heb.) “he is the height of the heavens,” he is the top of all the
heavens; so that, when you have begun at the lowest part, and traced him through all the creatures, you
will find his essence filling all the creatures, to be at the top of the world, and infinitely beyond it.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. V. This is the property of God, incommunicable to any creature. As no creature can be eternal
and immutable, so no creature can be immense, because it cannot be infinite; nothing can be of an infinite
nature, and therefore nothing of an immense presence but God. It cannot be communicated to the human
nature of Christ, though in union with the Divine;656 some indeed argue, that Christ in regard of his
human nature is everywhere, because he sits at the right hand of God, and the right hand of God is
everywhere. His sitting at the right hand of God signifies his exaltation, and cannot with any reason, be
extended to such a kind of arguing. “The hearts of kings are in the hand of God;” are the hearts of kings
everywhere, because God’s hand is everywhere? The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God; is the
soul, therefore, of every righteous man everywhere in the world? The right hand of God is from eternity;
is the humanity of Christ, therefore, from eternity, because it sits at the right hand of God? The right hand
of God made the world; did the humanity of Christ, therefore, make heaven and earth? the humanity of
Christ must then be confounded with his divinity; be the same with it, not united to it. All creatures are
distinct from their Creator, and cannot inherit the properties essential to his nature, as eternity, immensity,
immutability, omnipresence, omniscience; no angel, no soul, no creature can be in all paces at once;
before they can be so they must be immense, and so must cease to be creatures, and commence God; this
is impossible.
</p>
<p>
     II. Reasons to prove God’s essential presence. Reason I. Because he is infinite. As he is infinite, he is
everywhere; as he is simple, his whole essence is everywhere: for, in regard of his infiniteness, he hath no
bounds; in regard of his simplicity, he hath no parts and, therefore, those that deny God’s omnipresence,
though they pretend to own him infinite, must really conceive him finite.
</p>
<p>
     1. God is infinite in his perfections. None can set bounds to terminate the greatness and excellency of
God (Psalm 145:3): “His greatness is unsearchable,” Sept. οὐχ ἔστι πέρας, there is no end, no limitation.
What hath no end is infinite; his power is infinite (Job 5:9): “which doth great things and
unsearchable;”—no end of those things he is able to do. His wisdom infinite (Psalm 147:5); he
understands all things past, present, and to come; what is already made, what is possible to be made. His
duration infinite (Job 36:26): “The number of his years cannot be searched out” ἀπέραντος. To make a
finite thing of nothing is an argument of an infinite virtue. Infinite power can only extract something out
of the barren womb of nothing; but all things were drawn forth by the word of God, the heavens, and all
the host of them; the sun, moon, stars, the rich embellishments of the world, appeared in being “at the
breath of his mouth” (Psalm 33:6). The author, therefore, must be infinite; and since nothing is the cause
of God, or of any perfection in him,—since he derives not his being, or the least spark of his glorious
nature, from anything without him,—he cannot be limited in any part of his nature by anything without
him; and, indeed, the infiniteness of his power and his other perfections is asserted by the prophet, when
he tells us that “the nations are as a drop of a bucket, or the dust of the balance, and less than nothing and
vanity” (Isa. 40:15, 17), they are all so in regard of his power, wisdom, &amp;c. Conceive what a little thing a
grain of dust or sand is to all the dust that may be made by the rubbish of a house: what a little thing the
heap of the rubbish of a house is to the vast heap of the rubbish of a whole city, such an one as London;
how little that, also, would be to the dust of a whole empire; how inconsiderable that, also, to the dust of
one quarter of the world, Europe or Asia; how much less that, still, to the dust of the whole world! The
whole world is composed of an unconceivable number of atoms, and the sea of an unconceivablo number
of drops; now what a little grain of dust is in comparison to the dust of the whole world—a drop of water
from the sea, to all the drops remaining in the sea—that is the whole world to God. Conceive it still less, a
mere nothing, yet is it all less than this in comparison of God; there can be nothing more magnificently
expressive of the infiniteness of God to a human conception, than this expression of God himself in the
prophet. In the perfection of a creature, something still may be thought greater to be added to it; but God
containing all perfections in himself formally, if they be mere perfections, and eminently, if they be but
perfections in the creature, mixed with imperfection, nothing can be thought greater, and therefore every
one of them is infinite.
</p>
<p>
     2. If his perfections be infinite, his essence must be so. How God can have infinite perfections, and a
finite essence, is unconceivable by a human or angelical understanding; an infinite power, an infinite
wisdom, an infinite duration, must needs speak an infinite essence; since the infiniteness of his attributes
is grounded upon the infiniteness of his essence: to own infinite perfections in a finite subject is
contradictory. The manner of acting by his power, and knowing his wisdom, cannot exceed the manner of
being by his essence. His perfections flow from his essence, and the principle must be of the same rank
with what flows from it; and, if we conceive his essence to be the cause of his perfections, it is utterly
impossible that an infinite effect should arise from a finite cause: but, indeed, his perfections are his
essence; for though we conceive the essence of God as the subject, and the attributes of God as faculties
and qualities in that subject, according to our weak model, who cannot conceive of an infinite God
without some manner of likeness to ourselves—who find understanding, and will, and power in us distinct
from our substance; yet truly and really there is no distinction between his essence and attributes; one is
inseparable from the other. His power and wisdom are his essence; and therefore to maintain God infinite
in the one, and finite in the other, is to make a monstrous god, and have an unreasonable notion of the
Deity; for there would be the greatest disproportion in his nature, since there is no greater disproportion
can possibly be between one thing and another than there is between finite and infinite. God must not only
then be compounded, but have parts of the greatest distance from one another in nature; but God, being
the most simple being without the least composition, both must be equally infinite: if, then, his essence be
not infinite, his power and wisdom cannot be infinite, which is both against scripture and reason. Again,
how should his essence be finite, and his perfections be infinite, since nothing out of himself gave them
either the one or the other?657 Again, either the essenco can be infinite, or it cannot; if it cannot, there
must be some cause of that impossibility; that can be nothing without him, because nothing without him
can be as powerful as himself, much less too powerful for him; nothing within him can be an enemy to his
highest perfection; since he is necessarily what he is, he must be necessarily the most perfect being, and
therefore necessarily infinite, since to be something infinitely is a greater perfection than to be something
finitely:658 if he can be infinite he is infinite, otherwise he could be greater than he is, and so more blessed
and more perfect than he is, which is impossible: for being the most perfect Being, to whom nothing can
be added, he must needs be infinite.
</p>
<p>
     3. If, therefore, God have an infinite essence, he hath an infinite presence. An infinite essence cannot
be contained in a finite place, as those things which are finite have a bounded space wherein they are; so
that which is infinite hath an unbounded space; for, as fimteness speaks limitedness, so infiniteness speaks
unboundedness; and if we grant to God an infinite duration, there is no difficulty in acknowledging an
infinite presence: indeed, the infiniteness of God is a property belonging to him in regard of time and
place; he is bounded by no place, and limited to no time. Again, infinite essence may as well be
everywhere, as infinite power reaches everything; it may as well be present with every being, as infinite
power in its working may be present with nothing to bring it into being. Where God works by his power,
he is present in his essence; because his power and his essence cannot be separated; and therefore his
power, wisdom, goodness, cannot be anywhere where his essence is not: his essence cannot be severed
from his power, nor his power from his essence; for the power of God is nothing but God acting, and the
wisdom of God nothing but God knowing. As the power of God is always, so is his essence—as the
power of God is everywhere, so is his essence: whatsoever God is, he is alway, and everywhere. To
confine him to a place, is to measure his essence; as to confine his actions, is to limit his power; his
essence being no less infinite than his power and his wisdom, can be no more bounded than his power and
wisdom; but they are not separable from his essence, yea, they are his essence. If God did not fill the
whole world, he would be determined to some place, and excluded from others; and so his substance
would have bounds and limits, and then something might be conceived greater than God; for we may
conceive that a creature may be made by God of so vast a greatness as to fill the whole world, for the
power of God is able to make a body that should take up the whole space between heaven and earth, and
reach to every corner of it. But nothing can be conceived by any creature greater than God; he exceeds all
things, and is exceeded by none. God, therefore, cannot be included in heaven, nor included in the earth;
cannot be contained in either of them; for, if we should imagine them vaster than they are, yet still they
would be finite; and if his essence were contained in them, it could be no more infinite than the world
which contains it, as water is not of a larger compass than the vessel which contains it. If the essence of
God were limited, either in the heavens or earth, it must needs be finite, as the heaven and earth are; but
there is no proportion between finite and infinite; God, therefore, cannot be contained in them. If there
were an infinite body, that must be everywhere; certainly, then, an infinite Spirit must be everywhere;
unless we will account him finite, we can render no reason why he should not be in one creature as well as
in another. If he be in heaven, which is his creature, why can he not be in the earth, which is as well his
creature as the heavens?
</p>
<p>
     Reason II. Because of the continual operation of God in the world. This was one reason which made
the heathen believe that there was an infinite Spirit in the vast body of the world, acting in every thing,
and producing those admirable motions which we see everywhere in nature: that cause which acts in the
most perfect manner, is also in the most perfect manner present with its effects.
</p>
<p>
     God preserves all, and therefore is in all; the apostle thought it a good induction (Acts 17:27), “He is
not far from us, for in him we live.” For being as much as because, shows, that from his operation he
concluded his real presence with all: it is not, His virtue is not far from every one of us, but He, his
substance, himself; for, none that acknowledge a God will deny the absence of the virtue of God from any
part of the world. He works in everything, everything lives and works in him; therefore he is present with
all:659 or rather, if things live, they are in God, who gives them life. If things live, God is in them, and
gives them life; if things move, God is in them, and gives them motion; if things have any being, God is
in them, and gives them being; if God withdraws himself; they presently lose their being, and therefore
some have compared the creature to the impression of a seal upon the water, that cannot be preserved but
by the presence of the seal. As his presence was actual with what he created, so his presence is actual with
what he preserves, since creation and preservation do so little differ; if God creates things by his essential
presence, by the same he supports them; if his substance cannot be disjoined from his preserving power,
his power and wisdom cannot be separated from his essence; where there are the marks of the one, there is
the presence of the other; for it is by his essence that he is powerful and wise; no man can distinguish the
one from the other in a simple being; God doth not preserve and act things by a virtue diffused from him.
It may be demanded whether that virtue be distinct from God; if it be not, it is then the essence of God; if
it be distinct it is a creature, and then it may be asked, how that virtue which preserves other things, is
preserved itself; it must be ultimately resolved into the essence of God, or else there must be a running in
infinitum: or else,660 is that virtue of God a substance, or not? Is it endued with understanding, or not? If it
hath understanding, how doth it differ from God? If it wants understanding, can any imagine that the
support of the world, the guidance of all creatures, the wonders of nature, can be wrought, preserved,
managed by a virtue that hath nothing of understanding in it? If it be not a substance, it can much less be
able to produce such excellent operations as the preserving all the kinds of things in the world, and
ordering them to perform such excellent ends; this virtue is, therefore, God himself—the infinite power
and wisdom of God; and therefore, wheresoever the effects of these are seen in the world, God is
essentially present: some creatures, indeed, act at a distance by a virtue diffused. But such a manner of
acting comes from a limitedness of nature, that such a nature cannot be everywhere present and extend its
substance to all parts. To act by a virtue, speaks the subject finite, and it is a part of indigence: kings act in
their kindoms by ministers and messengers, because they cannot act otherwise; but God being infinitely
perfect, works all things in all immediately (1 Cor. 12:6). Illumination, sanctification, grace, &amp;c., are the
immediate works of God in the heart, and irnmediatc agents are present with what they do: it is an
argument of the greater perfection of a being, to know things immediately, which arc done in several
places, than to know them at the second hand by instruments; it is no less a perfection to be everywhere,
rather than to be tied to one place of action, and to act in other places lay instruments, for want of a power
to act immediately itself. God, indeed, acts by means and second causes in his providential dispensations
in the world, but this is not out of any defect of power to work all immediately himself; but he thereby
accommodates his way of acting to the nature of the creature, and the order of things which he hath settled
in the world. And when he works by means, he acts with those means, in those means, sustains their
faculties and virtues in them, concurs with them by his power; so that God’s acting by means doth rather
strengthen his essential presence than weaken it, since there is a necessary dependence of the creatures
upon the Creator in their being and acting; and what they are, they are by the power of God; what they
act, they act in the power of God, concurring with them; they have their motion in him as well as their
being; and where the power of God is, his essence is, because they are inseparable; and so this
omnipresence ariseth from the simplicit of the nature of God; the more vast anything is, the less confined.
All that will acknowledge God so great, as to be able to work all things by his will, without an essential
presence, cannot imagine him upon the same reason, so little as to be contained in, and bounded by any
place.
</p>
<p>
     Reason III. Because of his supreme perfection. No perfection is wanting to God; but an unbounded
essence is a perfection; a limited one is an imperfection. Though it be a perfection in a man to be wise, yet
it is an imperfection that his wisdom cannot rule all the things that concern him; though it be a perfection
to be present in a place where his affairs lie, yet is it an imperfection that he cannot be present everywhere
in the midst of all his concerns; if any man could be so, it would be universally owned as a prime
perfection in him above others: is that which would be a perfection in man to be denied to God?661 as that
which hath life is more perfect than that which hath not life; and that which hath sense is more perfect
than that which hath only life as the plants have; and what hath reason, is more perfect than that which
hath only life and sense, as the beasts have; so what is everywhere, is more perfect than that which is
bounded in some narrow confines: if a power of motion be more excellent than to be bed-rid, and
swiftness in a creature be a more excellent endowment than to be slow and snail-like, then to be
everywhere without motion, is inconceivably a greater excellency than to be everywhere successively by
motion. God sets forth his readiness to help his people and punish his enemies, or his omnipresence, by
swiftness, or “flying upon the wings of the wind” (Psalm 18:10): the wind is in every part of the air,
where it blows; it cannot be said that it is in this or that point of the air where you feel it, so as to exclude
it from another part of the air where you are not; it seems to possess all at once. If the Divine essence had
any bounds of place, it would be imperfect, as well as if it had bounds of time; where anything hath
limitation, it hath some defect in being; and therefore if God were confined or concluded, he would be as
good as nothing in regard of infiniteness. Whence should this restraint arise? there is no power above him
to restrain him to a certain space; if so, then he would not be God, but that power which restrained him
would be God: not from his own nature, for the being everywhere implies no contradiction to his nature;
if his own nature determined him to a certain place, then if he removed from that place, he would act
against his nature; to conceive any such thing of God is highly absurd. It cannot be thought God should
voluntarily impose any such restraint or confinement upon himself; this would be to deny himself a
perfection he might have; if God have not this perfection, it is either because it is inconsistent with his
nature; or, because he cannot have it; or, because he will not. The former cannot be; for if he hath
impressed upon air and light a resemblance of his excellency, to diffuse themselves and fill so vast a
space, is such an excellency inconsistent with the Creator more than the creature? whatsoever perfection
the creature hath, is eminently in God. “Understand, O ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
will you be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? he
that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?” (Psalm 94:8, 9.) By the same reason he that hath given
such a power to those creatures, air and light, shall not he be much more filling all spaces of the world? It
is so clear a rule, that the Psalmist fixes a folly and brutishness upon those that deny it; it is not therefore
inconsistent with his nature, it were not then a perfection but an imperfection; but whatsoever is an
excellency in creatures, cannot in a way of eminency be an imperfection in God; if it be then a perfection,
and God want it, it is because he cannot have it; where, then, is his power? How can he be then the
fountain of his own Being? If he will not, where is his love to his own nature and glory? since no creature
would deny that to itself which it can have, and is an excellency to it; God, therefore, hath not only a
power or fitness to be everywhere, but he is actually everywhere.
</p>
<p>
     Reason IV. Because of his immutability. If God did not fill all the spaces of heaven and earth, but
only possess one, yet it must be acknowledged that God hath a power to move himself to another. It were
absurd to fix God in a part of the heavens, like a star in an orb, without a power of motion to another
place. If he be therefore essentially in heaven, may he not be upon the earth if he please, and transfer his
substance from one place to another? to say he cannot, is to deny him a perfection which he hath
bestowed upon his creatures; the angels, his messengers, are sometimes in heaven, sometimes on the
earth; the eagles, meaner creatures, are sometimes in the air out of sight, sometimes upon the earth. If he
doth move, therefore, and recede from one place and settle in another, doth he not declare himself mutable
by changing places?—by being where he was not before, and in not being where he was before? He
would not fill heaven and earth at once, but successively; no man can be said to fill a room, that moves
from one part of a room to another; if therefore any in their imaginations stake God to the heavens, they
render him less than his creatures; if they allow him a power of motion from one place to another, they
conceive him changeable; and in either of them they own him no greater than a finite and limited Being;
limited to heaven, if they fix him there; limited to that space to which they imagine him to move.
</p>
<p>
     Reason V. Because of his omnipotency. The Almightiness of God is a notion settled in the minds of
all,—that God can do whatsoever he pleases, everything that is not against the purity of his nature, and
doth not imply a contradiction in itself; he can therefore create millions of worlds greater than this; and
millions of heavens greater than this heaven he hath already created; if so, he is then in inconceivable
spaces beyond this world, for his essence is not less narrower than his power; and his power is not to be
thought of a further extent than his essence; he cannot be excluded therefore from those vast spaces where
his power may fix those worlds if he please; if so, it is no wonder that he should fill this world: and there
is no reason to exclude God from the narrow space of this world, that is not contained in infinite spaces
beyond the world. God is wheresoever he hath a power to act; but he hath a power to act everywhere in
the world, everywhere out of the world; he is therefore everywhere in the world, everywhere out of the
world. Before this world was made, he had a power to make it in the space where now it stands; was he
not then unlimitedly where the world now is, before the world received a being by his powerful word?
Why should he not then be in every part of the world now? Can it be thought that God who was immense
before, should, after he had created the world, contract himself to the limits of one of his creatures, and tie
himself to a particular place of his own creation, and be less after his creation than he was before? This
might also be prosecuted by an argument from his eternity. What is eternal in duration, is immense in
essence; the same reason which renders him eternal, renders him immense; that which proves him to be
always, will prove him to be everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    III. The third thing is, Propositions for the further clearing this doctrine from any exceptions.
</p>
<p>
    1. This truth is not weakened by the expressions in Scripture, where God is said to dwell in heaven
and in the temple.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) He is indeed said to sit in heaven (Psalm 2:4), and to dwell on high (Psalm 113:5), but he is
nowhere said to dwell only in the heavens, as confined to them. It is the court of his majestical presence,
but not the prison of his essence: for when we are told that “the heaven is his throne,” we are told with the
same breath that the “earth is his footstool” (Isa. 66:1). He dwells on high, in regard of the excellency of
his nature, but he is in all places, in regard of the diffusion of his presence. The soul is essentially in all
parts of the body, but it doth not exert the same operations in all; the more noble discoveries of it are in
the head and heart. In the head where it exerciseth the chiefest senses for the enriching the understanding;
in the heart, where it vitally resides, and communicates life and motion to the rest of the body. It doth not
understand with the foot or toe, though it be in all parts of the body it informs; and so God may be said to
dwell in heaven, in regard of the more excellent and majestic representations of himself, both to the
creatures that inhabit the place, as angels and blessed spirits, and also in those marks of his greatness
which he hath planted before, those spiritual natures which have a nobler stamp of God upon them, and
those excellent bodies, as sun and stars, which, as so many topers, light us to behold his glory (Psalm
19:1), and astonish the minds of men when they gaze upon them. It is his court, where he hath the most
solemn worship from his creatures, all his courtiers attending there with a pure love and glowing zeal. He
reigns there in a special manner, without any opposition to his government; it is, therefore, called his
“holy dwelling place” (2 Chron. 3:27). The earth hath not that title, since sin cast a stain and a ruining
curse upon it. The earth is not his throne, because his government is opposed: but heaven is none of
Satan’s precinct, and the rule of God is uncontradicted by the inhabitants of it. It is from thence also he
hath given the greatest discoveries of himself; thence he sends the angels his messengers, his Son upon
Redemption, his Spirit for sanctification. From heaven his gifts drop down upon our heads, and his grace
upon our hearts (James 3:17). From thence the chiefest blessings of earth descend. The motions of the
heavens fatten the earth; and the heavenly bodies are but stewards to the earthly comforts for man by their
influence. Heaven is the richest, vastest, most steadfast, and majestic part of the visible creation. It is there
where he will at last manifest himself to his people in a full conjunction of grace and glory, and be forever
open to his people in uninterrupted expressions of goodness, and discoveries of his presence, as a reward
of their labor and service; and in these respects it may peculiarly be called his throne. And this doth no
more hinder his essential presence in all parts of the earth, than it doth his gracious presence in all the
hearts of his people. God is in heaven, in regard of the manifestation of his glory; in hell, by the
expressions of his justice; in the earth, by the discoveries of his wisdom, power, patience, and
compassion; in his people, by the monuments of his grace; and in all, in regard of his substance.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) He is said also to dwell in the ark and temple. It is called (Psalm 26:8) “the habitation of his
house, and the place where his honor dwells;” and to dwell in Jerusalem as in his holy mountain, “The
mountain of the Lord of Hosts” (Zech. 8:3), in regard of publishing his oracles, answering their prayers,
manifesting more of his goodness to the Israelites, than to any other nation in the world; erecting his true
worship among them, which was not settled in any part of the world besides: and his worship is
principally intended in that psalm. The ark is the place where his honor dwells. The worship of God is
called the glory of God; “They changed the glory of God into an image made like to corruptible man”
(Rom. 1:23), i. e., they changed the worship of God into idolatry; and to that also doth the place in
Zechariah refer. Now, because he is said to dwell in heaven, is he essentially only there? Is he not as
essentially in the temple and ark as he is in heaven, since there are as high expressions of his habitation
there as of his dwelling in heaven? If he dwell only in heaven, how came he to dwell in the temple? both
are asserted in Scripture, one as much as the other. If his dwelling in heaven did not hinder his dwelling in
the ark, it could as little hinder the presence of his essence on the earth. To dwell in heaven, and in one
part of the earth at the same time, is all one as to dwell in all parts of heaven, and all parts of earth. If he
were in heaven, and in the ark and temple, it was the same essence in both, though not the same kind of
manifestation of himself. If by his dwelling in heaven he meant his whole essence, why is it not also to be
meant by his dwelling in the ark? It was not, sure, part of his essence that was in heaven, and part of his
essence that was on earth; his essence would then be divided; and can it be imagiued that he should be in
heaven and the ark at the same time, and not in the spaces between? Could his essence be split into
fragments, and a gap made in it, that two distant spaces should be filled by him, and all between be empty
of him, so that God’s being said to dwell in heaven, and in the temple, is so far from impairing the truth of
this doctrine, that it more confirms and evidences it.
</p>
<p>
    2. Nor do the expressions of God’s coming to us, or departing from us, impair this doctrine of his
omnipresence. God is said to hide his face from his people (Psalm 10:1); to be far from the wicked; and
the Gentiles are said to be afar off, viz. from God (Prov. 15:29; Eph. 2:17), and upon the manifestation of
Christ made near. These must not be understood of any distance or nearness of his essence, for that is
equally hear to all persons and things; but of some other special way and manifestation of his presence.
Thus, God is said to be in believers by love, as they are in him (1 John 4:15); “He that abides in love,
abides in God, and God in him.” He that loves, is in the thing beloved; and when two love one another,
they are in one another. God is in a righteous man by a special grace, and far from the wicked in regard of
such special works; and God is said to be in a place by a special manifestation, as when he was in the
bush (Exod. 3), or manifesting his glory upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 24:16); “The glory of the Lord abode
about Mount Sinai.” God is said to hide his face when he withdraws his comforting presence, disturbs the
repose of our hearts, flasheth terror into our consciences, when he puts men under the smart of the cross;
as though he had ordered his mercy utterly to depart from them, or when he doth withdraw his special
assisting providence from us in our affairs; so he departed from Saul, when he withdrew his direction and
protection from him in the concerns of his government (1 Sam. 16:14); “The Spirit of the Lord departed
from Saul,” i. e. the spirit of government. God may be far from us in one respect, and near to us in
another; far from us in regard of comfort, yet near to us in regard of support, when his essential presence
continues the same: this is a necessary consequent upon the infiniteness of God, the other is an act of the
will of God; so he was said to forsake Christ, in regard of his obscuring his glory from his human nature,
and inflicting his wrath, though he was near to him in regard of his grace, and preserved him from
contracting any spot in his sufferings. We do not say the sun is departed out of the heavens when it is
bemisted; it remains in the same part of the heavens, passes on its course, though its beams do not reach
us by reason of the bar between us and it. The soul is in every part of the body, in regard of its substance,
and constantly in it, though it doth not act so sprightly and vigorously at one time as at another in one and
the same member, and discover itself so sensibly in its operations; so all the various effects of God
towards the sons of men, are but divers operations of one and the same essence. He is far from us, or near
to us, as he is a judge or a benefactor. When he comes to punish, it notes not the approach of his essence,
but the stroke of his justice; when he comes to benefit, it is not by a new access of his essence, but an
efflux of his grace: he departs from us when he leaves us to the frowns of his justice; he comes to us when
he encircles us in the arms of his mercy; but he was equally present with us in both dispensations, in
regard of his essence. And, likewise, God is said to come down (Gen. 11:5, “And the Lord came down to
see the city”), when he doth some signal and wonderful works which attract the minds of men to the
acknowledgment of a Supreme Power and Providence in the world, who judged God absent and careless
before.
</p>
<p>
     3. Nor is the essential presence of God with all creatures any disparagement to him. Since it was no
disparagement to create the heaven and the earth, it is no disparagement to him to fill them; if he were
essentially present with them when he created them, it is no dishonor to him to be essentially present with
them to support them; if it were his glory to create them by his essence, when they were nothing, can it be
his disgrace to be present by his essence, since they are something, and something good, and very good in
his eye (Gen. 1:31)? God saw every thing, and behold it was very good, or mighty good; all ordered to
declare his goodness wisdom, power, and to make him adorable to man, and therefore took complacency
in them. There is a harmony in all things, a combination in them for those glorious ends for which God
created them; and is it a disgrace for God to be present with his own harmonious composition? Is it not a
musician’s glory to touch with his fingers the treble, the least and tenderest string, as well as the strongest
and greatest bass? Hath not everything some stamp of God’s own being upon it, since he eminently
contains in himself the perfections of all his works? Whatsoever hath being, hath a footstep of God upon
it, who is all being; everything in the earth is his footstool, having a mark of his foot upon it; all declare
the being of God, because they had their being from God; and will God account it any disparagement to
him to be present with that which confirms his being, and the glorious perfections of his nature, to his
intelligent creatures? The meanest things are not without their virtues, which may boast God’s being the
Creator of them, and rank them in the midst of his works of wisdom as well as power. Doth God debase
himself to be present by his essence, with the things he hath made, more than he doth to know them by his
essence? Is not the least thing known by him? How? not by a faculty or act distinct from his essence, but
by his essence itself. How is anything disgraceful to the essential presence of God, that is not disgraceful
to his knowledge by his essence? Besides, would God make anything that should be an invincible reason
to him to part with his own infiniteness, by a contraction of his own essence into a less compass than
before? it was immense before, it had no bounds; and would God make a world that he would be ashamed
to be present with, and continue it to the diminution and lessening of himself, rather than annihilate it to
avoid the disparagement? This were to impeach the wisdom of God, and cast a blemish upon his infinite
understanding, that he knows not the consequences of his work, or is well contented to be impaired in the
immensity of his own essence by it. No man thinks it a dishonor to light, a most excellent creature, to be
present with a toad or serpent; and though there be an infinite disproportion between light, a creature, and
the Father of lights, the Creator: yet God, being a Spirit, knows how to be with bodies as if they were not
bodies;662 and being jealous of his own honor, would not, could not do any thing that might impair it.
</p>
<p>
     4. Nor will it follow, That because God is essentially everywhere, that everything is God. God is not
everywhere by any conjunction, composition or mixture with anything on earth. When light is in every
part of a crystal globe, and encircles it close on every side, do they become one? No; the crystal remains
what it is, and the light retains its own nature; God is not in us as a part of us, but as an efficient and
preserving cause; it is not by his essential presence, but his efficacious presence, that he brings any person
into a likeness to his own nature; God is so in his essence with things, as to be distinct from them, as a
cause from the effect; as a Creator different from the creature, preserving their nature, not communicating
his own; his essence touches all, is in conjunction with none; finite and infinite cannot be joined; he is not
far from us, therefore near to us; so near that we live and move in him (Acts 17:28). Nothing is God
because it moves in him, any more than a fish in the sea, is the sea, or a part of the sea, because it moves
in it. Doth a man that holds a thing in the hollow of his hand, transform it by that action, and make it like
his hand?663 The soul and body are more straitly united, than the essence of God is, by his presence, with
any creature. The soul is in the body as a form in matter, and from their union doth arise a man; yet in this
near conjunction, both body and soul remain distinct; the soul is not the body, nor the body the soul; they
both have distinct natures and essences; the body can never be changed into a soul, nor the soul into a
body; no more can God into the creature, or the creature into God. Fire is in heated iron in every part of it,
so that it seems to be nothing but fire; yet is not fire and iron the same thing. But such a kind of arguing
against God’s omnipresence, that if God were essentially present, everything would be God, would
exclude him from heaven as well as from earth. By the same reason, since they acknowledge God
essentially in heaven, the heaven where he is should be changed into the nature of God; and by arguing
against his presence in earth, upon this ground they run such an inconvenience, that they must own him to
be nowhere, and that which is nowhere is nothing. Doth the earth become God, because God is essentially
there, any more than the heavens, where God is acknowledged by all to be essentially present? Again, if
where God is essentially, that must be God; then if they place God in a point of the heavens, not only that
point must be God, but all the world; because if that point be God, because Gcd is there, then the point
touched by that point must be God, and so consequently as far as there are any points, touched by one
another. We live and move in God, so we live and move in the air; we are no more God by that, than we
are mere air because we breathe in it, and it enters into all the pores of our body; nay, where there was a
straiter union of the divine nature to the human in our Saviour, yet the nature of both was distinct, and the
humanity was not changed into the divinity, nor the divinity into the humanity.
</p>
<p>
    5. Nor doth it follow, that because God is everywhere, therefore a creature may be worshipped
without idolatry. Some of the heathens who acknowledged God’s omnipresence, abused it to the
countenancing idolatry; because God was resident in everything, they thought everything might be
worshipped; and some have used it as an argument against this doctrine; the best doctrines may by men’s
corruption be drawn out into unreasonable and pernicious conclusions. Have you not met with any, that
from the doctrine of God’s free mercy, and our Saviour’s satisfactory death, have drawn poison to feed
their lusts, and consume their souls?—a poison composed by their own corruption, and not offered by
those truths. The Apostle intimates to us, that some did, or at least were ready to be more lavish in
sinning, because God was abundant in grace;664 “Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?” when
he prevents an objection that he thought might be made by some: but as to this case, since though God be
present in everything, yet everything retains its nature distinct from the nature of God; therefore it is not
to have a worship due to the excellency of God. As long as anything remains a creature, it is only to have
the respect from us, which is due to it in the rank of creatures. When a prince is present with his guard, or
if he should go arm in arm with a peasant, is, therefore, the veneration and honor due to the prince to be
paid to the peasant, or any of his guard? Would the presence of the prince excuse it, or would it not rather
aggravate it? He acknowledged such a person equal to me, by giving him my rights, even in my sight.
Though God dwelt in the temple, would not the Israelites have been accounted guilty of idolatry had they
worshipped the images of the cherubims, or the ark, or the altar, as objects of worship, which were erected
only as means for his service? Is there not as much reason to think God was as essentially present in the
temple as in heaven, since the same expressions are used of the one and the other? The sanctuary is called
the glorious high throne (Jer. 17:13); and he is said to dwell between the cherubims (Psalm 80:1), i. e. the
two cherubims that were at the two ends of the mercy seat, appointed by God as the two sides of his
throne in the sanctuary (Exod. 25:18), where he was to dwell (ver. 8), and meet, and commune, with his
people (ver. 22). Could this excuse Manasseh’s idolatry in bringing in a carved image into the house of
God (1 Chron. 33:7)? had it been a good answer to the charge, God is present here, and therefore
everything may be worshipped as God? If he be only essentially in heaven, would it not be idolatry to
direct a worship to the heavens, or any part of it as a due object, because of the presence of God there?
Though we look up to the heavens, where we pray and worship God, yet heaven is not the object of
worship; the soul abstracts God from the creature.
</p>
<p>
    6. Nor is God defiled by being present with those creatures which seem filthy to us. Nothing is filthy
in the eye of God as his creature; he could never else have pronounced all good; whatsoever is filthy to us,
yet, as it is a creature, it owes itself to the power of God: his essence is no more defiled by being present
with it, than his power by producing it: no creature is foul in itself, though it may seem so to us. Doth not
an infant lie in a womb of filthiness and rottenness? yet is not, the power of God present with it, in
working it curiously in the lower parts of the earth? Are his eyes defiled by seeing the substance when it is
yet imperfect? or his hand defiled by writing every member in his book (Psalm 139:15, 16)? Have not the
vilest and most noisome things excellent medicinal virtues? How are they endued with them? How are
those qualities preserved in them? by anything without God, or no? Every artificer looks with pleasure
upon the work he hath wrought with art and skill. Can his essence be defiled by being present with them,
any more than it was in giving them such virtues, and preserving them in them? God measures the
heavens and the earth with his hand; is his hand defiled by the evil influences of the planets, or the
corporeal impurities of the earth? Nothing can be filthy in the eye of God but sin, since everything else
owes its being to him. What may appear deformed and unworthy to us, is not so to the Creator; he sees
beauty where we see deformity; finds goodness where we behold what is nauseous to us. All creatures
being the effects of his power, may be the objects of his presence. Can any place be more foul than hell, if
you take it either for the hell of the damned, or for the grave where there is rottenness? yet there he is
(Psalm 139:8). When Satan appeared before God, and God spake with him (Job 1:7), could God contract
any impurity by being present where that filthy spirit was, more impure than any corporeal, noisome, and
defiling thing can be? No; God is purity to himself in the midst of noisomeness; a heaven to himself in the
midst of hell. Whoever heard of a sunbeam stained by shining upon a quagmire, any more than sweetened
by breaking into a perfumed room?665 Though the light shines upon pure and impure things, yet it mixes
not itself with either of them; so though God be present with devils and wicked men, yet without any
mixture; he is present with their essence to sustain it and support it; not in their defection, wherein lies
their defilement, and which is not a physical, but a moral evil; bodily filth can never touch an incorporeal
substance. Spirits are not present with us in the same manuer that one body is present with another; bodies
can by a touch only, defile bodies. Is the glory of an angel stained by being in a coal-mine? or could the
angel that came into the lion’s den to deliver Daniel, be any more disturbed by the stench of the place,
than he could be scratched by the paws, or torn by the teeth, of the beasts (Dan. 6:22)? Their spiritual
nature secures them against any infection when they are ministering spirits to persecuted believers in their
nasty prisons (Acts 12:7). The soul is straitly united with the body, but it is not made white or black by the
whiteness or blackness of its habitation. Is it infected by the corporeal impurities of the body, while it
continually dwells in a sea of filthy pollution? If the body be cast into a common shore, is the soul filed
by it? Can a diseased body derive a contagion to the spirit that animates it? Is it not often the purer by
grace, the more the body is infected by nature? Hezekiah’s spirit was scarce ever more fervent with God,
than when the sore, which some think to be a plague sore, was upon him (Isa. 38:3). How can any
corporeal filth impair the purity of the divine essence? It may as well be said, that God is not present in
battles and fights for his people (Joshua 23:10), because he would not be disturbed by the noise of
cannons, and clashing of swords, as that he is not present in the world because of the ill scents. Let us
therefore conclude this with the expresssion of a learned man of our own:666 “To deny the omnipresence
of God, because of ill scented places, is to measure God rather by the nicety of sense, than by the sagacity
of reason.”
</p>
<p>
    IV. Use. First, of information.
</p>
<p>
    1. Christ hath a divine nature. As eternity and immutability, two incommunicable properties of the
divine nature, are ascribed to Christ, so also is this of omnipresence or immensity (John 3:13:) “No man
hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in
heaven.” Not which was, but which is. He comes from heaven by incarnation, and remains in heaven by
his divinity. He was, while he spake to Nicodemus, locally on earth, in regard of his humanity; but in
heaven according to his deity, as well as upon earth in the union of his divine and human nature. He
descended upon earth, but he left not heaven; he was in the world before he came in the flesh (John 1:10):
“He was in the world, and the world was made by him.” He was in the world, as the “light that enlightens
every man that comes into the world.” In the world as God, before he was in the world as man. He was
then in the world as man, while he discoursed with Nicodemus; yet so, that he was also in heaven as God.
No creature but is bounded in place, either circumscribed as body, or determined as spirit to be in one
space, so as not to be in another at the same time; to leave a place where they were, and possess a place
where they were not. But Christ is so on earth, that at the same time he is in heaven; he is therefore
infinite. To be in heaven and earth at the same moment of time, is a property solely belonging to the
Deity, wherein no creature can be a partner with him. He was in the word before he came to the world,
and “the world was made by him” (John 1:10). His coming was not as the coming of angels, that leave
heaven, and begin to be on earth, where they were not before; but such a presence as can be ascribed only
to God, who fills heaven and earth. Again, if all things were made by him, then he was present with all
things which were made; for where there is a presence of power, there is also a presence of essence, and
therefore he is still present; for the right and power of conservation follows the power of creation. And,
according to this divine nature, he promiseth his presence with his church (Matt. 18:20): “There am I in
the midst of them:” and (Matt. 28:20), “I am with you alway, even to the end of the world,” i. e. by his
divinity: for he had before told them (Matt. 26:11), that they were not to have him alway with them, i. e.
according to his humanity; but in his Divine nature he is present with, and walks in the midst of, the
golden candlesticks. If we understand it of a presence by his Spirit in the midst of the church, doth it
invalidate his essential presence? No; he is no less than the Spirit whom he sends; and therefore as little
confined as the Spirit is, who dwells in every believer: and this may also be inferred from John 10:30:
“My father and I are one;” not one by consent, though that be included, but one in power: for he speaks
not of their consent, but of their joint power in keeping his people. Where there is a unity of essence, there
is a unity of presence.
</p>
<p>
     2. here is a confirmation of the spiritual nature of God. If he were an infinite body, he could not fill
heaven and earth, but with the exclusion of all creatures. Two bodies cannot be in the same space; they
may be near one another, but not in any of the same points together. A body bounded he hath not, for that
would destroy his immensity; he could not then fill heaven and earth, because a body cannot be at one and
the same time in two different spaces; but God doth not fill heaven at one time, and the earth at another,
but both at the same time. Besides a limited body cannot be said to fill the whole earth, but one particular
space in the earth at a time. A body may fill the earth with its virtue, as the sun, but not with its substance.
Nothing can be everywhere with a corporeal weight and mass; but God being infinite, is not tied to any
part of the world, but penetrates all, and equally acts by his infinite power in all.
</p>
<p>
     3. Here is an argument for providence. His presence is mentioned in the text, in order to his
government of the affairs of the world. Is he everywhere, to be unconcerned with everything? Before the
world had a being, God was present with himself; since the world hath a being, he is present with his
creatures, to exercise his wisdom in the ordering, as he did his power in the production of them. As the
knowledge of God is not a bare contemplation of a thing, so his presence is not a bare inspection into a
thing. Were it an idle careless presence, it were a presence to no purpose, which cannot be imagined of
God. Infinite power. goodness, and wisdom, being everywhere present with his essence, are never without
their exercise. He never manifests any of his perfections, but the manifestation is full of some indulgence
and benefit to his creatures. It cannot be supposed God should neglect those things, wherewith he is
constantly present in a way of efficiency and operation. He is not everywhere without acting everywhere.
“Wherever his essence is, there is a power and virtue worthy of God everywhere dispensed.”667 He
governs by his presence what he made by his power; and is present as an agent with all his works. His
power and essence are together, to preserve them while he pleases, as his power and his essence were
together, to create them when he saw good to do it. Every creature hath a stamp of God, and his presence
is necessary to keep the impression standing upon the creature. As all things are his works, they are the
objects of his cares; and the wisdom he employed in framing them will not suffer him to be careless of
them. His presence with them engageth him in honor not to be a negligent Governor. His immensity fits
him for government; and where there is a fitness, there is an exercise of government, where there are
objects for the exercise of it. He is worthy to have the universal rule of the world; he can be present in all
places of his empire; there is nothing can be done by any of his subjects, but in his sight. As his eternity
renders him King alway, so his immensity renders him King everywhere. If he were only present in
heaven, it might occasion a suspicion that he minded only the things of heaven, and had no concern for
things below that vast body; but if he be present here, his presence hath a tendency to the government of
those things with which he is present. We are all in him as fish in the sea; and he bears all creatures in the
womb of his providence, and the arms of his goodness. It is most certain that his presence with his people
is far from being an idle one; for when he promises to be with them, he adds some special cordial, as, “I
will be with thee, and bless thee” (Gen. 26:3.) “I am with thee, and I will strengthen thee” (Jer. 15:20.) “I
will help thee, I will uphold thee” (Isa. 41:10, 14.) Infinite goodness will never countenance a negligent
presence.
</p>
<p>
     4. The omniscience of God is inferred from hence. If God be present everywhere, he must needs know
what is done everywhere. It is for this end he proclaims himself a God filling heaven and earth, in the text,
“Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the Lord? I have heard what the
prophets say, that prophesy lies in my name: if I fill heaven and earth, the most secret thing cannot be hid
from my sight.” An intelligent being cannot be everywhere present, and more intimate in everything, than
it can be in itself; but he must know what is done without, what is thought within. Nothing can be obscure
to Him who is in every part of the world, in every part of his creatures. Not a thought can start up but in
his sight, who is present in the souls and minds of everything. How easy is it with him, to whose essence
the world is but a point, to know and observe everything done in this world, as any of us can know what is
done in one point of place where we are present! If light were an understanding being, it would behold
and know everything done where it diffuseth itself. God is light (as light in a crystal glass all within it, all
without it), and is not ignorant of what is done within and without; no ignorance can be fastened upon him
who hath an universal presence. Hence, by the way, we may take notice of the wonderful patience of God,
who bears with so many provocations; not from a principal of ignorance, for he bears with sins that are
committed near him in his sight, sins that he sees, and cannot but see.
</p>
<p>
     5. Hence may be inferred the incomprehensibility of God. He that fills heaven and earth cannot be
contained in anything; he fills the understandings of men, the understandings of angels, but is
comprehended by neither; it is a rashness to think to find out any bounds of God; there is no measuring of
an infinite Being; if it were to be measured it were not infinite; but because it is infinite, it is not to be
measured. God sits above the cherubims (Ezek. 10:1), above the fulness, above the brightness, not only of
a human, but a created understanding. Nothing is more present than God, yet nothing more hid; he is
light, and yet obscurity;668 his perfections are visible, yet unsearchable; we know there is an infinite God,
but it surpasseth the compass of our minds; we know there is no number so great, but another may be
added to it; but no man can put it in practice, without losing himself in a maze of figures. What is the
reason we comprehend not many, nay, most things in the world? partly from the excellency of the object,
and partly from the imperfection of our understandings. How can we then comprehend God, who exceeds
all, and is exceeded by none; contains all, and is contained by none; is above our understanding, as well as
above our sense? as considered in himself infinite; as considered in comparison with our understandings,
incomprehensible; who can, with his eye, measure the breadth, length and depth of the sea, and at one
cast, view every dimension of the heavens? God is greater, and we cannot know him (Job 3:26); he fills
the understanding as he fills heaven and earth; yet is above the understanding as he is above heaven and
earth. He is known by faith, enjoyed by love, but comprehended by no mind. God is not contained in that
one syllable, God; by it we apprehend an excellent and unlimited nature; himself only understands
himself, and can unveil himself.
</p>
<p>
     6. How wonderful is God, and how nothing are creatures! “Ascribe the greatness to our God” (Deut.
33:3); he is admirable in the consideration of his power, in the extent of his understanding, and no less
wonderful in the immensity of his essence that, as Austin saith, he is in the world, yet not confined to it;
he is out of the world, yet not debarred from it; he is above the world, yet not elevated by it; he is below
the world, yet not depressed by it; he is above all, equalled by none; he is in all, not because he needs
them, but they stand in need of him; this, as well as eternity, makes a vast disproportion between God and
the creature: the creature is bounded by a little space, and no space is so great as to bound the Creator. By
this we may take a prospect of our own nothingness: as in the consideration of God’s holiness we are
minded of our own impurity; and in the thoughts of his wisdom have a view of our own folly; and in the
meditation of his power, have a sense of our weakness; so his immensity should make us, according to
our own nature, appear little in our own eyes. What little, little, little things are we to God! less than an
atom in the beams of the sun; poor drops to a God that fills heaven and earth, and yet dare we to strut
against him, and dash ourselves against a rock? If the consideration of ourselves in comparison with
others, be apt to puff us up, the consideration of ourselves in comparison with God, will be sufficient to
pull us down. If we consider him in the greatness of his essence, there is but little more proportion
between him and us, than between being and not being, than between a drop and the ocean. How should
we never think of God without a holy admiration of his greatness, and a deep sense of our own littleness!
and as the angels cover their faces before him, with what awe should creeping worms come into his sight!
and since God fills heaven and earth with his presence, we should fill heaven and earth with his glory; for
this end he created angels to praise him in heaven, and men to worship him on earth, that the places he
fills with his presence may be filled with his praise: we should be swallowed up in admiration of the
immensity of God, as men are at the first sight of the sea, when they behold a mass of waters, without
beholding the bounds and immense depth of it.
</p>
<p>
     7. How much is this attribute of God forgotten or contemned! We pretend to believe him to be present
everywhere, and yet many live as if he were present nowhere.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) It is commonly forgotten, or not believed. All the extravagances of men may be traced to the
forgetfulness of this attribute as their spring. The first speech Adam spake in paradise after his fall,
testified his unbelief of this (Gen. 3:10; “I heard thy voice in the garden, and I hid myself;” his ear
understood the voice of God, but his mind did not conclude the presence of God; he thought the trees
could shelter him from Him whose eye was present in the minutest parts of the earth; he that thought after
his sin, that he could hide himself from the presence of his justice, thought before that he could hide
himself from the presence of his knowledge; and being deceived in the one, he would try what would be
the fruit of the other. In both he forgets, if not denies, this attribute; either corrupt notions of God, or a
slight belief of what in general men assent unto, gives birth to every sin. In all transgressions there is
something of atheism; either denying the being of God, or a dash upon some perfection of God;—a not
believing his holiness to hate it, his truth that threatens, his justice to punish it, and his presence to
observe it. Though God be not afar off in his essence, he is “afar off in the apprehension of the sinner.”669
There is no wicked man, but if he be an atheist, he is a heretic; and to gratify his lust, will fancy himself to
he out of the presence of his Judge. His reason tells him, God is present with him, his lust presseth him to
embrace the season of sensual pleasure; he will forsake his reason, and prove a heretic, that he may be an
undisturbed sinner; and sins doubly, both in the error of his mind, and the vileness of his practice; he will
conceit God with those in Job, “veiled with thick clouds” (Job 22:14), and not able to pierce into the
lower world, as if his presence and cares were confined to celestial things, and the earth were too low a
sphere for his essence to reach, at least with any credit. It is forgotten by good men, when they fear too
much the designs of their enemies; “Fear not, for I am with thee” (Isa. 43:5). If the presence of God be
enough to strengthen against fear, then the prevailing of fear issues from our forgetfulness of it.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) This attribute of God’s omnipresence is for the most part contemned. When men will commit that
in the presence of God which they would be afraid or ashamed to do before the eye of man, men do not
practice that modesty before God as before men. He that would restrain his tongue out of fear of men’s
eye, will not restrain either tongue or hands out of fear of God’s. What is the language of this, but that
God is not present with us, or his presence ought to be of less regard with us, and influence upon us, than
that of a creature?670 Ask the thief why he dares to steal? will he not answer, “No eye sees him?” Ask the
adulterer why he strips himself of his chastity, and invades the rights of another? will he not answer (Job
24:15), “No eye sees me?” He disguiseth himself to be unseen by man, but slights the all-seeing eye of
God. If only a man know them, they are in terror of the shadow of death; they are planet-struck, but stand
unshaken at the presence of God (Job 24:17). Is not this to account God as limited as man—as ignorant,
as absenting, as if God were something less than those things which restrain us? ’Tis a debasing God
below a creature. If we can forbear sin from an awe of the presence of man, to whom we are equal in
regard of nature, or from the presence of a very mean man, to whom we are superior in regard of
condition, and not forbear it because we are within the ken of God, we respect him not only as our
inferior, but inferior to the meanest man or child of his creation, in whose sight we would not commit the
like action: it is to represent him as a sleepy, negligent, or careless God; as though anything might be
concealed from him, before whom the least fibres of the heart are anatomised and open, who sees as
plainly midnight as noon-day sins (Heb. 4:13). Now this is a high aggravation of sin to break a king’s
laws, in his sight, is more bold than to violate them behind his back; as it was Haman’s offence when he
lay upon Esther’s bed, to force the queen before the king’s face. The least iniquity receives a high tincture
from this; and no sin can be little that is an affront in the face of God, and casing the filth of the creature
before the eyes of his holiness: as if a wife should commit adultery before her husband’s face, or a slave
dishonor his master, and disobey his commands in his presence. And hath it not often been thus with us?
have we not been disloyal to God in his sight, before his eyes, those pure eyes that cannot behold iniquity
without anger and grief? (Isa. 65:12), “Ye did evil before my eyes.” Nathan chargeth this home upon
David (2 Sam. 12:9), “Thou hast despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight;” and
David, in his repentance, reflects upon himself for it (Psalm 51:4); “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
and done this evil in thy sight.” I observed not thy presence, I neglected thee while thy eye was upon me.
And this consideration should sting our hearts in all our confessions of our crimes. Men will be afraid of
the presence of others, whatsoever they think in their heart. How unworthily do we deal with God, in not
giving him so much as an eye-service, which we do man!
</p>
<p>
     8. How terrible should the thoughts of this attribute be to sinners! How foolish is it, to imagine any
hiding-place from the incomprehensible God, who fills and contains all things, and is present in every
point of the world!671 When men have shut the door, and made all darkness within, to meditate or commit
a crime, they cannot in the most intricate recesses be sheltered from the presence of God. If they could
separate themselves from their own shadows, they could not avoid his company, or be obscured from his
sight.672 Hypocrites cannot disguise their sentiments from him; he is in the most secret nook of their
hearts. No thought is hid, no lust is secret, but the eye of God beholds this, and that, and the other. He is
present with our heart when we imagine, with our hands when we act. We may exclude the sun from
peeping into our solitudes, but not the eyes of God from beholding our actions. “The eyes of the Lord are
in every place, beholding the evil and good” (Prov. 15:3). He lies in the depths of our souls, and sees afar
off our designs before we have conceived them. He is in the greatest darkness, as well as the clearest
light; in the closest thought of the mind, as well as the openest expressions. Nothing can be hid from him,
no, not in the darkest cells or thickest walls. “He compasseth our path wherever we are” (Psalm 139:3),
and “is acquainted with all our ways.” He is as much present with wicked men to observe their sins, as he
is to detest them. Where he is present in his essence, he is present in his attributes: his holiness to hate,
and his justice to punish, if he please to speak the word. It is strange men should not be mindful of this,
when their very sins themselves might put them in mind of his presence. Whence hast thou the power to
act? who preserves thy being, whereby thou art capable of committing that evil? Is it not his essential
presence that sustains us, and his arm that supports us? and where can any man fly from his presence? Not
the vast regions of heaven could shelter a sinning angel from his eye: how was Adam ferreted out of his
hiding-places in paradise? Nor can we find the depths of the sea a sufficient covering to us. If we were
with Jonah, closeted up in the belly of a whale; if we had the “wings of the morning,” as quick a motion
as the light at the dawning of the day, that doth in an instant surprise and overpower the regions of
darkness, and could pass to the utmost parts of the earth or hell, there we should find him, there his eye
would be upon us, there would his hand lay hold of us, and lead us as a conqueror triumphing over a
captive (Psalm 139:8–10). Nay, if we could leap out of the compass of heaven and earth, we should find
as little reserves from him: he is without the world in those infinite spaces which the mind of man can
imagine. In regard of his immensity, nothing in being can be distant from him, wheresoever it is.
</p>
<p>
     Second, Use is for comfort. That God is present everywhere, is as much a comfort to a good man, as it
is a terror to a wicked one, He is everywhere for his people, not only by a necessary perfection of his
nature, but an immense diffusion of his goodness. He is in all creatures as their preserver: in the damned,
as their terror; in his people, as their protector. He fills hell with his severity, heaven with his glory, his
people with his grace. He is with his people as light in darkness, a fountain in a garden, as manna in the
ark. God is in the world as a spring of preservation; in the church as his cabinet, his spring of grace and
consolation. A man is present sometimes in his field, but more delightfully in his garden. A vine yard, as
it hath more of cost, so more of care, and a watchful presence of the owner (Isa. 27:3); “I, the Lord, do
keep it,” viz. his vineyard; “I will water it every moment, lest any hurt it; I will keep it night and day.” As
there is a presence of essence, which is natural, so there is a presence of grace, which is federal: a
presence by covenant; “I will not leave thee, I will be with thee.” This latter depends upon the former; for,
take away the immensity of God, and you leave no foundation for his universal gracious presence with his
people in all their emergencies, in all their hearts. And, therefore, where he is present in his essence, he
cannot be absent in his grace, from them that fear him. It is from his filling heaven and earth he proves his
knowledge of the designs of the false prophets; and from the same topic may as well be inferred the
employment of his power and grace for his people.
</p>
<p>
     1. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all violent temptations. No fiery dart can be so present
with us, as God is present both with that and the marksman. The most raging devils cannot be so near us,
as God is to us and them. He is present with his people to relieve them, and present with the devil to
manage him to his own holy purposes: so he was with Job, defeating his enemies, and bringing him
triumphantly out of those pressing trials. This presence is such a terror, that whatsoever the devil can
despoil us of, he must leave this untouched. He might scratch the apostle with a thorn (2 Cor. 12:7, 9), but
he could not rifle him of the presence of divine grace, which God promised him. He must prevail so far as
to make God cease to be God, before he can make him to be distant from us; and while this cannot be, the
devils and men can no more hinder the emanations of God to the soul, than a child can cut off the rays of
the sun from embellishing the earth. It is no mean support for a good man, at any time, buffeted by a
messenger of Satan, to think God stands near him, and behold how ill he is used. It would be a satisfaction
to a king’s favorite, in the midst of the violence some enemies might use to him apon a surprise, to
understand that the king who loves him stands behind a curtain, and through a hole sees the injuries he
suffers: and were the devil as considering as he is malicious, he could not but be in great fear at God’s
being in the generation of the righteous, as his serpentine seed is (Prov. 3:6): “They were in great fear, for
God is in the generation of the righteous.”
</p>
<p>
     2. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in sharp afflictions. Good men have a comfort in this
presence in their nasty prisons, oppressing tribunals; in the overflowing waters or scorching flames he is
still with them (Isa. 43:2); and many times by his presence keeps the bush from consuming, when it seems
to be all in a flame. In afflictions God shows himself most present, when friends are most absent: “When
my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord shall take me up” (Psalm 27:10), then God will stoop and
gather me into his protection; or, (Heb.) “shall gather me,” alluding to those tribes that were to bring up
the rear in the Israelites’ march, to take care that none were left behind, and exposed to famine or wild
beasts, by reason of some disease that disenabled them to keep pace with their brethren. He that is the
sanctuary of his people in all calamities, is more present with them to support them, than their adversaries
can be present with them to afflict them (Psalm 4:2), a present help in the time of trouble; He is present
with all things for this end; though his presence be a necessary presence in regard of the immensity of his
nature, yet the end of this presence in regard that it is for the good of his people, is a voluntary presence. It
is for the good of man he is present in the lower world, and principally for the good of his people, for
whose sake he keeps up the world (2 Chron. 16:9). “His eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to
show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him.” If he doth not deliver good
men from afflictions, he will be so present as to manage them in them, as that his glory shall issue from
them, and their grace be brightened by them.673 What a man was Paul when he was lodged in a prison, or
dragged to the courts of judicature, when he was torn with rods, or laden with chains! then did he show
the greatest miracles, made the judge tremble upon the bench, and brake the heart, though not the prison,
of the jailor; so powerful is the presence of God in the pressures of his people. This presence outweighs
all other comforts, and is more valuable to a Christian than barns of corn, or cellars of wine can be to a
covetous man (Psalm 4:7): it was this presence was David’s cordial in the mutinying of his soldiers (1
Sam. 30:6). What a comfort is this in exile, or a forced desertion of our habitations! Good men may be
banished from their country, but never from the presence of their Protector; ye cannot say of any corner of
the earth, or of any dungeon in a prison, God is not here; if you were cast out of your country a thousand
miles off, you are not out of God’s precinct; his arm is there to cherish the good, as well as to drag out the
wicked; it is the same God, the same presence in every country, as well as the same sun, moon, and stars;
and were not God everywhere, yet he could not be meaner than his creature the sun in the firmament,
which visits every part of the habitable world in twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p>
     3. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all duties of worship. He is present to observe, and
present to accept our petitions, and answer our suits. Good men have not only the essential presence,
which is common to all, but his gracious presence; not only the presence that flows from his nature, but
that which flows from his promise; his essential presence makes no difference between this and that man
in regard of spirituals, without this in conjunction with it; his nature is the cause of the presence of his
essence; his will engaged by his truth is the cause of the presence of his grace. He promised to meet the
Israelites in the place where he should set his name, and in all places where he doth record it (Exod. 20:4).
“In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee;” in every place where
I shall manifest the special presence of my divinity. In all places, hands may be lifted up, without
doubting of his ability to hear; he dwells in the contrite hearts, wherever it is most in the exercise of
contrition; which is usually in times of special worship (Isa. 7:15), and that to revive and refresh them.
Habitation notes a special presence, though he dwell in the highest heavens in the sparklings of his glory,
he dwells also in the lowest hearts in the beams of his grace; as none can expel him from his dwelling in
heaven, so none can reject him from his residence in the heart. The tabernacle had his peculiar presence
fixed to it (Lev. 26:11); his soul should not abhor them, as they are washed by Christ, though they are
loathsome by sin: in a greater dispensation there cannot be a less presence, since the church under the
New Testament is called the temple of the Lord, wherein he will both dwell and walk (2 Cor. 6:6); or, I
will indwell in them; as if he should say, I will dwell in and in them; I will, dwell in them by grace, and
walk in them by exciting their graces; he will be more intimate with them than their own souls, and
converse with them as the living God, i. e. as a God that hath life in himself, and life to convey to them in
their converse with him; and show his spiritual glory among them in a greater measure than in the temple,
since that was but a heap of stones, and the figure of the Christian church the mystical body of his Son.
His presence is not less in the substance than it was in the shadow; this presence of God in his ordinances,
is the glory of a church, as the presence of a king is the glory of a court, the defence of it, too, as a wall of
fire (Zech. 2:5); alluding to the fire travellers in a wilderness made to fright away wild beasts. It is not the
meanness of the place of worship can exclude him; the second temple was not so magnificent as the first
of Solomon’s erecting, and the Jews seemed to despond of so glorious a presence of God in the second, as
they had in the first, because they thought it not so good for the entertainment of Him that inhabits
eternity; but God comforts them against this conceit again and again (Hag. 2:3, 4): “be strong, be strong,
be strong, I am with you;” the meanness of the place shall not hinder the grandeur of my presence, no
matter what the room is, so it be the presence-chamber of the king, wherein he will favor our suits; he can
everywhere slide into our souls with a perpetual sweetness, since he is everywhere, and so, intimate with
every one that fears him. If we should see God on earth in his amiableness, as Moses did, should we not
be encouraged by his presence, to present our requests to him, to echo out our praises of him? and have
we not as great a ground now to do it, since he is as really present with us, as if he were visible to us? he
is in the same room with us, as near to us as our souls to our bodies, not a word but he hears, not a motion
but he sees, not a breath but he perceives; he is through all, he is in all.
</p>
<p>
     4. The omnipresence of God is a comfort in all special services. God never puts any upon a hard task,
but he makes promises to encourage them and assist them, and the matter of the promise is that of his
presence; so he did assure the prophets of old when he set them difficult tasks, and strengthened Moses
against the face of Pharaoh, by assuring him “he would be with his mouth” (Exod. 4:12); and when Christ
put his apostles upon a contest with the whole world, to preach a gospel that would be foolishness to the
Greeks, and a stumbling block to the Jews, he gives them a cordial only composed of his presence (Matt.
28:20), I will be with you; it is this presence scatters by its light the darkness of our spirits; it is this that is
the cause of what is done for his glory in the world; it is this that mingles itself with all that is done for his
honor; it is this from whence springs all the assistance of his creatures, marked out for special purposes.
</p>
<p>
     5. This presence is not without the special presence of all his attributes. Where his essence is, his
perfections are, because they are one with his essence; yea, they are his essence, though they have their
several degrees of manifestation. As in the covenant, he makes over himself, not a part of himself, but his
whole deity; so in promising of his presence, he means not a part of it, but the whole, the presence of all
the excellencies of his nature to be manifested for our good. It is not a piece of God is here and another
parcel there, but God in his whole essence and perfections; in his wisdom to guide us, his power to protect
and support us, his mercy to pity us, his fulness to refresh us, and his goodness to relieve us: he is ready to
sparkle out in this or that perfection, as the necessities of his people require, and his own wisdom directs
for his own honor; so that being not far from us in an excellency of his nature, we can quickly have
recourse to him upon any emergency; so that if we are miserable, we have the presence of his goodness; if
we want direction, we have the presence of his wisdom; if we are weak, we have the presence of his
power; and should we not rejoice in it, as a man doth in the presence of a powerful, wealthy, and
compassionate friend?
</p>
<p>
     Third, Use. Of Exhortation.
</p>
<p>
     1. Let us be much in the actual thoughts of this truth. How should we enrich our understandings with
the knowledge of the excellency of God, whereof this is none of the least; nor hath less of honey in its
bowels, though it be more terrible to the wicked than the presence of a lion; it is this that makes all other
excellencies of the divine nature sweet. What would grace, wisdom, power, signify at a distance from us?
Let us frame in our minds a strong idea of it; it is this makes so great a difference between the actions of
one man and another; one maintains actual thoughts of it, another doth not: though all believe it as a
perfection pertaining to the infiniteness of his essence. David, or rather a greater than David, had God
always before him; there was no time, no occasion, wherein he did not stir up some lively thoughts of him
(Psalm 16:8). Let us have right notions of it; imagine not God as a great King, sitting only in his majesty
in heaven; acting all by his servants and ministers. This, saith one,674 is a childish and unworthy conceit of
God, and may in time bring such a conceiver by degrees to deny his providence; the denial of this
perfection is an axe at the root of religion; if it be not deeply imprinted in the mind, personal religion
grows faint and feeble. Who would fear that God that is not imagined to be a witness of his actions? Who
would worship a God at a distance both from the worship and the worshipper?675 Let us believe this truth,
but not with an idle faith, as if we did not believe it. Let us know, that as wheresoever the fish moves, it is
in the water; wheresoever the bird moves, it is in the air; so wheresoever we move, we are in God. As
there is not a moment but we are under his mercy, so there is not a moment that we are out of his
presence. Let us therefore look upon nothing, without thinking who stands by, without reflecting upon
him in whom it lives, moves and hath its being. When you view a man, you fix your eyes upon his body,
but your mind upon that invisible part that acts every member by life and motion, and makes them fit for
your converse. Let us not bound our thoughts to the creatures we see, but pierce through the creature to
that boundless God we do not see: we have continual remembrances of his presence; the light, whereby
we see, and the air, whereby we live, give us perpetual notices of it, and some weak resemblance; why
should we forget it? yea, what a shame is our unmindfulness of it, when every cast of our eye, every
motion of our lungs, jogs us to remember it? Light is in every part of the air, in every part of the world,
yet not mixed with any, both remain entire in their own substance. Let us not be worse than some of the
heathens, who pressed this notion u on themselves for the spiriting their actions with virtue, that all paces
were full of God. This was the means Basil used to prescribe, upon a question asked him, How shall we
do to be serious? mind God’s presence. How shall we avoid distractions in service? think of God’s
presence. How shall we resist temptation? oppose to them the presence of God.676
</p>
<p>
    (1.) This will be a shield against all temptations. God is present, is enough to blunt the weapons of
hell; this will secure us from a ready compliance with any base and vile attractives, and curb that
headstrong principle in our nature, that would join hands with them; the thoughts of this would, like the
powerful presence of God with the Israelites, take off the wheels from the chariots of our sensitive
appetites, and make them perhaps move slower, at least, towards a temptation. How did Peter fling off’
the temptation which had worsted him, upon a look from Christ! The actuated faith of this would stifle the
darts of Satan, and fire us with an anger against his solicitations, as strong as the fire that inflames the
darts. Moses’ sight of Him that was invisible, strengthened him against the costly pleasures and luxuries
of a prince’s court (Heb. 11:27). We are utterly senseless of a Deity, if we are not moved with this item
from our consciences, God is present. Had our first parents actually considered the nearness of God to
them, when they were tempted to eat of the forbidden fruit, they had not probably been so easily
overcome by the temptation. What soldier would be so base as to revolt under the eye of a tender and
obliging general? or what man so negligent of himself, as to rob a house in the sight of a judge? Let us
consider that God is as near to observe us, as the devil to solicit us, yea, nearer; the devil stands by us, but
God is in us; we may have a thought the devil knows not, but not a thought but God is actually present
with, as our souls are with the thoughts they think; nor can any creature attract our heart, if our minds
were fixed on that invisible presence that contributes to that excellency, and sustains it, and considered
that no creature could be so present with us as the Creator is.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) It will be a spur to holy actions. What man would do an unworthy action, or speak an unhandsome
word, in the presence of his prince? The eye of the general inflames the spirit of a soldier. Why did David
keep God’s testimonies (Psalm 119:168)? because he considered that all his ways were before him;
because he was persuaded his ways were present with God; God’s precepts should be present with him.
The same was the cause of Job’s integrity (Job 31:4): “Doth he not see my ways?” To have God in our
eye is the way to be sincere (Gen. 17:1); “walk before me” as in my sight, “and be thou perfect.”
Communion with God consists chiefly in an ordering our ways as in the presence of him that is invisible.
This would make us spiritual, raise and watchful in all our passions, if we considered that God is present
with us in our shops, in our chambers, in our walks, and in our meetings, as present with us as with the
angels in heaven; who, though they have a presence of glory above us, yet have not a greater measure of
his essential presence than we have. What an awe had Jacob upon him when he considered God was
present in Bethel (Gen. 28:16, 17)! If God should appear visibly to us when we were alone, should we not
be reverend and serious before him? God is everywhere about us, he doth encompass us with his
presence. Should not God’s seeing us have the same influence upon us as our seeing God? He is not more
essentially present if he should so manifest himself to us, than when he doth not. Who would appear
besmeared in the presence of a great person? or not be ashamed to be found in his chamber in a nasty
posture by some visitant? Would not a man blush to be catched about some mean action, though it were
not an immoral crime? If this truth were impressed upon our spirits, we should more blush to have our
souls daubed with some loathsome lust; swarms of sin, like Egyptian lice and frogs, creeping about our,
heart in his sight. If the most sensual man be ashamed to do a dishonest action in the sight of a grave and
holy man, one of great reputation for wisdom and integrity, how much more should we lift up ourselves in
the ways of God, who is infinite and immense, is everywhere, and inflntely superior to man, and more to
be regarded! We could not seriously think of his presence but there would pass some intercourse between
us; we should be putting up some petition upon the sense of our indigence, or sending up our praises to
him upon the sense of his bounty. The actual thoughts of the presence of God is the life and spirit of all
religion; we could not have sluggish spirits and a careless watch if we considered that his eye is upon us
all the day.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) It will quell distractions in worship. The actual thoughts of this would establish our thoughts, and
pull them back when they begin to rove: the mind could not boldly give God the slip if it had lively
thoughts of it; the consideration of this would blow off all the froth that lies on the top of our spirits. An
eye, taken up with the presence of one object, is not at leisure to be filled with another: he that looks
intently upon the sun, shall have nothing for a while but the sun in his eye. Oppose to every intruding
thought the idea of the Divine omnipresence, and put it to silence by the awe of his Majesty. When the
master is present, scholars mind their books, keep their places, and run not over the forms to play with
one another; the master’s eye keeps an idle servant to his work, that otherwise would be gazing at every
straw, and prating to every passenger. How soon would the remembrance of this dash all extravagant
fancies out of countenance, just as the news of the approach of a prince would make the courtiers bustle
up themselves, huddle up their vain sports, and prepare themselves for a reverent behavior in his sight!
We should not dare to give God a piece of our heart when we apprehended him present with the whole:
we should not dare to mock one that we knew were more inwards with us than we are with ourselves, and
that beheld every motion of our mind, as well as action of our body.
</p>
<p>
     2. Let us endeavor for the more special and influential presence of God. Let the essential presence of
God be the ground of our awe, and his gracious influential presence the object of our desire. The heathen
thought themselves secure if they had their little petty household gods with them in their journeys: such
seem to be the images Rachel stole from her father (Gen. 31:19) to company her travel with their
blessings: she might not at that time have cast off all respect to those idols, in the acknowledgment of
which she had been educated from her infancy; and they seem to be kept by her till God called Jacob to
Bethel, after the rape of Dinah (Gen. 35:4), when Jacob called for the strange gods, and hid them under
the oak. The gracious presence of God we should look after, in our actions, as travellers, that have a
charge of money or jewels, desire to keep themselves in company that may protect them from
highwaymen that would rifle them. Since we have the concerns of the eternal happiness of our souls upon
our hands, we should endeavor to have God’s merciful and powerful presence with us in all our ways
(Psalm 14:5); “In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths:” acknowledge him before
any action, by imploring; acknowledge him after, by rendering him the glory; acknowledge his presence
before worship, in worship, after worship: it is this presence makes a kind of heaven upon earth; causeth
affliction to put off the nature of misery. How much will the presence of the sun outshine the stars of
lesser comforts, and fully answer the want of them! The ark of God going before us, can only make all
things successful. It was this led the Israelites over Jordan, and settled them in Canaan. Without this we
signify nothing: though we live without this, we cannot be distinguished forever from evils; his essential
presence they have; and if we have no more, we shall be no better. It is the enlivening fructifying presence
of the sun that revives the languishing earth; and this only can repair our ruined soul. Let it be, therefore,
our desire, that as he fills heaven and earth by his essence, he may fill our understandings and wills by his
grace, that we may have another kind of presence with us than animals have in their brutish state, or
devils m their chains: his essential presence maintains our beings, but his gracious presence confers and
continues a happiness.

<h1 class="caption">DISCOURSE VIII ON GOD’S KNOWLEDGE</h1>
<blockquote>
Great is our Lord, and of great power; his understanding is infinite.
<div class="sig"> PSALM 147:5</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
     IT is uncertain who was the author of this psalm, and when it was penned; some think after the return
from the Babylonish captivity. It is a psalm of praise, and is made up of matter of praise from the
beginning to the end: God’s benefits to the church, his providence over his creatures, and the essential
excellency of his nature.
</p>
<p>
     The psalmist doubles his exhortation to praise God (ver. 1), “Praise ye the Lord, sing praise to our
God;” to praise him from his dominion as “Lord,” from his grace and mere as “our God;” from the
excellency of the duty itself, “it is good, it is comely:” some read it comely, some lovely, or desirable,
from the various derivations of the word. Nothing doth so much delight a gracious soul, as an opportunity
of celebrating the perfections and goodness of the Creator. The highest duties a creature can render to the
Creator are pleasant and delightful in themselves; “it is comely.” Praise is a duty that affects the whole
soul. The praise of God is a decent thing; the excellency of God’s nature deserves it, and the benefits of
God’s grace requires it. It is comely when done as it ought to be, with the heart as well as with the voice;
a sinner sings ill, though his voice be good; the soul in it is to be elevated above earthly things. The first
matter of praise is God’s erecting and preserving his church (ver. 2): “The Lord doth build up Jerusalem,
he gathers together the outcasts of Israel.” The walls of demolished Jerusalem are now re-edified; God
hath brought back the captivity of Jacob, and reduced his people from their Babylonish exile, and those
that were dispersed into strange regions, he hath restored to their habitations. Or, it may be prophetic of
the calling of the Gentiles, and the gathering the outcasts of the spiritual Israel, that were before as
without God in the world, and strangers to the covenant of promise. Let God be praised, but especially for
building up his church, and gathering the Gentiles, before counted as outcasts (Isa. 11:12); he gathers
them in this world to the faith, and hereafter to glory.
</p>
<p>
     Obs. 1. From the two first verses, observe: 1. All people are under God’s care; but he has a particular
regard to his church. This is the signet on his hand, as a bracelet upon his arm; this is his garden which he
delights to dress; if he prunes it, it is to purge it; if he digs about his vine, and wounds the branches, it is to
make it beautiful with new clusters, and restore it to a fruitful vigor. 2. All great deliverances are to be
ascribed to God, as the principal Author, whosoever are the instruments. The Lord doth build up
Jerusalem, he gathers together the outcasts of Israel. This great deliverance from Babylon is not to be
ascribed to Cyrus or Darius, or the rest of our favorers; it is the Lord that doth it; we had his promise for
it, we have now his performance. Let us not ascribe that which is the effect of his truth, only to the good
will of men; it is God’s act, not by might, nor by power, nor by weapons of war, or strength of horses, but
by the Spirit of the Lord. He sent prophets to comfort us while we were exiles; and now he hath stretched
out his own arm to work our deliverance according to his word; blind man looks so much upon
instruments, that he hardly takes notice of God, either in afflictions or mercies, and this is the cause that
robs God of so much prayer and praise in the world. (ver. 3.) “He heals the broken in heart, and binds up
their wounds.” He hath now restored those who had no hope but in his word; he hath dealt with them as a
tender and skilful chirurgeon; he hath applied his curing plasters, and dropped in his sovereign balsams;
he hath now furnished our fainting hearts with refreshing cordials, and comforted our wounds with
strengthening ligatures. How gracious is God, that restores liberty to the captives, and righteousness to the
penitent! Man’s misery is the fittest opportunity for God to make his in mercy illustrious in itself, and
most welcome to the patient. He proceeds (ver. 4), wonder not that God calls together the outcasts, and
singles them out from every corner for a return; why can he not do this, as well as tell the number of the
stars, and call them all by their names? There are none of his people so despicable in the eye of man, but
they are known and regarded by God; though they are clouded in the world, yet they are the stars of the
world; and shall God number the inanimate stars in the heavens, and make no account of his living stars
on the earth? No, wherever they are disperred, he will not forget them; however they are afflicted, he will
not despise them; the stars are so numerous, that they are innumerable by man; some are visible and
known by men; others lie more hid and undiscovered in a confused light, as those in the milky way; man
cannot see one of them distinctly. God knows all his people. As he can do what is above the power of man
to perform, so he understands what is above the skill of man to discover; shall man measure God by his
scantiness? Proud man must not equal himself to God, nor cut God as short as his own line. He tells the
number of the stars, and calls them all by their names. He hath them all in his list, as generals the names
of their soldiers in their muster-roll, for they are his host, which he marshals in the heavens, as in Isaiah
40:26, where you have the like expression; he knows them more distinctly than man can know anything,
and so distinctly, as to call “them all by their names.” He knows their names, that is, their natural offices,
influences the different degrees of heat and light, their order and motion; and all of them, the least
glimmering star, as well as the most glaring planet: this, man cannot do; “Tell the stars if thou be able to
number them” (Gen. 15:5), saith God to Abraham, whom Josephus represents as a great astronomer:
“Yea, they cannot be numbered” (Jer. 33:22); and the uncertainty of the opinions of men, evidenceth their
ignorance of their number; some reckoning 1022; others 1025; others 1098; others 7000, beside those that
by reason of their mixture of light with one another, cannot be distinctly discerned, and others perhaps so
high, as not to be reached by the eye of man. To impose names on things, and names according to their
natures, is both an argument of power and dominion, and of wisdom and understanding: from the
imposition of names upon the creatures by Adam, the knowledge of Adam is generally concluded; and it
was also a fruit of that dominion God allowed him over the creatures. Now he that numbers and names the
stars that seem to lie confused among one another, as well as those that appear to us in an unclouded
night, may well be supposed accurately to know his people, though lurking in secret caverns, and know
those that are fit to be instruments of their deliverance; the one is as easy to him as the other; and the
number of the one as distinctly known by him as the multitude of the other. “For great is our Lord, and of
great power; his understanding is infinite” (ver. 5). He wants not knowledge to know the objects, nor
power to affect his will concerning them. Of great power, ‫יבכוח‬. Much power, plenteous in power; so the
word ‫רב‬, is rendered (ver. 5), ‫יבחרד‬, a multitude of power, as well as a multitude of mercy; a power that
exceeds all created power and understanding. His understanding is infinite. You may not imagine, how he
can call all the stars by name, the multitude of the visible being so great, and the multitude of the invisible
being greater; but you must know, that as God is Almighty, so he is omniscient; and as there is no end of
his power, so no account can exactly be given of his understanding; his understanding is infinite, ‫איוממפד‬.
No number or account of it; and so the same words are rendered, “a nation strong, and without number”
(Joel 1:6): no end of his understanding: (Syriac) no measure, no bounds. His essence is infinite, and so is
his power and understanding; and so vast is his knowledge, that we can no more comprehend it, than we
can measure spaces that are without limits, or tell the minutes or hours of eternity. Who, then, can fathom
that whereof there is no number, but which exceeds all, so that there is no searching of it out? He knows
universals, he knows particulars: we must not take understanding here, as noting a faculty, but the use of
the understanding in the knowledge of things, and the judgment, ‫תגינח‬, in the consideration of them, and
so it is often used. In the verse there is a description of God. 1. In his essence, “great is our Lord.” 2. In
his power of “great power.” 3. In his knowledge, “his understanding is infinite:” his understanding is his
eye, and his power is his arm. Of his infinite understanding I am to discourse.
</p>
<p>
    Doctrine. God hath an infinite knowledge and understanding. All knowledge. Omnipresence, which
before we spake of, respects his essence; omniscience respects his understanding, according to our
manner of conception. This is clear in Scripture; hence God is called a God of knowledge (1 Sam. 2:3),
“the Lord is a God of knowledge,” (Heb.) knowledges, in the plural number, of all kind of knowledge; it
is spoken there to quell man’s pride in his own reason and parts; what is the knowledge of man but a
spark to the whole element of fire, a grain of dust, and worse than nothing, in comparison of the
knowledge of God, as his essence is in comparison of the essence of God? All kind of knowledge. He
knows what angels know, what man knows, and infinitely more; he knows himself, his own operations,
all his creatures, the notions and thoughts of them; he is understanding above understanding, mind above
mind, the mind of minds, the light of lights; this the Greek word, Θὲος, signifies in the etymology of it, of
Θεῖσθαι, to see, to contemplate; and δαίμων of δαίω, scio. The names of God signify a nature, viewing and
piercing all things; and the attribution of our senses to God in Scripture, as hearing and seeing, which are
the senses whereby knowledge enters into us, signifies God’s knowledge.
</p>
<p>
     1. The notion of God’s knowledge of all things lies above the ruins of nature; it was not obliterated by
the fall of man. It was necessary offending man was to know that he had a Creator whom he had injured,
that he had a Judge to try and punish him; since God thought fit to keep up the world, it had been kept up
to no purpose, had not this notion been continued alive in the minds of men; there would not have been
any practice of his laws, no bar to the worst of crimes. If men had thought they had to deal with an
ignorant Deity, there could be no practice of religion. Who would lift lap his eyes, or spread his hands
towards heaven, if he imagined his devotion were directed to a God as blind as the heathens imagined
fortune? To what boot would it be for them to make heaven and earth resound with their cries, if they had
not thought God bad an eye to see them, and an ear to hear them? And indeed the very notion of a God at
the first blush, speaks him a Being endued with understanding; no man can imagine a Creator void of one
of the noblest perfections belonging to those creatures, that are the flower and cream of his works.
</p>
<p>
     2. Therefore all nations acknowledge this, as well as the existence and being of God. No nation but
had their temples, particular ceremonies of worship, and presented their sacrifices, which they could not
have been so vain as to do, without an acknowledgment of this attribute. This notion of God’s knowledge
owed not its rise to tradition, but to natural implantation; it was born and grew up with every rational
creature. Though the several nations and men of the world agreed not in one kind of deity, or in their
sentiments of his nature or other perfections, some judging him clothed with a fine and pure body, others
judging him an uncompounded spirit, some fixing him to a seat in the heavens, others owning his
universal presence in all parts of the world; yet they all agreed in the universality of his knowledge, and
their own consciences reflecting their crimes, unknown to any but themselves, would keep this notion in
some vigor, whether they would or no. Now this being implanted in the minds of all men by nature,
cannot be false, for nature imprints not in the minds of all men an assent to a falsity. Nature would not
pervert the reason and minds of men. Universal notions of God are from original, not lapsed nature, and
preserved in mankind in order to a restoration from a lapsed state. The heathens did acknowledge this: in
all the solemn covenants, selemnized with oaths and the invocation of the name of God, this attribute was
supposed.677 They confessed knowledge to be peculiar to the Deity; scientia deorum vita, saith Cicero.
Some called him Νοῦς, mens, mind, pure understanding, without any note, ̓Επόπιης, the inspector of all. As
they called him life, because he was the author of life, so they called him intellectus, because he was the
author of all knowledge and understanding in his creatures; and one being asked, whether any man could
be hid from God? Do, saith he, not so much as thinking.678 Some call him the eye of the world; and the
Egyptians represented God by an eye on the top of a sceptre, because God is all eye, and can be ignorant
of nothing.
</p>
<p>
     And the same nation made eyes and ears of the most excellent metals, consecrating them to God, and
hanging them up in the midst of their temples, in signification of God’s seeing and hearing all things;
hence they called God light, as well as the Scripture, because all things are visible to him.
</p>
<p>
     For the better understanding of this, we will enquire, I. What kind of knowledge or understanding
there is in God. II. What God knows. III. How God knows things. IV. The proof that God knows all
things. V. The use of all to ourselves.
</p>
<p>
     I. What kind of understanding or knowledge there is in God. The knowledge of God in Scripture hath
various names, according to the various relations or objects of it: in respect of present things, it is called
knowledge or sight; in respect of things past, remembrance; in respect of things future, or to come, it is
called foreknowledge, or prescience (1 Pet. 1:2); in regard of the universality of the objects, it is called
omniscience; in regard to the simple understanding of things, it is called knowledge; in regard of acting
and modelling the ways of acting, it is called wisdom and prudence (Eph. 1:8). He must have knowledge,
otherwise he could not be wise; wisdom is the flower of knowledge, and knowledge is the root of
wisdom. As to what this knowledge is, if we know what knowledge is in man, we may apprehend what it
is in God, removing all imperfection from it, and ascribing to him the most eminent way of
understanding; because we cannot comprehend God, but as he is pleased to condescend to us in his own
ways of discovery, that is, under some way of similitude to his perfectest creatures, therefore we have a
notion of God by his understanding and will; understanding, whereby he conceives and apprehends
things; will, whereby he extends himself in acting according to his wisdom, and whereby he doth approve
or disapprove; yet we must not measure his understanding by our own, or think it to be of so gross a
temper as a created mind; that he hath eyes of flesh, or sees or knows as man sees (Job 10:4). We can no
more measure his knowledge by ours than we can measure his essence by our essence. As he hath an
incomprehensible essence, to which ours is but as a drop of a bucket, so he hath an incomprehensible
knowledge, to which ours is but as a grain of dust, or mere darkness: his thoughts are above our thoughts,
as the heavens are above the earth. The knowledge of God is variously divided by the schools, and
acknowledged by all divines.
</p>
<p>
     1. A knowledge visionis et simplicis intelligentiæ; the one we may call a sight, the other an
understanding; the one refers to sense, the other to the mind. (1.) A knowledge of vision or sight. Thus
God knows himself and all things that really were, are, or shall be in time; all those things which he hath
decreed to be, though they are not yet actually sprung up in the world, but lie couchant in their causes. (2.)
A knowledge of intelligence or simple understanding. The object of this is not things that are in being, or
that shall by any decree of God ever be existent in the world, but such things as are possible to be wrought
by the power of God, though they shall never in the least peep up into being, but lie forever wrapt up in
darkness and nothing.679 This also is a necessary knowledge to be allowed to God, because the object of
this knowledge is necessary. The possibility of more creatures than ever were or shall be, is a conclusion
that hath a necessary truth in it; as it is necessary that the power of God can produce more creatures,
though it be not necessary that it should produce more creatures, so it is necessary that whatsoever the
power of God can work, is possible to be. And as God knows this possibility, so he knows all the objects
that are thus possible; and herein doth much consist the infiniteness of his knowledge, as shall be shown
presently. These two kinds of knowledge differ; that of vision, is of things which God hath decreed to be,
though they are not yet; that of intelligence is of things which never shall be; yet they may be, or are
possible to be, if God please to will and order their being; one respects things that shall be, the other,
things that may be, and are not repugnant to the nature of God to be. The knowledge of vision follows the
act of God’s will, and supposeth an act of God’s will before, decreeing things to be. (If we could suppose
any first or second in God’s decree, we might say God knew them as possible before he decreed them; he
knew them as future, because he decreed them.) For without the will of God decreeing a thing to come to
pass, God cannot know that it will infallibly come to pass. But the knowledge of intelligence stands
without any act of his will, in order to the being of those things he knows; he knows possible things only
in his power; he knows other things both in his power as able to effect them, and in his will, as
determining the being of them; such knowledge we must grant to be in God, for there is such a kind of
knowledge in man; for man doth not oft know and see what is before his eyes in this world, but he may
have a conception of many more worlds, and many more creatures, which he knows are possible to the
power of God.
</p>
<p>
    2. There is a speculative and practical knowledge in God. (1.) A speculative knowledge is, when the
truth of a thing is known without a respect to any working or practical operation. The knowledge of things
possible is in God only speculative,680 and some say God’s knowledge of himself is only speculative,
because there is nothing for God to work in himself: and though he knows himself, yet this knowledge of
himself doth not terminate there, but flowers into a love of himself, and delight in himself; yet this love of
himself, and delight in himself, is not enough to make it a practical knowledge, because it is natural, and
naturally and necessarily flows from the knowledge of himself and his own goodness: he cannot but love
himself, and delight in himself, upon the knowledge of himself. But that which is properly practice, is
where there is a dominion over the action, and it is wrought not naturally and necessarily, but in a way of
freedom and counsel. As when we see a beautiful flower or other thing, there ariseth a delight in the mind;
this no man will call practice, because it is a natural affection of the will, arising from the virtue of the
object, without any consideration of the understanding in a practical manner by counselling, commanding,
&amp;c. (2.) A practical knowledge: which tends to operation and practice, and is the principle of working
about things that are known; as the knowledge an artificer hath in an art or mystery. This knowledge is in
God: the knowledge he hath of the things he hath decreed, is such a kind of knowledge; for it terminates
in the act of creation, which is not a natural and necessary act, as the loving himself, and delighting in
himself is, but wholly free: for it was at his liberty whether he would create them or no; this is called
discretion (Jer. 10:12): “He hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.” Such also is his knowledge
of the things he hath created, and which are in being, for it terminates in the government of them for his
own glorious ends. It is by this knowledge “the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down their
dew” (Prov. 3:20). This is a knowledge whereby he knows the essence, qualities, and properties of what
he creates and governs in order to his own glory, and the common good of the world over which he
resides; so that speculative knowledge is God’s knowledge of himself and things possible; practical
knowledge is his knowledge of his creatures and things governable; yet in some sort this practical
knowledge is not only of things that are made, but of things which are possible, which God might make,
though he will not: for as he knows that they can be created, so he knows how they are to be created, and
how to be governed, though he never will create them. This is a practical knowledge for it is not requisite
to constitute a knowledge practical, actually to act, but that the knowledge in itself be referable to
action.681
</p>
<p>
    3. There is a knowledge of approbation, as well as apprehension. This the Scripture often mentions.
Words of understanding are used to signify the acts of affection. This knowledge adds to the simple act of
the understanding, the complacency and pleasure of the will, and is improperly knowledge, because it
belongs to the will, and not to the understanding; only it is radically in the understanding, because
affection implies knowledge: men cannot approve of that which they are ignorant of. Thus knowledge is
taken (Amos 3:2), “You only have I known of all the families of the earth”; and (2 Tim. 2:19), “The Lord
knows who are his,” that is, he loves them; he doth not only know them, but acknowledges them for his
own. It notes, not only an exact understanding, but a special care of them; and so is that to be understood
(Gen. 1.), “God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good:” that is, he saw it with an
eye of approbation, as well as apprehension. This is grounded upon God’s knowledge of vision, his sight
of his creatures; for God doth not love or delight in anything but what is actually in being, or what he hath
decreed to bring into being. On the contrary, also, when God doth not approve, he is said not to know
(Matt. 25:12), “I know you not,” and (Matt. 7:23), “I never knew you;” he doth not approve of their
works. It is not an ignorance of understanding, but an ignorance of will; for while he saith he never knew
them, he testifies that he did know them, in rendering the reason of his disapproving them, because he
knows all their works: so he knows them, and doth not know them in a different manner: he knows them
so as to understand them, but he doth not know them so as to love them. We must, then, ascribe an
universal knowledge to God. If we deny him a speculative knowledge, or knowledge of intelligence, we
destroy his Deity, we make him ignorant of his own power: if we deny him practical knowledge, we deny
ourselves to be his creatures; for, as his creatures, we are the fruits of this, his discretion, discovered in
creation: if we deny his knowledge of vision, we deny his governing dominion. How can he exercise a
sovereign and uncontrollable dominion, that is ignorant of the nature and qualities of the things he is to
govern? If he had not knowledge he could make no revelation; he that knows not cannot dictate; we could
then have no Scripture. To deny God knowledge, is to dash out the Scripture, and demolish the Deity.
God is described in Zech. 3:9, “with seven eyes,” to show his perfect knowledge of all things, all
occurrences in the world; and the cherubims, or whatsoever is meant by the wings, are described to be full
of eyes, both “before and behind” (Ezek. 1:18), round about them; much more is God all eye, all ear, all
understanding. The sun is a natural image of God; if the sun had an eye, it would see; if it had an
understanding, it would know all visible things; it would see what it shines upon, and understand what it
influenceth, in the most obscure bowels of the earth. Doth God excel his creature, the sun, in excellency
and beauty, and not in light and understanding? certainly more than the sun excels an atom or grain of
dust. We may yet make some representation of this knowledge of God by a lower thing, a picture, which
seems to look upon every one, though there be never so great a multitude in the room where it hangs; no
man can cast his eye upon it, but it seems to behold him in particular, and so exactly, as if there were none
but him upon whom the eye of it were fixed; and every man finds the same cast of it: shall art frame a
thing of that nature, and shall not the God of art and all knowledge, be much more in reality than that is in
imagination? Shall not God have a far greater capacity to behold everything in the world, which is
infinitely less to him than a wide room to a picture?
</p>
<p>
    II. The second thing, What God knows; how far his understanding reaches.
</p>
<p>
    1. God knows himself, and only knows himself. This is the first and original knowledge, wherein he
excels all creatures. No man doth exactly know himself; much less doth he understand the full nature of a
spirit; much less still the nature and perfections of God; for what proportion can there be between a finite
faculty and an infinite object? Herein consists the infiniteness of Gods knowledge, that he knows his own
essence, that he knows that which is unknowable to any else. It doth not so much consist in knowing the
creatures, which he hath made, as in knowing himself, who was never made. It is not so much infinite,
because he knows all things which are in the world, or that shall be; or things that he can make, because
the number of them is finite; but because he hath a perfect and comprehensive knowledge of his own
infinite perfections.682 Though it be said that angels “see his face” (Matt. 18:10), that sight notes rather
their immediate attendance, than their exact knowledge; they see some signs of his presence and majesty,
more illustrious and express than ever appeared to man in this life; but the essence of God is invisible to
them, hid from them in the secret place of eternity; none knows God but himself (1 Cor. 2:11): “What
man knows the things of a man save the spirit of a man? so the things of God knows no man but the Spirit
of God; the Spirit of God searches the deep things of God;” searcheth, that is, exactly knows, thoroughly
understands, as those who have their eyes in every chink and crevice, to see what lies hid there; the word
search notes not an inquiry, but an exact knowledge, such as men have of things upon a diligent scrutiny
as when God is said to search the heart and the reins, it doth not signify a precedent ignorance, but an
exact knowledge of the most intimate corners of the hearts of men. As the conceptions of men are
unknown to any but themselves, so the depths of the divine essence, perfections, and decrees, are
unknown to any but to God himself; he only knows what he is, and what he knows, what he can do, and
what he hath decreed to do. For first, if God did not know himself, he would not be perfect. It is the
perfection of a creature to know itself, much more a perfection belonging to God. If God did not
comprehend himself, he would want an infinite perfection, and so would cease to be God, in being
defective in that which intellectual creatures in some measure possess. As God is the most perfect being,
so he must have the most perfect understanding: if he did not understand himself, he would be under the
greatest ignorance, because he would he ignorant of the most excellent object. Ignorance is the
imperfection of the understanding; and ignorance of one’s self is a greater imperfection than ignorance of
things without. If God should know all things without himself, and not know himself, he would not have
the most perfect knowledge, because he would not have the knowledge of the best of objects. Secondly,
Without the knowledge of himself, he could not be blessed. Nothing can have any complacency in itself,
without knowledge of itself. Nothing can in a rational manner enjoy itself, without understanding itself.
The blessedness of God consists not in the knowledge of anything without him, but in the knowledge of
himself and his own excellency, as the principle of all things; if, therefore, he did not perfectly know
himself and his own happiness, he could not enjoy a happiness; for to be, and not to know to be, is as if a
thing were not. “He is God, blessed forever” (Rom. 9:5.), and therefore forever had a knowledge of
himself. Thirdly, Without the knowledge of himself, he could create nothing. For he would be ignorant of
his own power, and his own ability; and he that doth not know how far his power extends, could not act: if
he did not know himself, he could know nothing; and he that knows nothing, can do nothing; he could not
know an effect to be possible to him, unless he knew his own power as a cause. Fourthly, Without the
knowledge of himself, he could govern nothing. He could not, without the knowledge of his own holiness
and righteousness, prescribe laws to men, nor without a knowledge of his own nature order himself a
manner of worship suitable to it. All worship must be congruous to the dignity and nature of the object
worshipped: he must therefore know his own authority, whereby worship was to be enacted; his own
excellency, to which worship was to be suited; his own glory, to which worship was to be directed. If he
did not know himself, he did not know what to punish, because he would not know what was contrary to
himself: not knowing himself, he would not know what was a contempt of him, and what an adoration of
him; what was worthy of God, and what was unworthy of him. In fine, he could not know other things,
unless he knew himself; unless he knew his own power, he could not know how he created things; unless
he knew his own wisdom, he could not know the beauty of his works; unless he knew his own glory, he
could not know the end of his works; unless he knew his own holiness, he could not know what was evil;
and unless he knew his own justice, he could not know how to punish the crimes of his offending
creatures. And, therefore,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) God knows himself, because his knowledge, with his will, is the cause of all other things that can
fall under his cognizance he knows himself first, before he can know any other thing; that is, first
according to our conceptions; for, indeed God knows himself and all other things at once; he is the first
truth, and therefore is the first object of his own understanding. There is nothing more excellent than
himself, and therefore nothing more known to him than himself. As he is all knowledge, so he hath in
himself the most excellent object of knowledge. To understand, is properly to know one’s self. No object
is so intelligible to God as God is to himself, nor so intimately and immediately joined with his
understanding as himself; for his understanding is his essence, himself.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) He knows himself by his own essence. He knows not himself and his own power by the effect,
because he knows himself from eternity, before there was a world, or any, effect of his power extant. It is
not a knowledge by the cause, for God hath no cause; nor a knowledge of himself by any species, or
anything from without: if it were anything from without himself, that must be created or untreated; if
uncreated it would be God; and so we must either own many Gods, or own, it to be his essence, and so not
distinct from himself: if created, then his knowledge of himself would depend upon a creature: he could
not, then, know himself from eternity, but in time, because nothing can be created from eternity, but in
time. God knows not himself by any faculty, for there is no composition in God; he is not made up of
parts, but is a simple being; some, therefore, have called God, not intellectus, understanding, because that
savors of a faculty, but intellectio, intellection: God is all act in the knowledge of himself and his
knowledge of other things.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) God, therefore, knows himself perfectly, comprehensively. Nothing in his own nature is concealed
from him; he reflects apon everything that he is.683 There is a positive comprehension, so God doth not
comprehend himself; for what is comprehended hath bounds, and what is comprehended by itself is finite
to itself; and there is a negative comprehension—God so comprehends himself; nothing in his own nature
is obscure to him, unknown by him; for there is as great a perfection in the understanding of God to know,
as there is in the divine nature to be known. The understanding of God, and the nature of God, are both
infinite, and so equal to one another: his understanding is equal to himself; he knows himself so well, that
nothing can be known by him more perfectly than himself is known to himself. He knows himself in the
highest manner, because nothing is so proportioned to the understanding of God as himself. He knows his
own essence, goodness, power; all his perfections, decrees, intentions, acts, the infinite capacity of his
own understanding, so that nothing of himself is in the dark to himself: and, in this respect, some use this
expression, that the infiniteness of God is in a manner finite to himself, because it is comprehended by
himself. Thus God transcends all creatures; thus his understanding is truly infinite, because nothing but
himself is an infinite object for it: what angels may understand of themselves perfectly I know not, but no
creature in the world understands himself. Man understands not fully the excellency and parts of his own
nature; upon God’s knowledge of himself depends the comfort of his people, and the terror of the wicked:
this is also a clear argument for, his knowledge of all other things without himself; he that knows himself,
must needs know all other things less than himself, and which were made by himself; when the
knowledge of his own immensity and infiniteness is not an object too difficult for him, the knowledge of a
finite and limited creature, in all his actions, thoughts, circumstances, cannot be too hard for him: since he
knows himself, who is infinite, he cannot but know whatsoever is finite. This is the foundation of all his
other knowledge; the knowledge of everything present, past, and to come, is far less than the knowledge
of himself. He is more incomprehensible in his own nature, than all things created, or that can be created,
put together can be. If he, then, have a perfect comprehensive knowledge of his own nature, any
knowledge of all other things is less than the knowledge of himself; this ought to be well considered by
us, as the fountain whence all his other knowledge flows.
</p>
<p>
     2. Therefore God knows all other things, whether they be possible, past, present, or future; whether
they be things that he can do, but will never do, or whether they be things that he hath done, but are not
now; things that are now in being, or things that are not now existing, that lie in the womb of their proper
and immediate causes.684 If his understanding be infinite, he then knows all things whatsoever that can be
known, else his understanding would have bounds, and what hath limits is not infinite, but finite. If he be
ignorant of any one thing that is knowable, that is a bound to him, it comes with an exception, a but, God
knows all things but this; a bar is then set to his knowledge. If there were anything, any particular
circumstance in the whole creation or non-creation, and possible to be known by him, and yet were
unknown to him, he could not be said to be omniscient; as he would not be Almighty if any one thing, that
implied not a repugnancy to his nature, did transcend his power.
</p>
<p>
     First, All things possible. No question but God knows what he could create, as well as what he hath
created; what he would not create, as well as what he resolved to create; he knew what he would not do
before he willed to do it; this is the next thing which declares the infiniteness of his understanding; for, as
his power is infinite, and can create innumerable worlds and creatures, so is his knowedge infinite, in
knowing innumerable things possible to his power. Possibles are infinite; that is, there is no end of what
God can do, and therefore no end of what God doth know; otherwise his power would be more infinite
than his knowledge: if he knew only what is created, there would be an end of his understanding, because
all creatures may be numbered, but possible things cannot be reckoned up by any creature. There is the
same reason of this in eternity; when never so many numbers of years are run out, there is still more to
come, there still wants an end; and when millions of worlds are created, there is no more an end of God’s
power than of eternity. Thus there is no end of his understanding; that is, his knowledge is not terminated
by anything. This the Scripture gives us some account of: God knows things that are not, “for he calls
things that are not as if they were” (Rom. 4:17); he calls things that are not, as if they were in being; what
he calls is not unknown to him: if he knows things that are not, he knows things that may never be; as he
knows things that shall be, because he wills them, so he knows things that might be, because he is able to
effect them: he knew that the inhabitants of Keilah would betray David to Saul if he remained in that
place (1 Sam. 23:11); he knew what they would do upon that occasion, though it was never done; as he
knew what was in their power and in their wills, so he must needs know what is within the compass of his
own power; as he can permit more than he doth permit so he knows what he can permit, and what, upon
that permission, would be done by his creatures; so God knew the possibility of the Tyrians’ repentance,
if they had had the same means, heard the same truths, and beheld the same miracles which were offered
to the ears, and presented to the eyes of the Jews (Matt. 11:21). This must needs be so, because,
</p>
<p>
     1. Man knows things that are possible to him, though he will never effect them. A carpenter knows a
house in the model he hath of it in his head, though he never build a house according to that model. A
watch-maker hath the frame of a watch in his mind, which he will never work with his instruments; man
knows what he could do, though he never intends to do it.685 As the understanding of man hath a virtue,
that where it sees one man it may imagine thousands of men of the same shape, stature, form, parts; yea,
taller, more vigorous, sprightly, intelligent, than the man he sees; because it is possible such a number
may be. Shall not the understanding of God much more know what he is able to effect, since the
understanding of man can know what he is never able to produce, yet may be produced by God, viz. that
he who produced this man which I see, can produce a thousand exactly like him? If the Divine
understanding did not know infinite things, but were confined to a certain number, it may be demanded
whether God can understand anything farther than that number, or whether he cannot? If he can, then he
doth actually understand all those things which he hath a power to understand; otherwise there would be
an increase of God’s knowledge, if it were actually now, and not before, and so he would be more perfect
than he was before; if he cannot understand them, then he cannot understand what a human mind can
understand; for our understandings can multiply numbers in in infinitum; and there is no number so great,
but a man can still add to it: we must suppose the divine understanding more excellent in knowledge. God
knows all that a man can imagine, though it never were, nor never shall be; he must needs know
whatsoever is in the power of man to imagine or think, because God concurs to the support of the faculty
in that imagination; and though it may be replied, an atheist may imagine that there is no God, a man may
imagine that God can lie, or that he can be destroyed; doth God know therefore that he is not? or that he
can lie, or cease to be? No, he knows he cannot; his knowledge extends to things possible, not to things
impossible to himself; he knows it as imaginable by man, not as possible in itself; because it is utterly
impossible, and repugnant to the nature of God,686 since he eminently contains in hmself all things
possible, past, present, and to come; he cannot know himself without knowing them.
</p>
<p>
     2. God knowing his own power, knows whatsoever is in his power to effect. If he knows not all things
possible, he could not know the extent of his own power, and so would not know himself, as a cause
sufficient for more things than he hath created. How can he comprehend himself, who comprehends not
all effluxes of things possible that may come from him, and be wrought by him? How can he know
himself as a cause, if he know not the objects and works which he is able to produce?687 Since the power
of God extends to numberless things, his knowledge also extends to numberless objects; as if a unit is,
could see the numbers it could produce, it would see infinite numbers: for a unit, as it were, all number.
God knowing the fruitfulness of his own virtue, knows a numberless multitude of things which he can do,
more than have been done, or shall be done by him; he therefore knows innumerable worlds, innumerable
angels, with higher perfections, than any of them which he hath created have: so that if the world should
last many millions of years, God knows that he can every day create another world more capacious than
this; and having created an inconceivable number, he knows he could still create more: so that he beholds
infinite worlds, infinite numbers of men, and other creatures in himself, infinite kinds of things, infinite
species, and individuals under those kinds, even as many as he can create, if his will did order and
determine it; for not being ignorant of his own power, he cannot be ignorant of the effects wherein it may
display and discover itself. A comprehensive knowledge of his own power doth necessarily include the
objects of that power; so he knows whatsoever he could effect, and whatsoever he could permit, if he
pleased to do it. If God could not understand more than he hath created, he could not create more than he
hath created: for it cannot be conceived how he can create anything that he is ignorant of; what he doth
not know, he cannot do: he must know also the extent of his own goodness, and how far anything is
capable to partake of it: so much therefore, as any detract from the knowledge of God, they detract from
his, power.
</p>
<p>
    3. It is further evident that God knows all possible things, because he knew those things which he has
created, before they were created, when they were yet in a possibility. If God knew things before they
were created, he knew them when they were in a possibility, and not in actual reality. It is absurd to
imagine that his understanding did lackey after the creatures, and draw knowledge from them after they
were created. It is absurd to think that God did create, before he knew what he could or would create. If he
knew those things he did create when they were possible, he must know all things which he can create,
and therefore all things that are possible. To conclude this, we must consider that this knowledge is of
another kind than his knowledge of things that are or shall be. He sees possible things as possible, not as
things that ever are or shall be. If he saw them as existing or future, and they shall never be, this
knowledge would be false, there would be a deceit in it, which cannot be. He knows. those things not in
themselves, because they are not, nor in their causes, because they shall never be: he knows them in his
own power, not in his will: he understands them as able to produce them, not as willing to effect them.
Things possible he knows only in his power; things future he knows both in his power and his will, as he
is both able and determined in his own good pleasure to give being to them. Those that shall never come
to pass, he knows only in himself as a sufficient cause; those things that shall come into being, he knows
in himself as the efficient cause, and also in their immediate second causes. This should teach us to spend
our thoughts in the admiration of the excellency of God, and the divine knowledge; his understanding is
infinite.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, God knows all things past. This is an argument used by God himself to elevate his
excellency above all the commonly adored idols (Isa. 41:22): “Let them show the former things, what
they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them.” He knows them as if they were
now present, and not past for indeed in his eternity there is nothing past or future to his knowledge. This
is called remembrance, in Scripture, as when God remembered Rachel’s prayer for a child (Gen. 30:22),
and he is said to put tears into his bottle, and write them in his book of accompts, which signifies the exact
and unerring knowledge in God of the minute circumstances past in the world; and this knowledge is
called a book of remembrance (Mal. 3:16), signifying the perpetual presence of things past, before him.
There are two elegant expressions, signifying the certainty and perpetuity of God’s knowledge of sins past
(Job 14:17), “My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity;” a metaphor,
taken from men that put up in a bag the money they would charily keep, tie the bag, sew up the holes, and
bind it hard, that nothing may fall out; or a vessel, wherein they reserve liquors, and daub it with pitch and
glutinous stuff, that nothing may leak out, but be safely kept till the time of use; or else, as some think,
from the bags attornies carry with them, full of writings, when they are to manage a cause against a
person. Thus we find God often in Scripture calling to men’s minds their past actions, upbraiding them
with their ingratitude, wherein he testifies his remembrance of his own past benefits and their crimes. His
knowledge in this regard hath something of infinity in it, since though the sins of all men that have been
in the world are finite in regard of number, yet when the sins of one man in thoughts, words, and deeds,
are numberless in his own account, and perhaps in the count of any creature, the sins of all the vast
numbers of men that have been, or shall be, are much more numberless, it cannot be less than infinite
knowledge that can make a collection of them, and take a survey of them all at once. If past things had not
been known by God, how could Moses have been acquainted with the original of things? How could he
have declared the former transactions, wherein all histories are silent but the Scripture? How could he
know the cause of man’s present misery so many ages after, wherewith all philosophy was unacquainted?
How could he have writ the order of the creation, the particulars of the sin of Adam, the circumstances of
Cain’s murder, the private speech of Lamech to his wives, if God had not revealed them? And how could
a revelation be made, if things past were forgotten by him? Do we not remember many things done
among men, as well as by ourselves, and reserve the forms of divers things in our minds, which rise as
occasions are presented to draw them forth? And shall not God much more, who hath no cloud of
darkness upon his understanding? A man that makes a curious picture, hath the form of it in his mind
before he made it; and if the fire burn it, the form of it in his mind is not destroyed by the fire, but retained
in it. God’s memory is no less perfect than his understanding. If he did not know things past, he could not
be a righteous Governor, or exercise any judicial act in a righteous manner; he could not dispense rewards
and punishments, according to his promises and threatenings, if things that were past could be forgotten
by him; he could not require that which is past (Eccles. 3:15), if he did not remember that which is past.
And though God be said to forget in Scripture, and not to know his people, and his people pray to him to
remember them, as if he had forgotten them (Psalm 119:49), this is improperly ascribed to God.688 As
God is said to repent, when he changes things according to his counsel beyond the expectation of men, so
he is said to forget, when he defers the making good his promise to the godly, or his threatenings to the
wicked; this is not a defect of memory belonging to his mind, but an act of his will. When he is said to
remember his covenant, it is to will grace according to his covenant; when he is said to forget his
covenant, it is to intercept the influences of it, whereby to punish the sin of his people; and when he is
said not to know his people, it is not an absolute forgetfulness of them, but withdrawing from them the
testimonies of his kindness, and clouding the signs of his favor; so God in pardon is said to forget sin, not
that he ceaseth to know it, but ceaseth to punish it. It is not to be meant of a simple forgetfulness, or a
lapse of his memory, but of a judicial forgetfulness; so when his people in Scripture pray, Lord, remember
thy word unto thy servant, no more is to be understood but, Lord, fulfil thy word and promise to thy
servant.
</p>
<p>
     Thirdly, He knows things present (Heb. 4:13): “All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him
with whom we have to do;” this is grounded upon the knowledge of himself; it is not so difficult to know
all creatures exactly, as to know himself, because they are finite, but himself is infinite; he knows his own
power, and therefore everything through which his omnipotence is diffused, all the acts and objects of it;
not the least thing that is the birth of his power, can be concealed from him; he knows his own goodness,
and therefore every object upon which the warm beams of his goodness strike; he therefore knows
distinctly the properties of every creature, because every property in them is a ray of his goodness; he is
not only the efficient, but the exemplary cause; therefore as he knows all that his power hath wrought, as
he is the efficient, so he knows them in himself as the pattern; as a carpenter can give an account of every
part and passage in a house he hath built, by consulting the model in his own mind, whereby he built it.
“He looked upon all things after he had made them, and pronounced them good” (Gen. 1:3), full of a
natural goodness he had endowed them with: he did not ignorantly pronounce them so, and call them
good, whether he knew them or not; and therefore he knows them in particular, as he knew them all in
their first presence. Is there any, reason he should be ignorant of everything now present in the world, or
that anything that derives an existence from him as a free cause, should be concealed from him? If he did
not know things present in their particularities, many things would be known by man, yea, by beasts,
which the infinite God were ignorant of; and if he did not know all things present, but only some, it is
possible for the most blessed God to be deceived and be miserable: ignorance is a calamity to the
understanding: he could not prescribe laws to his creatures, unless he knew their natures to which those
laws were to be suited: no, not natural ordinances to the sun, moon, and heavenly bodies, and inanimate
creatures, unless he knew the vigor and virtue in them, to execute those ordinances; for to prescribe laws
above the nature of things, is inconsistent with the wisdom of government; he must know how far they
were able to obey; whether the laws were suited to their ability: and for his rational creatures, whether the
punishments annexed to the law were proper, and suited to the transgression of the creature.
</p>
<p>
    1. He knows all creatures from the highest to the lowest, the least as well as the greatest. He knows the
ravens and their young ones (Job 38:41); the drops of rain and dew which he hath begotten (Job 38:29);
every bird in the air, as well as any man doth what he hath in a cage at home (Psalm 50:11): “I know all
the fowls in the mountains, and the wild beasts in the field;” which some read creeping things. The clouds
are numbered in his wisdom (Job 38:37); every worm in the earth, every drop of rain that falls upon the
ground, the flakes of snow, and the knots of hail, the sands upon the sea-shore, the hairs upon the head; it
is no more absurd to imagine that God knows them, than that God made them; they are all the effects of
his power, as well as the stars which he calls by their names, as well as the most glorious angel and
blessed spirit; he knows them as well as if there were none but them in particular for him to know; the
least things were framed by his art as well as the greatest; the least things partake of his goodness as well
as the greatest; he knows his own arts, and his own goodness, and therefbre all the stamps and
impressions of them upon all his creatures; he knows the immediate causes of the least, and therefore the
effects of those causes. Since his knowledge is infinite, it must extend to those things which are at the
greatest distance from him, to those which approach nearest to not being; since he did not want power to
create, he cannot want understanding to know everything he hath created, the dispositions, qualities, and
virtues of the minutest creature. Nor is the understanding of God embased, and suffers a diminution by the
knowledge of the vilest and most inconsiderable things. Is it not an imperfection to be ignorant of the
nature of anything? and can God have such a defect in his most perfect understanding? Is the
understanding of man of an impurer alloy by knowing the nature of the rankest poisons? by understanding
a fly, or a small insect? or by considering the deformity of a toad? Is it not generally counted a note of a
dignifled mind to be able to discourse of the nature of them? Was Solomon, who knew all from the cedar
to the hyssop, debased by so rich a present of wisdom from his Creator? Is any glass defiled by presenting
a deformed image? Is there anything more vile than the “imaginations, which are only evil, and
continually?” Doth not the mind of man descend to the mud of the earth, play the adulterer or idolater
with mean objects, suck in the most unclean things? yet God knows these in all their circumstances, in
every appearance, inside and outside. Is there anything viler than some thoughts of men? than some
actions of men? their unclean beds and gluttonous vomiting, and Luciferian pride? yet do not these fall
under the eye of God, in all their nakedness? The Second Person’s taking human nature, though it
obscured, yet it did not disparage the Deity, or bring any disgrace to it. Is gold the worse for being formed
into the image of a fly? doth it not still retain the nobleness of the metal? When men are despised for
descending to the knowledge of mean and vile things, it is because they neglect the knowledge of the
greater, and sin in their inquiries after lesser things, with a neglect of that which concerns more the honor
of God and the happiness of themselves; to be ambitious of such a knowledge, and careless of that of
more concern, is criminal and contemptible. But God knows the greatest as well as the least; mean things
are not known by him to exclude the knowledge of the greater; nor are vile things governed by him to
exclude the order of the better. The deformity of objects known by God doth not deform him, nor defile
him; he doth not view them without himself, but within himself, wherein all things in their ideas are
beautiful and comely: our knowledge of a deformed thing is not a deforming of our understanding, but is
beautiful in the knowledge, though it be not in the object; nor is there any fear that the understanding of
God should become material by knowing material things, any more than our understandings lose their
spirituality by knowing the nature of bodies; it is to be observed, therefore, that only those senses of men,
as seeing, hearing, smelling, which have those qualities for their objects that come nearest the nature of
spiritual things, as light, sounds, fragrant odors, are ascribed to God in Scripture; not touching or tasting,
which are senses that are not exercised without a more immediate commerce with gross matter; and the
reason may be, because we should have no gross thoughts of God, as if he were a body, and made of
matter, like the things he knows.

<p>
     2. As he knows all creatures, so God knows all the actions of creatures. He counts in particular all the
ways of men. “Doth he not see all my ways, and count all my steps” (Job 31:4)? He “tells” their
“wanderings,” as if one by one (Psalm 56:8). “His eyes are upon all the ways of man, and he sees all his
goings” (Job 34:21); a metaphor taken from men, when they look wistly, with fixed eyes upon a thing, to
view it in every circumstance, whence it comes, whether it goes, to observe every little motion of it.
God’s eye is not a wandering, but a fixed eye; and the ways of man are not only “before his eyes,” but he
doth exactly “ponder them” (Prov. 5:21); as one that will not be ignorant of the least mite in them, but
weigh and examine them by the standard of his law; he may as well know the motions of our members, as
the hairs of our heads; the smallest actions before they be, whether civil, natural, or religious, fall under
his cognizance; what meaner than a man carrying a pitcher, yet our Saviour foretels it (Luke 22:10); God
knows not only what men do, but what they would have done, had he not restrained them; what
Abimelech would have done to Sarah, had not God put a bar in his way (Gen. 20:6); what a man that is
taken away in his youth would have done, had he lived to a riper age; yea, he knows the most secret
words as well as actions; the words spoken by the king of Israel in his bed-chamber, were revealed to
Elisha (2 Kings 6:12); and indeed, how can any action of man be concealed from God? Can we view the
various actions of a heap of ants, or a hive of bees in a glass, without turning our eyes; and shall not God
behold the actions of all men in the world, which are less than bees or ants in his sight, and more visible
to him than an ant-hill or bee-hive can be to the acutest eye of man?
</p>
<p>
     3. As God knows all the actions of creatures, so he knows all the thoughts of creatures. The thoughts
are the most closeted acts of man, hid from men and angels, unless disclosed by some outward
expressions; but God descends into the depths and abysses of the soul, discerns the most inward
contrivances; nothing is impenetrable to him; the sun doth not so much enlighten the earth, as God
understands the heart; all things are as visible to him, as flies and motes enclosed in a body of transparent
crystal; this man naturally allows to God. Men often speak to God by the motions of their minds and
secret ejaculations, which they would not do, if it were not naturally implanted in them, that God knows
all their inward motions; the Scripture is plain and positive in this, “He tries the heart and the reins”
(Psalm 7:9), as men, by the use of fire, discern the drossy and purer parts of metals. The secret intentions
and aims, the most lurking affections seated in the reins; he knows that which no man, no angel, is able to
know, which a man himself knows not, nor makes any particular reflection upon; yea, “he weighs the
Spirit” (Prov. 16:2); he exactly numbers all the devices and inclinations of men, as men do every piece of
coin they tell out of a heap. “He discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Heb. 4:12); all that is in
the mind, all that is in the affections, every stirring and purpose; so that not one thought can be withheld
from him Job 42:2); yea, “Hell and destruction are before him, much more then the hearts of the children
of men” (Prov. 15:11); he works all things in the bowels of the earth, and brings forth all things out of that
treasure, say some; but more naturally, God knows the whole state of the dead, all the receptacles and
graves of their bodies, all the bodies of men consumed by the earth, or devoured by living creatures;
things that seem to be out of all being; he knows the thoughts of the devils and damned creatures, whom
he hath cast out of his care forever into the arms of his justice, never more to cast a delightful glance
towards them; not a secret in any soul in hell (which he hath no need to know, because he shall not judge
them by any of the thoughts they now have, since they were condemned to punishment) is hid from him;
much more is he acquainted with the thoughts of living men, the counsels of whose hearts are yet to be
manifested, in order to their trial and censure; yea, he knows them before they spring up into actual being
(Psalm 139:2): “Thou understandest my thoughts afar off;” my thoughts, that is, every thought; though
innumerable thoughts pass through me in a day, and that in the source and fountain, when it is yet in the
womb, before it is our thought; if he knows them before their existence, before they can be properly called
ours, much more doth he know them when they actually spring up in us: he knows the tendency of them;
where the bird will light when it is in flight; he knows them exactly, he is therefore called a “discerner” or
criticiser “of the heart” (Heb. 4:12), as a critic discerns every letter, point, and stop; he is more intimate
with us than our souls with our bodies, and hath more the possession of us than we have of ourselves; he
knows them by an inspection into the heart, not by the mediation of second causes, by the looks or
gestures of men, as men may discern the thoughts of one another. (1.) God discerns all good motions of
the mind and will. These he puts into men, and needs must God know his own act; he knew the son of
“Jeroboam to have some good thing in him towards the Lord God of Israel” (1 Kings 14:13); and the
integrity of David and Hezekiah; the freest motions of the will and affections to him: “Lord, thou knowest
that I love thee,” saith Peter (John 21:17). Love can be no more restrained, than the will itself can; a man
may make another to grieve and desire, but none can force another to love. (2.) God discerns all the evil
motions of the mind and will; “Every imagination of the heart” (Gen. 6:5); the vanity of “men’s thoughts”
(Psalm 94:11); their inward darkness, and deceitful disguises. No wonder that God, who fashioned the
heart, should understand the motions of it (Psalm 33:13, 15): “He looks from heaven and beholds all the
children of men; he fashioneth their hearts alike, and considers all their works.” Doth any man make a
watch, and yet be ignorant of its motion? Did God fling away the key to this secret cabinet, when he
framed it, and put off the power of unlocking it when he pleased? He did not surely frame it in such a
posture as that anything in it should be hid from his eye; he did not fashion it to be privileged from his
government; which would follow if he were ignorant of what was minted and coined in it. He could not
be a Judge to punish men, if the inward frames and principles of men’s actions were concealed from him;
an outward action may glitter to an outward eye, yet the secret spring be a desire of applause, and not the
fear and love of God. If the inward frames of the heart did lie covered from him in the secret recesses of
the heart; those plausible acts, which in regard of their principles, would merit a punishment, would meet
with a reward; and God should bestow happiness where he had denounced misery. As without the
knowledge of what is just, he could not be a wise Lawgiver, so without the knowledge of what is inwardly
committed, he could not be a righteous Judge: acts that are rotten in the spring, might be judged good by
the fair color and appearance. This is the glory of God at the last day, “to manifest the secrets of all
hearts” (1 Cor. 4:5); and the prophet Jeremiah links the power of judging and the prerogative of trying the
hearts together (Jer. 11:20): “But thou, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and
the heart;” and (Jer. 17:10): “I, the Lord, search, the heart, I try the reins;” to what end? even to “give
every man according to his way, and according to the fruit of his doings.” And, indeed, his binding up the
whole law with that command of not coveting, evidenceth that he will judge men by the inward affections
and frames of their hearts. Again, God sustains the mind of man in every act of thinking; in him we have
not only the principle of life, but every motion, the motion of our minds as well as of our members: “In
him we live and move,” &amp;c. (Acts 17:28). Since he supports the vigor of the faculty in every act, can he
be ignorant of those acts which spring from the faculty, to which he doth at that instant communicate
power and ability? Now this knowledge of the thoughts of men is,
</p>
<p>
    1st. An incommunicable property, belonging only to the Divine understanding. Creatures, indeed, may
know the thoughts of others by divine revelation, but not by themselves; no creature hath a key
immediately to open the minds of men, and see all that lodgeth there; no creature can fathom the heart by
the line of created knowledge.689 Devils may have a conjectural knowledge, and may guess at them, by
the acquaintance they have with the disposition and constitution of men, and the images they behold in
their fancies; and by some marks which an inward imagination may stamp upon the brain, blood, animal
spirits, face, &amp;c. But the knowing the thoughts merely as thought, without any impression by it, is a
royalty God appropriates to himself, as the main secret of his government, and a perfection declarative of
his Deity, as much as any else (Jer. 17:9, 10): “The heart of man is desperately wicked, who can know it?”
yes, there is one, and but one, “I, the Lord, search the heart, I try the reins.” “Man looks on the outward
appearance, but the Lord looks upon the heart” (1 Sam. 16:7); where God is distinguished by this
perfection from all men whatsoever, others may know by revelation, as Elisha did what was in Gehazi’s
heart (2 Kings 5:26). But God knows a man more than any man knows himself; what person upon earth
understands the windings and turnings of his own heart, what reserves it will have, what contrivances,
what inclinations? all which God knows exactly.
</p>
<p>
    2d. God acquires no new knowledge of the thoughts and hearts by the discovery of them in the
actions. He would then be but equal in this part of knowledge to his creature; no man or angel but may
thus arrive to the knowledge of them; God were then excluded from an absolute dominion over the prime
work of his lower creation; he would have made a creature superior in this respect to himself, upon whose
will to discover, his knowledge of their inward intentions should depend; and therefore when God is said
to search the heart, we must not understand it as if God were ignorant before, and was fain to make an
exact scrutiny and inquiry, before he attained what he desired to know; but God condescends to our
capacity in the expression of his own knowledge, signifying that his knowledge is as complete as any
man’s knowledge can be of the designs of others, after he hath sifted them by a strict and thorough
examination, and wrung out a discovery of their intentions, that he knows them as perfectly as if he had
put them upon the rack, and and forced them to make a discovery of their secret plottings. Nor must we
understand that in Gen. 22:12, where God saith, after Abraham had stretched out his hand to sacrifice his
son, “Now I know that thou fearest God,” as though God was ignorant of Abraham’s gracious disposition
to him; did Abraham’s drawing his knife furnish God with a new knowledge? no, God knew Abraham’s
pious inclinations before (Gen. 18:19): “I know him, that he will command his children after him,” &amp;c.
Knowledge is sometimes taken for approbation; then the sense will be, Now I approve this fact as a
testimony of thy fear of me, since thy affection to thy Isaac is extinguished by the more powerful flame of
affection to my will and command; I now accept thee, and count thee a meet subject of my choicest
benefits: or, Now I know, that is, I have made known and manifested the faith of Abraham to himself and
to the world: thus Paul uses the word know (1 Cor. 2:2): “I have determined to know nothing;” that is, to
declare and teach nothing, to make known nothing but Christ crucified: or else, Now I know, that is, I
have an evidence and experiment in this noble fact, that thou fearest me. God often condescends to our
capacity in speaking of himself after the manner of men, as if he had (as men do) known the inward
affections of others by their outward actions.
</p>
<p>
    4. God knows all the evils and sins of creatures. (1.) God knows all sin. This follows upon the other. If
he knows all the actions and thoughts of creatures, he knows also all the sinfulness in those acts and
thoughts. This Zophar infers from God’s punishing men (Job 11:11); for he knows vain man, he sees his
wickedness also; he knows every man, and sees the wickedness of every man; he looks down from
heaven, and beholds not only the filthy persons, but what is filthy in them (Psalm 14:2, 3), all nations in
the world, and every man of every nation; none of their iniquity is hid from his eyes; he searches
Jerusalem with candles (Jer. 16:17). God follows sinners step by step, with his eye, and will not leave
searching out till he hath taken them; a metaphor taken from one that searches all chinks with a candle,
that nothing can be hid from him. He knows it distinctly in all the parts of it, how an adulterer rises out of
his bed to commit uncleanness, what contrivances he had, what steps he took, every circumstance in the
whole progress; not only evil in the bulk, but every one of the blacker spots upon it, which may most
aggravate it. If he did not know evil, how could he permit it, order it, punish it, or pardon it? Doth he
permit he knows not what? order to his own holy ends what he is ignorant of? punish or pardon that
which he is uncertain whether it be a crime or no? “Cleanse me,” saith David, “from my secret faults”
(Psalm 19:12), secret in regard of others, secret in regard of himself; how could God cleanse him from
that whereof he was ignorant? He knows sins before they are committed, much more when they are in act;
he foreknew the idolatry and apostacy of the Jews; what gods they would serve, in what measure they
would provoke him. and violate his covenant (Deut. 31:20, 21); he knew Judas’ sin long before Judas’
actual existence, foretelling it in the Psalms; and Christ predicts it before he acted it. He sees sins future in
his own permitting will; he sees sins present in his own supporting act. As he knows things possible to
himself, because he knows his own power so he knows things practicable by the creature, because he
knows the power and prmeiples of the creature.690 This sentiment of God is naturally written in the fears
of sinners, upon lightning, thunder, or some prodigious operation of God in the world; what is the
language of them, but that he sees their deeds, hears their words, knows the inward sinfulness of their
hearts; that he doth not only behold them as a mere spectator, but considers them as a just judge. And the
poets say, that the sins of men leaped into heaven, and were writ in parchments of Jupiter,691 scelus in
terram geritur, in cœlo scribitur: sin is acted on earth, and recorded in heaven. God indeed doth not
behold evil with the approving eye; he knows it not with a practical knowledge to be the author of it, but
with a speculative knowledge, so as to understand the sinfulness of it; or a knowledge simplicis
intelligentiœ, of simple intelligence, as he permits them, not positively wills them; he knows them not
with a knowledge of assent to them, but dissent from them. Evil pertains to a dissenting act of the mind,
and an aversive act of the will; and what though evil formerly taken, hath no distinct conception, because
it is a privation; a defect hath no being, and all knowledge is by the apprehension of some being; would
not this lie as strongly against our own knowledge of sin? Sin is a privation of the rectitude due to an act;
and who doubts man’s knowledge of sin? by his knowing the act, he knows the deficiency of the act; the
subject of evil hath a being, and so hath a conception in the mind; that which hath no being cannot be
known by itself, or in itself; but will it follow that it cannot be known by its contrary? as we know
darkness to be a privation of light, and folly to be a privation of wisdom. God knows good all by himself,
because he is the sovereign good; is it strange then, that he should know all evil, since all evil is in some
natural good. (2.) The manner of God’s knowing evil is not so easily known. And indeed, as we cannot
comprehend the essence of God, though it is easily intelligible that there is such a Being, so we can as
little comprehend the manner of God’s knowledge, though we cannot but conclude him to be an
intelligent Being, a pure understanding, knowing all things. As God hath a higher manner of being than
his creatures, so he hath another and higher manner of knowing; and we can as little comprehend the
manner of his knowing, as we can the manner of his being. But as to the manner, doth not God know his
own law? and shall he not know how much any action comes short of his rule? he cannot know his own
rule without knowing all the deviations from it. He knows his own holiness, and shall he not see how any
action is contrary to the holiness of his own nature? Doth not God know everything that is true? and is it
not true that this or that is evil? and shall God be ignorant of any truth? How doth God know that he
cannot lie, but by knowing his own veracity? How doth God know that he cannot die, but by knowing his
own immutability? and by knowing those, he knows what a lie is, he knows what death is; so if sin never
had been, if no creature had ever been, God would have known what sin was, because he knows his own
holiness; because he knew what law was fit to be appointed to his creatures if he should create them, and
that that law might be transgressed by them. God knows all good, all goodness in himself; he therefore
hath a foundation in himself to know all that comes short of that goodness, that is opposite to that
holiness: as if light were capable of understanding, it would know darkness only by knowing itself; by
knowing itself, it would know what is contrary to itself knows all created goodness which he hath planted
in the creature; he knows then all defects from this goodness, what perfection an act is deprived of; what
is opposite to that goodness, and that is evil. As we know sickness by health, discord by harmony,
blindness by sight, because it is a privation of sight, whosoever knows one contrary knows the other; God
knows unrighteousness by the idea which he hath of righteousness, and sees an act deprived of that
rectitude and goodness which ought to be in it; he knows evil because he knows the causes whence evil
proceeds.692 A painter knows a picture of his own framing, and if any one dashes any base color upon it,
shall not he also know that? God by his hand painted all creatures, impressed upon man the fair stamp and
color of his own image; the devil defiles it; man daubs it. Doth not God, that knows his own work, know
how this piece is become different from his work? Doth not God, that knows his creatures’ goodness,
which himself was the fountain of, know the change of this goodness? Yea, he knew before, that the devil
would sow tares where he had sown wheat; and therefore that controversy of some in the schools, whether
God knew evil by its opposition to created or uncreated goodness, is needless. We may say God knows
sin as it is opposite to created goodness, yet he knows it radically by his own goodness, because he knows
the goodness he hath communicated to the creature by his own essential goodness in himself. To conclude
this head: The knowledge of sin doth not bespot the holiness of God’s nature; for the bare knowledge of a
crime doth not infect the mind of man with the filth and pollution of that crime, for then every man that
knows an act of murder committed by another, would, by that bare knowledge, be tainted with his sin;
yea, and a judge that condemns a malefactor, may as well condemn himself if this were so: the knowledge
of sins infects not the understandings that knows them, but only the will that approves them. It is no
discredit to us to know evil, in order to pass a right judgment upon it; so neither can it be to God.
</p>
<p>
     Fourthly, God knows all future things, all things to come. The differences of time cannot hinder a
knowledge of all things by him, who is before time, above time, that is not measured by hours, or days, or
years; if God did not know them, the hindrance must be in himself, or in the things themselves, because
they are things to come: not in himself; if it did, it must arise from some impotency in his own nature, and
so we render him weak; or from an unwillingness to know, and so we render him lazy, and an enemy to
his own perfection; for, simply considered, the knowledge of more things is a greater perfection than the
knowledge of a few; and if the knowledge of a thing includes something of perfection, the ignorance of a
thing includes something of imperfection. The knowledge of future things is a greater perfection than not
to know them, and is accounted among men a great part of wisdom, which they call foresight; it is then
surely a greater perfection in God to know future things, than to be ignorant of them. And would God
rather have something of imperfection than be possessor of all perfection? Nor doth the hindrance lie in
the things themselves, because their futurition depends upon his will; for as nothing can actually be
without his will, giving it existence, so nothing can be future without his will, designing the futurity of it.
Certainly if God knows all things possible, which he will not do, he must know all things future, which he
is not only able, but resolved to do, or resolved to permit. God’s perfect knowledge of himself, that is, of
his own infinite power and concluding will, necessarily includes a foreknowledge of what he is able to do,
and what he will do. Again, if God doth not know future things, there was a time when God was ignorant
of most things in the world; for before the deluge he was more ignorant than after; the more things were
done in the world, the more knowledge did accrue to God, and so the more perfection; then the
understanding of God was not perfect from eternity, but in time; nay, is not perfect yet, if he be ignorant
of those things which are still to come to pass; he must tarry for a perfection he wants, till those futurities
come to be in act, till those things which are to come, cease to be future, and begin to be present. Either
God knows them, or desires to know them; if he desires to know them and doth not, there is something
wanting to him; all desire speaks an absence of the object desired, and a sentiment of want in the person
desiring: if he doth not desire to know them, nay, if he doth not actually know them, it destroys all
providence, all his government of affairs; for his providence hath a concatenation of means with a
prospect of something that is future: as in Joseph’s case, who was put into the pit, and sold to the
Egyptians in order to his future advancement, and the preservation both of his father and his envious
brethren. If God did not know all the future inclinations and actions of men, something might have been
done by the will of Potiphar, or by the free-will of Pharoah, whereby Joseph might have been cut short of
his advancement, and so God have been interrupted in the track and method of his designed providences.
He that hath decreed to govern man for that end he hath designed him, knows all the means before,
whereby he will govern him, and therefore hath a distinct and certain knowledge of all things; for a
confused knowledge is an imperfection in government; it is in this the infiniteness of his understanding is
more seen than in knowing things past or present; his eyes are a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14), in regard of the
penetrating virtue of them into things impenetrable by any else. To make it further appear that God knows
all things future, consider,
</p>
<p>
     1. Everything which is the object of God’s knowledge without himself was once only future. There
was a moment when nothing was in being but himself: he knew nothing actually past, because nothing
was past; nothing actually present, because nothing had any existence but himself; therefore only what
was future. And why not everything that is future now, as well as only what was future and to come to
pass just at the beginning of the creation? God indeed knows everything as present, but the things
themselves known by him were not present, but future; the whole creation was once future, or else it was
from eternity; if it begun in time, it was once future in itself, else it could never have begun to be. Did not
God know what would be created by him, before it was created by him?693 Did he create he knew not
what, and knew not before, what he should create? Was he ignorant before he acted, and in his acting,
what his operation would tend to? or did he not know the nature of things, and the ends of them, till he
had produced them and saw them in being? Creatures, then, did not arise from his knowledge, but his
knowledge from them; he did not then will that his creatures should be, for he had then willed what he
knew not, and knew not what he willed; they, therefore, must be known before they were made, and not
known because they were made; he knew them to make them, and he did not make them to know them;
By the same reason that he knew what creatures should be before they were, he knows still what creatures
shall be before they are;694 for all things that are, were in God, not really in their own nature, but in him as
a cause; so the earth and heavens were in him, as a model is in the mind of a workman, which is in his
mind and soul, before it be brought forth into outward act.
</p>
<p>
    2. The predictions of future things evidence this. There is not a prophecy of any thing to come, but is a
spark of his foreknowledge, and bears witness to the truth of this assertion, in the punctual
accomplishment of it; this is a thing challenged by God as his own peculiar, wherein he surmounts all the
idols that man’s inventions have godded in the world (Isa. 41:21, 22): Let them bring them forth
(speaking of the idols) and show us what shall happen, or declare us things to come: show the things that
are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods. Such a fore-knowledge of things to come, is
here ascribed to God by God himself, as a distinction of him from all false gods; such a knowledge, that if
any could prove that they were possessors of, he would acknowledge them gods as well as himself: “that
we may know that you are gods.” He puts his Deity to stand or fall apon this account, and this should be
the point which should decide the controversy, whether he or the heathen idols were the true God; the
dispute is managed by this medium,—He that knows things to come, is God; I know things to come, ergo,
I am God; the idols know not things to come, therefore they are not gods; God submits the being of his
Deity to this trial. If God know things to come no more than the heathen idols, which were either devils or
men, he would be, in his own account, no more a God than devils or men, no more a God than the pagan
idols he doth scoff at for this defect. If the heathen idols were to be stripped of their deity for want of this
foreknowledge of things to come, would not the true God also fall from the same excellency if he were.
defective in knowledge? He would, in his own judgment, no more deserve the title and character of a God
than they. How could he reproach them for that, if it were wanting in himself? It cannot be understood of
future things in their causes, when the effects necessarily arise from such causes, as light from the sun,
and heat from the fire many of these men know; more of them angels and devils know if God, therefore,
had not a higher and farther knowledge than this, he would not by this be proved to be God any more than
angels and devils, who know necessary effects in their causes. The devils, indeed, did predict some things
in the heathen oracles; but God is differenced from them here by the infiniteness of his knowledge, in
being able to predict things to come that they knew not, or things in their particularities, things that
depended on the liberty of man’s will, which the devils could lay no claim to a certain knowledge of.
Were it only a conjectural knowledge that is here meant, the devils might answer, they can conjecture, and
so their deity was as good as God’s; for, though God might know more things, and conjecture nearer to
what would be, yet still it would be but conjectural, and therefore not a higher kind of knowledge than
what the devils might challenge. How much, then, is God beholden to the Socinians for denying the
knowledge of all future things to him, upon which here he puts the trial of his Deity? God asserts his
knowledge of things to come, as a manifest evidence of his Godhead; those that deny, therefore, the
argument that proves it, deny the conclusion too; for this will necessarily follow, that if he be God,
because he knows future things then he that doth not know future things is not God; and if God knows not
future things but only by conjecture, then there is no God, because a certain knowledge, so as infallibly to
predict things to come, is an inseparable perfection of the Deity: it was, therefore, well said of Austin, that
it was as high a madness to deny God to be, as to deny him the foreknowledge of things to come. The
whole prophetic part of Scripture declares this perfection of God; every prophet’s candle was lighted at
this torch; they could not have this foreknowledge of themselves; why might not many other men have the
same insight, if it were nature? It must be from some superior Agent; and all nations owned prophecy as a
beam from God, a fruit of Divine illumination.695 Prophecy must be totally expunged if this be denied; for
the subjects of prophecy are things future, and no man is properly a prophet but in prediction. Now
prediction is nothing but foretelling, and things foretold are not yet come, and the foretelling of them
supposeth them not to be yet, but that they shall be in time; several such predictions we have in Scripture,
the event whereof hath been certain. The years of famine in Egypt foretold that he would order second
causes for bringing that judgment upon them; the captivity of his people in Babylon, the calling of the
Gentiles, the rejection of the Jews. Daniel’s revelation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream; that prince refers to
God as the revealer of secrets (Dan. 2:47). By the same reason that he knows one thing future by himself,
and by the infiniteness of his knowledge before any causes of them appear, he doth know all things future.
</p>
<p>
     3. Some future things are known by men; and we must allow God a greater knowledge than any
creature. Future things in their causes may be known by angels and men, (as I said before); whosoever
knows necessary causes, and the efficacy of them, may foretell the effects; and when he sees the meeting
and concurrence of several causes together, he may presage what the consequent effect will be of such a
concurrence: so physicians foretel the progress of a disease, the increase or diminution of it by natural
signs; and astronomers foretel eclipses by their observation of the motion of heavenly bodies, many years
before they happen;696 can they be hid from God, with whom are the reasons of all things?697 An expert
gardener, by knowing the root in the depth of winter, can tell what flowers and what fruit it will bear, and
the month when they will peep out their heads; and shall not God much more, that knows the principles of
all his creatures, and is exactly privy to all their natures and qualities, know what they will be, and what
operations shall be from those principles? Now, if God did know things only in their causes, his
knowedge would not be more excellent than the knowledge of angels and men, though he might know
more than they of the things that will come to pass, from every cause singly, and from the concurrence of
many. Now, as God is more excellent in being than his creature, so he is more excellent in the objects of
his knowledge, and the manner of his knowledge; well, then, shall a certain knowledge of something
future, and a conjectural knowledge of many things, be found among men? and shall a determinate and
infallible knowledge of things to come be found nowhere, in no being? If the conjecture of future things
savours of ignorance, and God knows them only by conjecture, there is, then, no such thing in being as a
perfect intelligent Being, and so no God.
</p>
<p>
     4. God knows his own decree and will, and therefore must needs know all future things. If anything be
future, or to come to pass, it must be from itself or from God: not from itself, then it would be
independent and absolute: if it hath its futurity from God, then God must know what he hath decreed to
come to pass; those things that are future, in necessary causes, God must know, because he willed them to
be causes of such effects; he, therefore, knows them, because he knows what he willed. The knowledge of
God cannot arise from the things themselves, for then the knowledge of God would have a cause without
him; and knowledge, which is an eminent perfection, would be conferred upon him by his creatures. But
as God sees things possible in the glass of his own power, so he sees things future in the glass of his own
will; in his effecting will, if he hath decreed to produce them; in his permitting will, as he hath decreed to
suffer them and dispose of them; nothing can pass out of the rank of things merely possible into the order
of things future, before some act of God’s will hath passed for its futurition.698 It is not from the
infiniteness of his own nature, simply considered, that God knows things to be future;699 for as things are
not future because God is infinite (for then all possible things should be future), so neither is any thing
known to be future only because God is infinite, but because God hath decreed it; his declaration of things
to come, is founded upon his appointment of things to come.700 In Isaiah 44:7, it is said, “And who, as I,
shall call and declare it, since I appointed the ancient people, and the things that are coming?”701 Nothing
is created or ordered in the world but what God decreed to be created and ordered. God knows his own
decree, and therefore all things which he hath decreed to exist in time; not the minutest part of the world
could have existed without his will, not an action can be done without his will; as life, the principle, so
motion, the fruit of that life, is by and from God; as he decreed life to this or that thing, so he decreed
motion as the effect of life, and decreed to exert his power in concurring with them, for producing effects
natural from such causes; for without such a concourse they could not have acted anything, or produced
anything; and therefore as for natural things, which we call necessary causes, God foreseeing them all
particularly in his own decree, foresaw also all effects which must necessarily flow from them, because
such causes cannot but act when they are furnished with all things necessary for action: he knows his own
decrees, and therefore necessarily knows what he hath decreed, or else we must say things come to pass
whether God will or no, or that he wills he knows not what; but this cannot be, for “known unto God are
all his works, from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18). Now this necessarily, flows from that
principle first laid down, that God knows himself, since nothing is future without God’s will; if God did
not know future things, he would not know his own will; for as things possible could not be known by
him, unless he knew the fulness of his own power, so things future could not be known by his
understanding, unless he knew the resolves of his own will. Thus the knowledge of God differs from the
knowledge of men;702 God’s knowledge of his works precedes his works; man’s knowledge of God’s
works follows his works, just as an artificer’s knowledge of a watch, instrument, or engine, which he
would make, is before his making of it; he knows the motion of it, and the reason of those motions before
it is made, because he knows what he hath determined to work; he knows not those motions from the
consideration of them after they were made, as the spectator doth, who, by viewing the instrument after it
is made, gains a knowledge from the sight and the consideration of it, till he understands the reason of the
whole; so we know things from the consideration of them after we see them in being, and therefore we
know not future things: but God’s knowledge doth not arise from things because they are, but because he
wills them to be; and therefore he knows everything that shall be, because it cannot be without his will, as
the Creator and maintainer of all things; knowing his own substance,. he knows all his works.
</p>
<p>
     5. If God did not know all future things, he would be mutable in his knowledge. If he did not know all
things that ever were or are to be, there would be upon the appearance of every new object, an addition of
light to his understanding, and therefore such a change in him as every new knowledge causes in the mind
of a man, or as the sun works in the world upon its rising every morning, scattering the darkness that was
upon the face of the earth; if he did not know them before they came, he would gain a knowledge by them
when they came to pass, which he had not before they were effected; his knowledge would be new
according to the newness of the objects, and multiplied according to the multitude of the objects. If God
did know things to come as perfectly as he knew things present and past, but knew those certainly, and the
others doubtfully and conjecturally, he would suffer some change, and acquire some perfection in his
knowledge, when those future things should cease to be future, and become present; for he would know it
more perfectly when it were present, than he did when it was future, and so there would be a change from
imperfection to a perfection; but God is every way immutable. Besides, that perfection would not arise
from the nature of God, but from the existence and presence of the thing; but who will affirm that God
acquires any perfection of knowledge from his creatures, any more than he doth of being? he would not
then have that knowledge, and consequently that perfection from eternity, as he had when he created the
world, and will not have a full perfection of the knowledge of his creature till the end of the world, nor of
immortal souls, which will certainly act as well as live to eternity; and so God never was, nor ever will be,
perfect in knowledge; for when you have conceived millions of years, wherein angels and souls live and
act, there is still more coming than you can conceive, wherein they will act. And if God be always
changing to eternity, from ignorance to knowledge, as those acts come to be exerted by his creatures, he
will not be perfect in knowledge, no, not to eternity, but will always be changing from one degree of
knowledge to another; a very unworthy conceit to entertain of the most blessed, perfect, and infinite God!
Hence, then, it follows, that:
</p>
<p>
     (1.) God foreknows all his creatures. All kinds which he determined to make; all particulars that
should spring out of every species; the time when they should come forth of the womb; the manner how;
“In thy Book all my members were written” (Psalm 139:16). Members is not in the Heb. whence some
refer all, to all living creatures whatsoever, and all the parts of them which God did foresee; he knew the
number of creatures with all their parts; they were written in the book of his foreknowledge; the duration
of them, how long they shall remain in being, and act upon the stage; he knows their strength, the links of
one cause with another, and what will follow in all their circumstances, and the series and combinations
of effects with their causes. The duration of everything is foreknown, because determined (Job 14:5);
“seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds,
that he cannot pass;” bounds are fixed, beyond which none shall reach; he speaks of days and months, not
of years, to give us notice of God’s particular foreknowledge of everything, of every day, month, year,
hour of a man’s life.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) All the acts of his creatures are foreknown by him. All natural acts, because he knows their
causes; voluntary acts I shall speak of afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) This foreknowledge was certain. For it is an unworthy notion of God to ascribe to him a
conjectural knowledge; if there were only a conjectural knowledge, he could but conjecturally foretel
anything; and then it is possible the events of things might be contrary to his predictions. It would appear
then that God were deceived and mistaken, and then there could be no rule of trying things, whether there
were from God or no; for the rule God sets down to discern his words from the words of false prophets, is
the event and certain accomplishment of what is predicted (Deut. 18:21) to that question, “How shall we
know whether God hath spoken or no?” he answers, that “if the thing doth not come to pass, the Lord hath
not spoken.” If his knowledge of future things were not certain, there were no stability in this rule, it
would fall to the ground: we never yet find God deceived in any prediction, but the event did answer his
forerevelation; his foreknowledge, therefore, is certain and infallible. We cannot make God uncertain in
his knowledge, but we must conceive him fluctuating and wavering in his will; but if his will be not yea
and nay, but yea, his knowledge is certain, because he doth certainly will and resolve.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) This foreknowledge was from eternity. Seeing he knows things possible in his power, and things
future in his will; if his power and resolves were from eternity, his knowledge must be so too, or else we
must make him ignorant of his own power, and ignorant of his own will from eternity; and consequently
not from eternity blessed and perfect. His knowledge of possible things must run parallel with his power,
and his knowledge of future things run parallel with his will. If he willed from eternity, he knew from
eternity what he willed; but that he did will from eternity, we must grant, unless we would render him
changeable, and conceive him to be made in time of not willing, willing. The knowledge God hath in
time, was always one and the same, because his understanding is his proper essence, and of an immutable
nature.703 And indeed the actual existence of a thing is not simply necessary to its being perfectly known;
we may see a thing that is past out of being, when it doth actually exist; and a carpenter may know the
house he is to build, before it be built, by the model of it in his own mind; much more we may conceive
the same of God whose decrees were before the foundation of the world;704 and to be before time was, and
to be from eternity, hath no difference. As God in his being exceeds all beginning of time, so doth his
knowledge all motions of time.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) God foreknows all things as present with him from eternity. As he knows mutable things with an
immutable and firm knowledge, so he knows future things with a present knowledge;705 not that the things
which are produced in time, were actually and really present with him in their own beings from eternity;
for then they could not be produced in time; had they a real existence, then they would not be creatures,
but God; and had they actual being, then they could not be future, for future speaks a thing to come that is
not yet. If things had been actually present with him, and yet future, they had been made before they were
made, and had a being before they had a being; but they were all present to his knowledge as if they were
in actual being, because the reason of all things that were to be made, was present with him. The reason of
the will of God that they shall be, was aqually eternal with him, wherein he saw what, and when, and how
he would create things, how he would govern them, to what ends he would direct them.706 Thus all things
are present to God’s knowledge, though in their own nature they may be past or future, not in esse reali,
but in esse intelligibili, objectively, not actually present707 for as the unchangeableness and infiniteness of
God’s knowledge of changeable and finite things, doth not make the things he knows immutable and
infinite, so neither doth the eternity of his knowledge make them actually present with him from eternity;
but all things are present to his understanding, because he hath at once a view of all successions of times;
and his knowledge of future things is as perfect as of present things, or what is past; it is not a certain
knowledge of present things, and an uncertain knowledge of future, but his knowledge of one is as certain
and unerring as his knowledge of the other;708 as a man that beholds a circle with several lines from the
centre, beholds the lines as they are joined in the centre, beholds them also as they are distant and severed
from one another, beholds them in their extent and in their point all at once, though they may have a great
distance from one another. He saw from the beginning of time to the last minute of it, all things coming
out of their causes, marching in their order according to his own appointment; as a man may see a
multitude of ants, some creeping one way, some another, employed in several businesses for their winter
provision. The eye of God at once runs through the whole circle of time; as the eye of man upon a tower
sees all the passengers at once, though some be past, some under the tower, some coming at a farther
distance. “God,” saith Job, “looks to the end of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven” (Job 28:24);
the knowledge of God is expressed by sight in Scripture, and futurity to God is the same thing as distance
to us; we can with a perspective-glass make things that are afar off appear as if they were near; and the
sun, so many thousand miles distant from us, to appear as if it were at the end of the glass: why, then,
should future things be at so great a distance from God’s knowledge, when things so far from us may be
made to approach so near to us? God considers all things in his own simple knowledge, as if they were
now acted; and therefore some have chosen to call the knowledge of things to come, not prescience, or
foreknowledge, but knowledge; because God sees all things in one instant, scientià nunquam deficientis
instantiæ.709 Upon this account, things that are to come, are set down in Scripture as present, and
sometimes as past (Isa. 9:6): “Unto us a child is born,” though not yet born; so of the sufferings of Christ
(Isa. 53:4, &amp;c.): “He hath borne our griefs, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was taken from
prison,” &amp;c., not shall be; and (Psalm 22:18): “they part my garments among them,” as if it were present;
all to express the certainty of God’s foreknowledge, as if things were actually present before him.
</p>
<p>
     (6.) This is proper to God, and incommunicable to any creature. Nothing but what is eternal can know
all things that are to come. Suppose a creature might know things that are to come, after he is in being, he
cannot know things simply as future, because there were things future before he was in being. The devils
know not men’s heart, therefore cannot foretel their actions with any certainty; they may indeed have a
knowledge of some things to come, but it is only conjectural, and often mistaken; as the devil was in his
predictions among the heathen, and in his presage of “Job’s cursing God to his face” upon his pressing
calamities (Job 1:11). Sometimes, indeed, they have a certain knowledge of something future by the
revelation of God, when he uses them as instruments of his vengeance, or for the trial of his people, as in
the case of Job, when he gave him a commission to strip him of his goods; or, as the angels have, when he
uses them as instruments of the deliverance of his people.
</p>
<p>
     (7.) Though this be certain, that God foreknows all things and actions, yet the manner of his knowing
all things before they come, is not so easily resolved. We must not, therefore, deny this perfection in God,
because we understand not the manner how he hath the knowledge of all things. It were unworthy for us
to own no more of God than we can perfectly conceive of him; we should then own no more of him than
that he doth exist. “Canst thou,” saith Job, “by searching, find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty
unto perfection?” (Job 11:7). Do we not see things unknown to inferior creatures, to be known to
ourselves? Irrational creatures do not apprehend the nature of a man, nor what we conceived of them
when we look upon them; nor do we know what they fancy of us when they look wistly upon us; for
ought as I know, we understand as little the manner of their imaginations, as they do of ours; and shall we
ascribe a darkness in God as to future things, because we are ignorant of them, and of the manner how he
should know them?710 shall we doubt whether God doth certainly know those things which we only
conjecture? As our power is not the measure of the power of God, so neither is our knowledge the judge
of the knowledge of God, no better nor so well as an irrational nature can be the judge of our reason. Do
we perfectly know the manner how we know? shall we therefore deny that we know anything? We know
we have such a faculty which we call understanding, but doth any man certainly know what it is? and
became he doth not, shall he deny that which is plain and evident to him? Because we cannot ascertain
ourselves of the causes of the ebbing and flowing of the sea, of the manner how minerals are engendered
in the earth, shall we therefore deny that which our eyes convince us of? And this will be a preparation to
the last thing.
</p>
<p>
     Fifthly, God knows all future contingencies, that is, God knows all things that shall accidentally
happen, or, as we say, by chance; and he knows all the free motions of men’s wills that shall be to the end
of the world. If all things be open to him (Heb. 4:13), then all contingencies are, for they are in the
number of things; and as, according to Christ’s speech, those things that are impossible to man, are
possible to God, so those things which are unknown to man, are known to God; because of the infinite
fulness and perfection of the divine understanding. Let us see what a contingent is. That is contingent
which we commonly call accidental, as when a tile falls suddenly upon a man’s head as he is walking in
the street; or when one letting off a musket at random shoots another he did not intend to hit; such was
that arrow whereby Ahab was killed, shot by a soldier at a venture (1 Kings 22:39); this some call a mixed
contingent, made up partly of necessity, and partly of accident; it is necessary the bullet, when sent out of
the gun, or arrow out of the bow, should fly and light somewhere; but it is an accident that it hits this or
that man, that was never intended by the archer. Other things, as voluntary actions, are purely contingents,
and have nothing of necessity in them; all free actions that depend upon the will of man, whether to do, or
not to do, are of this nature, because they depend not upon a necessary cause, as burning doth upon the
fire, moistening upon water, or as descent or falling down is necessary to a heavy body; for those cannot
in their own nature do otherwise; but the other actions depend upon a free agent, able to turn to this or that
point, and determine himself as he pleases. Now we must know, that what is accidental in regard of the
creature, is not so in regard of God; the manner of Ahab’s death was accidental, in regard of the hand by
which he was slain, but not in regard of God who foretold his death, and foreknew the shot, and directed
the arrow; God was not uncertain before of the manner of his fall, nor hovered over the battle to watch for
an opportunity to accomplish his own prediction; what may be or not be, in regard of us, is certain in
regard of God; to imagine that what is accidental to us, is so to God, is to measure God by our short line.
How many events following upon the results of princes in their counsels, seem to persons, ignorant of
those counsels, to be a haphazard, yet were not contingencies to the prince and his assistants, but foreseen
by him as certainly to issue so as they do, which they knew before would be the fruit of such causes and
instruments they would knit together! That may be necessary in regard of God’s foreknowledge, which is
merely accidental in regard of the natural disposition of the immediate causes which do actually produce
it; contingent in its own nature, and in regard of us, but fixed in the knowledge of God. One illustrates it
by this similitude;711 a master sends two servants to one and the same place, two several ways, unknown
to one another; they meet at the place which their master had appointed them; their meeting is accidental
to them, one knows not of the other, but it was foreseen by the master that they should so meet; and that
in regard of them it would seem a mere accident, till they came to explain the business to one another;
both the necessity of their meeting, in regard of their master’s order, and the accidentalness of it in regard
of themselves, were in both their circumstances foreknown by the master that employed them. For the
clearing of this, take it in this method.
</p>
<p>
     1. It is an unworthy conceit of God in any to exclude him from the knowledge of these things.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) It will be a strange contracting of him to allow him no greater a knowledge than we have
ourselves. Contingencies are known to us when they come into act, and pass from futurit to reality; and
when they are present to us, we can order our airs accordingly; shall we allow God no greater a measure
of knowledge than we have, and make him as blind as ourselves, not to see things of that nature before
they come to pass? Shall God know them no more? Shall we imagine God knows no otherwise than we
know? and that he doth, like us, stand gazing with admiration at events? man can conjecture many things;
is it fit to ascribe the same uncertainty to God, as though he, as well as we, could have no assurance till
the issue appear in the view of all? If God doth not certainly foreknow them, he doth but conjecture them;
but a conjectural knowledge is by no means to be fastened on God; for that is not knowledge, but guess,
and destroys a Deity by making him subject to mistake; for he that only guesseth, may guess wrong; so
that this is to make God like ourselves, and strip him of an universally acknowledged perfection of
omniscience. A conjectural knowledge, saith one,712 is as unworthy of God as the creature is unworthy of
omniscience. It is certain man hath a liberty to act many things this or that way as he pleases; to walk to
this or that quarter, to speak or not to speak; to do this or that thing, or not to do it; which way a man will
certainly determine himself, is unknown before to any creature, yea, often at the present to himself, for he
may be in suspense; but shall we imagine this future determination of himself is concealed from God?
Those that deny God’s foreknowledge in such cases, must either say, that God hath an opinion that a man
will resolve rather this way than that; but then if a man by his liberty determine himself contrary to the
opinion of God, is not God then deceived? and what rational creature can own him for a God that can be
deceived in anything? or else they must say that God is at uncertainty, and sustends his opinion without
determining it any way; then he cannot now free acts till they are done; he would then depend upon the
creature for his information; his knowledge would be every instant increased, as things, he knew not
before, came into act; and since there are every minute an innumerable multitude of various imaginations
in the minds of men, there would be every minute an accession of new knowledge to God which he had
not before; besides, this knowledge would be mutable according to the wavering and weathercock
resolutions of men, one while standing to this point, another while to that, if he depended upon the
creature’s determination for his knowledge.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) If the free acts of men were unknown before to God, no man can see how there can be any
government of the world by him. Such contingencies may happen, and such resolves of men’s free-wills
unknown to God, as may perplex his affairs, and put him upon new counsels and methods for attaining
those ends which he settled at the first creation of things; if things happen which God knows not of
before, this must be the consequence; where there is no foresight, there is no providence; things may
happen so sudden, if God be ignorant of them, that they may give a check to his intentions and scheme of
government, and put him upon changing the whole model of it. How often doth a small intervening
circumstance, unforeseen by man, dash in pieces a long meditated and well-formed design! To govern
necessary causes, as sun and stars, whose effects are natural and constant in themselves, is easy to be
imagined; but how to govern the world that consists of so many men of free-will, able to determine
themselves to this or that, and which have no constancy in themselves, as the sun and stars have, cannot
be imagined; unless we will allow in God as great a certainty of foreknowledge of the designs and actions
of men, as there is inconstancy in their resolves. God must be altering the methods of his government
every day, every hour, every minute, according to the determinations of men, which are so various and
changeable in the whole compass of the world in the space of one minute; he must wait to see what the
counsels of men will be, before he could settle his own methods of government; and so must govern the
world according to their mutability, and not according to any certainty in himself. But his counsel is stable
in the midst of multitudes of free devices in the heart of man (Prov. 19:21), and knowing them all before,
orders them to be subservient to his own stable counsel. If he cannot know what to-morrow will bring
forth in the mind of a man, how can he certainly settle his own determination of governing him? His
decrees and resolves must be temporal, and arise pro re nata, and he must alway be in counsel what he
should do upon every change of men’s minds. This is an unworthy conceit of the infinite majesty of
heaven, to make his government depend upon the resolves of men, rather than their resolves upon the
design of God.
</p>
<p>
    2. It is therefore certain, that God doth foreknow the free and voluntary acts of man. How could he
else order his people to ask of him things to come, in order to their deliverance, such things as depended
upon the will of man, if he foreknew not the motions of their will (Isa. 45:11)?
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Actions good or indifferent depending upon the liberty of man’s will as much as any whatsoever.
Several of these he hath foretold; not only a person to build up Jerusalem was predicted by him, but the
name of that person, Cyrus (Isa. 44:28). What is more contingent, or is more the effect of the liberty of
man’s will, than the names of their children? Was not the destruction of the Babylonish empire foretold,
which Cyrus undertook, not by any compulsion, but by a free inclination and resolve of his own will?
And was not the dismission of the Jews into their own country a voluntary act in that conqueror? If you
consider the liberty of man’s will, might not Cyrus as well have continued their yoke, as have struck off
their chains, and kept them captive, as well as dismissed them? Had it not been for his own interest, rather
to have strengthened the fetters of so turbulent a people, who being tenacious of their religion and laws
different from that professed by the whole world, were like to make disturbances more when they were
linked in a body in their own country, than when they were transplanted and scattered into the several
parts of his empire? It was in the power of Cyrus (take him as a man) to choose one or the other; his
interest invited him to continue their captivity, rather than grant their deliverance; yet God knew that he
would willingly do this rather than the other; he knew this which depended upon the will of Cyrus; and
why may not an infinite God foreknow the free acts of all men, as well as of one? If the liberty of Cyrus’
will was no hindrance to God’s certain and infallible foreknowledge of it, how can the contingency of any
other thing be a hindrance to him? for there is the same reason of one and all; and his government extends
to every village, every family, every person, as well as to kingdoms and nations. So God foretold, by his
prophet, not only the destruction of Jeroboam’s altar, but the name of the person that should be the
instrument of it (1 Kings 13:2), and this about 300 years before Josiah’s birth. It is a wonder that none of
the pious kings of Judah, in detestation of idolatry, and hopes to recover again the kingdom of Israel, had
in all that space named one of their sons by that name of Josiah, in hopes that that prophecy should be
accomplished by him; that Manasseh only should do this, who was the greatest imitator of Jeroboam’s
idolatry among all the Jewish kings, and indeed went beyond them; and had no mind to destroy in another
kingdom what he propagated in his own. What is freer than the imposition of a name? yet this he
foreknew, and this Josiah was Manasseh’s son (2 Kings 21:26). Was there anything more voluntary than
for Pharaoh to honor the butler by restoring him to his place, and punish the baker by hanging him on a
gibbet? yet this was foretold (Gen. 40:8). And were not all the voluntary acts of men, which were the
means of Joseph’s advancement, foreknown by God, as well as his exaltation, which was the end he
aimed at by those means? Many of these may be reckoned up. Can all the free acts of man surmount the
infinite capacity of the Divine understanding? If God singles out one voluntary action in man as
contingent as any, and lying among a vast number of other designs and resolutions, both antecedent and
subsequent, why should he not know the whole mass of men’s thoughts and actions, and pierce into all
that the liberty of man’s will can effect? why should he not know every grain, as well as one that lies in
the midst of many of the same kind? And since the Scripture gives so large an account of contingents,
predicted by God, no man can certainly prove that anything is unforeknown to him. It is as reasonable to
think he knows every contingent, as that he knows some that he as much hid from the eye of any creature,
since there is no more difficulty to an infinite understanding to know all, than to know some.713 Indeed, if
we deny God’s foreknowledge of the voluntary actions of men, we must strike ourselves off from the
belief of scripture predictions that yet remain unaccomplished, and will be brought about by the voluntary
engagements of men, as the ruin of antichrist, &amp;c. If God foreknows not the secret motions of man’s will,
how can he foretel them? if we strip him of this perfection of prescience, why should we believe a word
of scripture predictions? all the credit of the word of God is torn up by the roots. If God were uncertain of
such events, how can we reconcile God’s declaration of them to his truth; and his demanding our belief of
them to his goodness? Were it good and righteous in God to urge us to the belief of that he were uncertain
of himself, how could he be true in predicting things he were not sure of? or good, in requiring credit to
be given to that which might be false? This would necessarily follow, if God did not foreknow the
motions of men’s wills, whereby many of his predictions were fulfilled, and some remain yet to be
accomplished.

    (2.) God foreknows the voluntary sinful motions of men’s wills. First, God had foretold several of
them. Were not all the minute sinful circumstances about the death of our blessed Redeemer, as the
piercing him, giving him gall to drink, foretold, as well as the not breaking his bones, and parting his
garments? What were those but the free actions of men, which they did willingly without any constraint?
and those foretold by David, Isaiah, and other prophets; some above a thousand, some eight hundred, and
some more, some fewer years before they came to pass; and the events punctually answered the
prophesies. Many sinful acts of men, which depended upon their free will, have been foretold. The
Egyptians’ voluntary oppressing Israel (Gen. 15:13); Pharaoh’s hardening his heart against the voice of
Moses (Exod. 3:19); that Isaiah’s message would be in vain to the people (Isa. 6:9); that the Israelites
would be rebellious after Moses’ death, and turn idolaters (Deut. 31:16); Judas’ betraying of our Saviour,
a voluntary action (John 6. ult.); he was not force to do what he did, for he had some kind of repentance
for it; and not violence, but voluntariness falls under repentance. Second, His truth had depended upon
this foresight. Let us consider that in Gen. 15:16, “But in the fourth generation they shall come hither
again;” that is, the posterity of Abraham shall come into Canaan, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not
yet full.714 God makes a promise to Abraham, of giving his posterity the land of Canaan, not presently,
but in the fourth generation; if the truth of God be infallible in the performance of his promise, his
understanding is as infallible in the foresight of the Amorites’ sin; the fullness of their iniquity was to
precede the Israelites’ possession. Did the truth of God depend upon an uncertainty? did he make the
promise hand over head (as we say)? How could he, with any wisdom and truth, assure Israel of the
possession of the land in the fourth generation, if he had not been sure that the Amorites would fill up the
measure of their iniquities by that time? If Abraham had been a Socinian, to deny God’s knowledge of the
free acts of men, had he not a fine excuse for unbelief? What would his reply have been to God? Alas,
Lord, this is not a promise to be relied upon, the Amorites’ iniquity depends upon the acts of their free
will, and such thou canst have no knowledge of; thou canst see no more than a likelihood of their iniquity
being full, and therefore there is but a likelihood of thy performing thy promise, and not a certainty!
Would not this be judged not only, a saucy, but a blasphemous answer? And apon these principles the
truth of the most faithful God had been dashed to uncertainty and a peradventure. Third, God provided a
remedy for man’s sin, and therefore foresaw the entrance of it into the world by the fall of Adam. He had
a decree before the foundation of the world, to manifest his wisdom in the gospel by Jesus Christ, an
“eternal purpose in Jesus Christ” (Eph. 3:11), and a decree of election past before the foundation of the
world;—a separation of some to redemption, and forgiveness of sin in the blood of Christ, in whom they
were from eternity chosen, as well as in time accepted in Christ (Eph. 1:4, 6, 7), which is called a
“purpose in himself” (ver. 9); had not sin entered, there had been no occasion for the eath of the Son of
God, it being everywhere in Scripture laid upon that score;—a decree for the shedding of blood, supposed
a decree for the permission of sin, and a certain foreknowledge of God, that it would be committed by
man. An uncertainty of foreknowledge, and a fixedness of purpose, are not consistent in a wise man,
much less in the only wise God. God’s purpose to manifest his wisdom to men and angels in this way
might have been defeated, had God had only a conjectural foreknowledge of the fall of man; and all those
solemn purposes of displaying his perfections in those methods had been to no purpose;715 the provision
of a remedy supposed a certainty of the disease. If a sparrow fall not to the ground without the will of
God, how much less could such a deplorable ruin fall upon mankind, without God’s will permitting it, and
his knowledge foreseeing it? It is not hard to conceive how God might foreknow it?716 he indeed decreed
to create man in an excellent state; the goodness of God could not but furnish him with a power to stand;
yet in his wisdom he might foresee that the devil would be envious to man’s happiness, and would, out of
envy, attempt his subversion. As God knew of what temper the faculties were he had endued man with,
and how far they were able to endure the assaults of a temptation, so he also foreknew the grand subtelties
of Satan, how he would lay his mine, and to what point he would drive his temptation; how he would
propose and manage it, and direct his battery against the sensitive appetite, and assault the weakest part of
the fort; might he not foresee that the efficacy of the temptation would exceed the measure of the
resistance; cannot God know how far the malice of Satan would extend, what shots he would, according
to his nature, use, how high he would charge his temptation without his powerful restraint, as well as an
engineer judge how many shots of a cannon will make a breach in a town, and how many casks of powder
will blow up a fortress, who never yet built the one, nor founded the other? We may easily conclude God
could not be deceived in the judgment of the issue and event, since he knew how far he would let Satan
loose, how far he would permit man to act; and since he dives to the bottom of the nature of all things, he
foresaw that Adam was endued with an ability to stand; as he foresaw that Benhadad might naturally
recover of his disease; but he foresaw also that Adam would sink under the allurements of the temptation,
as he foresaw that Hamel would let Benhadad live (2 Kings 8:10). Now since the whole race of mankind
lies in corruption, and is subject to the power of the devil (1 John 3:18), may not God, that knows that
corruption in every man’s nature, and the force of every man’s spirit, and what every particular nature
will incline him to upon such objects proposed to him, and what the reasons of the temptation will be,
know also the issues? is there any difficulty in God’s foreknowing this, since man knowing the nature of
one he is well acquainted with, can conclude what sentiments he will have, and how he will behave
himself upon presenting this or that object to him? If a man that understands the disposition of his child or
servant, knows before what he will do upon such an occasion, may not God much more, who knows the
inclinations of all his creatures, and from eternity run with his eyes over all the works he intended? Our
wills are in the number of causes; and since God knows our wills, as causes, better than we do ourselves,
why should he be ignorant of the effects? God determines to give grace to such a man, not to give it to
another, but leave him to himself, and suffer such temptations to assault him; now God knowing the
corruption of man in the whole mass, and in every part of it, is it not easy for him to foreknow what the
future actions of the will will be, when the tinder and fire meet together, and how such a man will
determine himself, both us to the substance and manner of the action? Is it not easy for him to know how
a corrupted temper and a temptation will suit? God is exactly privy to all the gall in the hearts of men, and
what principles they will have, before they have a being. He “knows their thoughts afar off” (Psalm
139:2), as far off as eternity, as some explain the words, and thoughts are as voluntary as anything; he
knows the power and inclinations of men in the order of second causes; he understands the corruption of
men, as well as “the poison of dragons, and the venom of asps;” this is “laid up in store with him, and
sealed among his treasures” (Deut. 32:33, 34): among the treasures of his foreknowledge, say some. What
was the cruelty of Hazael, but a free act? yet God knew the frame of his heart, and what acts of murder
and oppression would spring from that bitter fountain, before Hazael had conceived them in himself (2
Kings 8:12), as a man that knows the minerals through which the waters pass, may know what relish they
will have before they appear above the earth, so our Saviour knew how Peter would deny him; he knew
what quantity of powder would serve for such a battery, in what measure he would let loose Satan, how
far he would leave the reins in Peter’s hands, and then the issue might easily be known; and so in every
act of man, God knows in his own will what measure of grace he will give, to determine the will to good,
and what measure of grace he will withdraw from such a person, or not give to him; and, consequently,
how far such a person will fall or not. God knows the inclinations of the creature; he knows his own
permissions, what degrees of grace he will either allow him, or keep from him, according to which will be
the degree of his sin. This may in some measure help our conceptions in this, though, as was said before,
the manner of God’s foreknowledge is not so easily explicable.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) God’s foreknowledge of man’s voluntary actions doth not necessitate the will of man. The
foreknowledge of God is not deceived, nor the liberty of man’s will diminished. I shall not trouble you
with any school distinctions, but be as plain as I can, laying down several propositions in this case.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. I. It is certain all necessity doth not take away liberty, indeed a compulsive necessity takes away
liberty, but a necessity of immutability removes not liberty from God; why should, then, a necessily of
infallibility in God remove liberty from the creature? God did necessarily create the world, because he
decreed it; yet freely, because his will from eternity stood to it, he freely decree it and freely created it, as
the apostle saith in regard of God’s decrees, “Who hath been his counsellor” (Rom. 11:34)? so in regard
of his actions I may say, Who hath been his compeller? he freely decreed, and he freely created. Jesus
Christ necessarily took our flesh, because he had covenanted with God so to do, yet he acted freely and
voluntarily according to that covenant, otherwise his death had not been efficacious for us. A good man
doth naturally, necessarily, love his children, yet voluntarily: it is part of the happiness of the blessed to
love God unchangeably, yet freely, for it would not be their happiness if it were done by compulsion.
What is done by force cannot be called felicity, because there is no delight or complacency in it; and,
though the blessed love God freely, yet, if there were a possibility of change, it would not be their
happiness, their blessedness would be damped by their fear of falling from this love, and consequently
from their nearness to God, in whom their happiness consists: God foreknows that they will love him
forever, but are they therefore compelled forever to love him? If there were such a kind of constraint,
heaven would be rendered burdensome to them, and so no heaven. Again, God’s foreknowledge of what
he will do, doth not necessitate him to do: he foreknew that he would create a world, yet he freely created
a world. God’s foreknowledge doth not necessitate himself; why should it necessitate us more than
himself? We may instance in ourselves: when we will a thing, we necessarily use our faculty of will; and
when we freely will any thing, it is necessary that we freely will; but this necessity doth not exclude, but
include, liberty; or, more plainly, when a man writes or speaks, whilst he writes or speaks, those actions
are necessary, because to speak and be silent, to write and not to write, at the same time, are impossible;
yet our writing or speaking doth not take away the power not to write or to be silent at that time if a man
would be so; for he might have chose whether he would have spoke or writ. So there is a necessity of such
actions of man, which God foresees; that is, a necessity of infallibility, because God cannot be deceived,
but not a coactive necessity, as if they were compelled by God to act thus or thus.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. II. No man can say in any of his voluntary actions that he ever found any force upon him. When
any of us have done anything according to our wills, can we say we could not have done the contrary to
it? were we determined to it in our own intrinsic nature, or did we not determine ourselves? did we not act
either according to our reason, or according to outward allurements? did we find anything without us, or
within us, that did force our wills to the embracing this or that? Whatever action you do, you do it because
you judge it fit to be done, or because you will do it. What, though God foresaw that you would do so,
and that you would do this or that, did you feel any force upon you? did you not act according to your
nature? God foresees that you will eat or walk at such a time; do you find anything that moves you to eat,
but your own appetite? or to walk, but your own reason and will? If prescience had imposed any necessity
upon man, should we not probably have found some kind of plea from it in the mouth of Adam? he knew
as much as any man ever since knew of the nature of God, as discoverable in creation; he could not in
innocence fancy an ignorant God, a God that know nothing of future things; he could not be so ignorant
of his own action, but he must have perceived a force upon his will, had there been any; had he thought
that God’s prescience imposed any necessity upon him, he would not have omitted the plea, especially
when he was so daring as to charge the providence of God in the gift of the woman to him, to be the cause
of his crime. (Gen. 3:12) How come his posterity to invent new charges against God, which their father
Adam never thought of, who had more knowledge than all of them? He could find no cause of his sin but
the liberty of his own will; he charges it, not upon any necessity from the devil, or any necessity from
God; nor doth he allege the gift of the woman as a necessary cause of his sin, but an occasion of it, by
giving the fruit to him. Judas knew that our Saviour did foreknow his treachery, for he had told him of it
in the hearing of his disciples (John 13:21–26), yet he never charged the necessity of his crime upon the
foreknowledge of his Master; if Judas had not done it freely, he had had no reason to repent of it; his
repentance justifies Christ from imposing any necessity upon him by that foreknowledge. No man acts
anything, but he can give an account of the motives of his action; he cannot father it upon a blind
necessity; the will cannot be compelled, for then it would cease to be the will: God doth not root up the
foundations of nature, or change the order of it, and make men unable to act like men, that is, as free
agents. God foreknows the actions of irrational creatures; this concludes no violence upon their nature, for
we find their actions to be according to their nature, and spontaneous.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. III. God’s foreknowledge is not, simply considered, the cause of anything. It puts nothing into
things, but only beholds them as present, and arising from their proper causes. The knowledge of God is
not the principle of things, or the cause of their existence, but directive of the action; nothing is because
God knows it, but because God wills it, either positively or permissively; God knows all things possible;
yet, because God knows them they are not brought into actual existence, but remain still only as things
possible; knowledge only apprehends a thing, but acts nothing; it is the rule of acting, but not the cause of
acting; the will is the immediate principle, and the power the immediate cause; to know a thing is not to
do a thing, for then we may be said to do everything that we know: but every man knows those things
which he never did, nor never will do; knowledge in itself is an apprehension of a thing, and is not. the
cause of it. A spectator of a thing is not the cause of that thing which he sees, that is, he is not the cause of
it, as he beholds it. We see a man write, we know before that he will write at such a time; but this
foreknowledge is not the cause of his writing. We see a man walk, but our vision of him brings no
necessity of walking upon him; he was free to walk or not to walk.717 We foreknow that death will seize
upon all men, we foreknow that the seasons of the year will succeed one another, yet is not our
foreknowledge the cause of this succession of spring after winter, or of the death of all men, or any man?
We see one man fighting with another; our sight is not the cause of that contest, but some quarrel among
themselves, exciting their own passions. As the knowledge of present things imposeth no necessity upon
them while they are acting, and present, so the knowledge of future things imposeth no necessity upon
them while the are coming. We are certain there will be men in the world to-morrow, and that the sea will
ebb and flow; but is this knowledge of ours the cause that those things will be so? I know that the sun will
rise to-morrow, it is true that it shall rise; but it is not true that my foreknowledge makes it to rise. If a
physician prognosticates, upon seeing the intemperances and debaucheries of men, that they will fall into
such a distemper, is his prognostication any cause of their disease, or of the sharpness of any symptoms
attending it? The prophet foretold the cruelty of Hazael before he committed it; but who will say that the
prophet was the cause of his commission of that evil? And thus the foreknowledge of God takes not away
the liberty of man’s will, no more than a foreknowledge that we have of any man’s actions takes away his
liberty. We may upon our knowledge of the temper of a man, certainly foreknow, that if he falls into such
company, and get among his cups; lie will be drunk; but is this foreknowledge the cause that he is drunk?
No; the cause is the liberty of his own will, and not resisting the temptation. God purposes to leave such a
man to himself and his own ways; and man being so left, God foreknows what will be done by him
according to that corrupt nature which is in him; though the decree of God of leaving a man to the liberty
of his own will be certain, yet the liberty of man’s will as thus left, is the cause of all the extravagances he
doth commit. Suppose Adam had stood, would not God certainly have foreseen that he would have stood?
yet it would have been concluded that Adam had stood, not by any necessity of God’s foreknowledge, but
by the liberty of his own will. Why should then the foreknowledge of God add more necessity to his
falling than to his standing? And though it be said sometimes in Scripture, that such a thing was done
“that the Scripture might be fulfilled,” as John 12:38, “that the saving of Esais might be fulfilled, Lord,
who hath believed our report?” the word that doth not infer that the prediction of the prophet was the
cause of the Jews’ belief, but infers this, that the prediction was manifested to be true by their unbelief,
and the event answered the prediction; this prediction was not the cause of their sin, but their foreseen sin
was the cause of this prediction; and so the particle that is taken (Psalm 51:6), “Against thee, thee only
have I sinned, that thou mightest be justified,” &amp;c.; the justifying God was not the end and intent of the
sin, but the event of it upon his acknowledgment.718
</p>
<p>
    Prop. IV. God foreknows things, because they will come to pass; but things are not future, because
God knows them. Foreknowledge presupposeth the object which is foreknown; a thing that is to come to
pass is the object of the Divine knowledge, but not the cause of the act of divine knowledge; and though
the foreknowledge of God doth in eternity precede the actual presence of a thing which is foreseen as
future, yet the future thing, in regard of its futurity, is as eternal as the foreknowledge of God: as the voice
is uttered before it be heard, and a thing is visible before it be seen, and a thing knowable before it be
known. But how comes it to be knowable to God? it must be answered, either in the power of God as a
thing possible, or in the will of God as a thing future; he first willed, and then knew what he willed; he
knew what he willed to effect, and he knew what he willed to permit; as he willed the death of Christ by a
determinate counsel, and willed the permission of the Jew’s sin, and the ordering of the malice of their
nature to that end (Acts 2:22). God decrees to make a rational creature, and to govern him by a law; God
decrees not to hinder this rational creature from transgressing his law; and God foresees that what he
would not hinder, would come to pass. Man did not sin because God foresaw him; but God foresaw him
to sin, because man would sin. If Adam and other men would have acted otherwise, God would have
foreknown that they would have acted well; God foresaw our actions because they would so come to pass
by the motion of our freewill, which he would permit, which he would concur with, which he would order
to his own holy and glorious ends, for the manifestation of the perfection of his nature. If I see a man lie
in a sink, no necessity is inferred upon him from my sight to lie in that filthy place, but there is a necessity
inferred by him that lies there, that I should see him in that condition if I pass by, and cast my eye that
way.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. V. God did not only foreknow our actions, but the manner of our actions. That is, he did not
only know that we would do such actions, but that we would do them freely; he foresaw that the will
would freely determine itself to this or that; the knowledge of God takes not away the nature of things;
though God knows possible things, yet they remain in the nature of possibility; and though God knows
contingent things, yet they remain in the nature of contingencies; and though God knows free agents, yet
they remain in the nature of liberty. God did not foreknow the actions of man, as necessary, but as free; so
that liberty is rather established by this foreknowledge, than removed. God did not foreknow that Adam
had not a power to stand, or that any man hath not a power to omit such a sinful action, but that he would
not omit it. Man hath a power to do otherwise than that which God foreknows he will do. Adam was not
determined by any inward necessity to fall, nor any man by any inward necessity to commit this or that
particular sin; but God foresaw that he would fall, and fall freely; for he saw the whole circle of means
and causes whereby such and such actions should be produced, and can be no more ignorant of the
motions of our wills, and the manner of them, than an artificer can be ignorant of the motions of his
watch, and how far the spring will let down the string in the space of an hour; he sees all causes leading to
such events in their whole order, and how the free-will of man will comply with this, or refuse that; he
changes not the manner of the creature’s operation, whatsoever it be.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. VI. But what if the foreknowledge of God, and the liberty of the will, cannot be fully reconciled
by man? shall we therefore deny a perfection in God to support a liberty in ourselves? Shall we rather
fasten ignorance upon God, and accuse him of blindness, to maintain our liberty? That God doth
foreknow everything, and yet that there is liberty in the rational creature, are both certain; but how fully to
reconcile them, may surmount the understanding of man. Some truths the disciples were not capable of
bearing in the days of Christ; and several truths our understandings cannot reach as long as the world doth
last; yet, in the mean time, we must, on the one hand, take heed of conceiving God ignorant, and on the
other hand, of imagining the creature necessitated; the one will render God imperfect, and the other will
seem to render him unjust, in punishing man for that sin which he could not avoid, but was brought into
by a fatal necessity. God is sufficient to render a reason of his own proceedings, and clear lip all at the day
of judgment; it is a part of man’s curiosity, since the fall, to be prying into God’s secrets, things too high
for him; whereby he singes his own wings, and confounds his own understanding. It is a cursed
affectation that runs in the blood of Adam’s posterity, to know as God, though our first father smarted and
ruined his posterity in that attempt; the ways and knowledge of God are as much above our thoughts and
conceptions as the heavens are above the earth (Isa. 55:9),719 and so sublime, that we cannot comprehend
them in their true and just greatness; his designs are so mysterious, and the ways of his conduct so
profound, that it is not possible to dive into them. The force of our understandings is below his infinite
wisdom, and therefore we should adore him with an humble astonishment, and cry out with the apostle
(Rom. 11:33): “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out!” Whenever we meet with depths that we cannot fathom, let us
remember that he is God, and we his creatures; and not be guilty of so great extravagance, as to think that
a subject can pierce into all the secrets of a prince, or a work understand all the operations of the artificer.
Let us only resolve not to fasten anything on God that is unworthy of the perfection of his nature, and
dishonorable to the glory of his majesty; nor imagine that we can ever step out of the rank of creatures to
the glory of the Deity, to understand fully everything in his nature. So much for the second general, what
God knows.
</p>
<p>
     III. The third is, how God knows all things. As it is necessary we should conceive God to be an
understanding being, else he could not be God, so we must conceive his understanding to be infinitely
more pure and perfect than ours in the act of it, else we liken him to ourselves, and debase him as low as
his footstool.720 As among creatures there are degrees of being and perfection, plants above earth and
sand, because they have a power of growth, beasts above plants, because to their power of growth there is
an addition of excellency of sense, rational creatures above beasts, because to sense there is added the
dignity of reason. The understanding of man is more noble than all the vegetative power of plants, or the
sensative power of beasts: God therefore must be infinitely more excellent in his understanding, and
therefore in the manner of it. As man differs from a beast in regard of his knowledge, so doth God also
from man, in regard of his knowledge. As God therefore is in being and perfection, infinitely more above
a man than a man is above a beast, the manner of his knowledge must be infinitely more above a man’s
knowledge, than the knowledge of a man is above that of a beast; our understanding can clasp an object in
a moment that is at a great distance from our sense; our eye, by one elevated motion, can view the
heavens; the manner of God’s understanding must be unconceivably above our glimmerings; as the
manner of his being is infinitely more perfect than all beings, so must the manner of his understanding be
infinitely more perfect than all created understandings,721 Indeed, the manner of God’s knowledge can no
more be known by us than his essence can be known by us; and the same incapacity in man, which
renders him unable to comprehend the being of God, renders him as unable to comprehend the manner of
God’s understanding. As there is a vast distance between the essence of God and our beings, so there is
between the thoughts of God and our thoughts; the heavens are not so much higher than the earth, as the
thoughts of God are above the thoughts of men, yea, and of the highest angel (Isa. 55:8, 9), yet though we
know not the manner of God’s knowledge, we know that he knows; as though we know not the
infiniteness of God, yet we know that he is infinite. It is God’s sole prerogative to know himself, what he
is; and it is equally his prerogative to know how he knows; the manner of Gods knowledge therefore must
be considered by us as free from those imperfections our knowledge is encumbered with. In general, God
doth necessarily know all things; he is necessarily omnipresent, because of the immensity of his essence;
so he is necessarily omniscient, because of the infiniteness of his understanding. It is no more at the
liberty of his will, whether he will know all things, than whether he will be able to create all things; it is
no more at the liberty of his will, whether he will be omniscient, than whether he will be holy; he can as
little be ignorant, as he can be impure; he knows not all things, because he will know them, but because it
is essential to his nature to know them. In particular,
</p>
<p>
     Prop. I. God knows by his own essence; that is, he sees the nature of things in the ideas of his own
mind, and the events of things in the decrees of his own will; he knows them not by viewing the things,
but by viewing himself; his own essence is the mirror and book, wherein he beholds all things that he doth
ordain, dispose and execute; and so he knows all things in their first and original cause; which is no other
than his own essence willing, and his own essence executing what he wills; he knows them in his power,
as the physical principle; in his will, as the moral principle of things, as some speak. He borrows not the
knowledge of creatures from the creatures, nor depends upon them for means of understanding, as we
poor worms do, who are beholden to the objects abroad to assist us with images of things, and to our
senses to convey them into our minds; God would then acquire a perfection from those things which are
below himself, and an excellency from those things which are vile; his knowledge would not precede the
being of the creatures, but the creatures would be before the act of his knowledge. If he understood by
images drawn from the creatures, as we do, there would be something in God which is not God, viz. the
images of things drawn from outward objects: God would then depend upon creatures for that which is
more noble than a bare being; for to be understanding, is more excellent than barely to be. Besides, if
God’s knowledge of his creatures were derived from the creatures by the impression of anything upon
him, as there is upon us, he could not know from eternity, because from eternity there was no actual
existence of anything but himself; and therefore there could not be any images shot out from anything,
because there was not anything in being but God; as there is no principle of being to anything. but by his
essence; so there is no principle of the knowledge of anything by himself but his essence; if the
knowledge of God were distinct from his essence, his knowledge were not eternal, because there is
nothing eternal but his essence. His understanding is not a faculty in him as it is in us, but the same with
his essence, because of the simplicity of his nature; God is not made up of various parts, one distinct from
another, as we are, and therefore doth not understand by a part of himself, but by himself; so that to be,
and to understand, is the same with God; his essence is not one thing, and the power whereby he
understands another; he would then be compounded, and not be the most simple being. This is also
necessary for the perfection of God; for the more perfect and noble the way and manner of knowing is, the
more perfect and noble is the knowledge. The perfection of knowledge depends upon the excellency of
the medium whereby we know. As a knowledge by reason, is a more noble way of knowing than
knowledge by sense; so it is more excellent for God to know by his essence, than by anything without
him, anything mixed with him; the first would render him dependent, and the other would demolish his
simplicity. Again, the natures of all things are contained in God, not formally; for then the nature of the
creatures would be God; but eminently, “He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye,
shall he not see?” (Psalm 94:9.) He hath in himself eminently the beauty, perfection, life and vigor of all
creatures; he created nothing contrary to himself, but everything with some footsteps of himself in them;
he could not have pronounced them good, as he did, had there been anything in them contrary to his own
goodness; and therefore as his essence primarily represents itself, so it represents the creatures, and makes
them known to him. As the essence of God is eminently all things, so by understanding his essence, he
eminently understands all things.722 And therefore he hath not one knowledge of himself, and another
knowledge of the creatures; but by knowing himself as the original and exemplary cause of all things, he
cannot be ignorant of any creature which he is the cause of; so that he knows all things, not by an
understanding of them, but by an understanding of himself; by understanding his own power as the
efficient of them, his own will as the orderer of them, his own goodness as the adorner and beautifier of
them, his own wisdom as the disposer of them, and his own holiness, to which many of their actions are
contrary. As he sees all things possible in his own power, because he is able to produce them; so he sees
all things future in his own will, decreeing to effect them, if they be good, or decreeing to permit them if
they be evil.723 In this class he sees what he will give being to, and what he will suffer to fall into a
deficiency, without looking out of himself, or borrowing knowledge from his creatures; he knows all
things in himself. And thus his knowledge is more noble, and of a higher elevation than ours, or the
knowledge of any creature can be; he knows all things by one comprehension of the causes in himself.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. II. God knows all things by one act of intuition. This the schools call an intuitive knowledge.
This follows upon the other; for if he know by his own essence, he knows all things by one act, there
would be otherwise a division in his essence, a first and a last, a nearness and a distance. As what he
made, he made by one word; so what he sees, he pierceth into by one glance from eternity to eternity: as
he wills all things by one act of his will, so he knows all things by one act of his understanding: he knows
not some things discursively from other things, nor knows one thing successively after another. As by one
act he imparts essence to things; so by one act he knows the nature of things.
</p>
<p>
    1. He doth not know by discourse, as we do;—that is, by deducing one thing from another, and from
common notions drawing out other rational conclusions and arguing one thing from another, and
springing up various consequences from some principle assented to. But God stands in no need of
reasonings; the making inferences and abstracting things, would be stains in the infinite perfection of
God; here would be a mixture of knowledge and ignorance; while he knew the principle, he would not
know the consequence and conclusion, till he had actually deduced it; one thing would be known after
another, and so he would have an ignorance, and then a knowledge; and there would be different
conceptions in God, and knowledge would be multiplied according to the multitude of objects; as it is in
human understandings. But God knows all things befcre they did exist, and never was ignorant of them
(Acts 15:18)
</p>
<p>
    “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” He therefore knows them all at
once; the knowledge of one thing was not before another, nor depended upon another, as it doth in the
way of human reasomng.724 Though, indeed, some make a virtual discourse in God; that is, though God
hath a simple knowledge, yet it doth virtually contain a discourse by the flowing of one knowledge from
another; as from the knowledge of his own power, he knows what things are possible to be made by him;
and from the knowledge of himself, he passes to the knowledge of the creatures; but this is only according
to our conception, and because of our weakness they are apprehended as two distinct acts in God, one of
which is the reason of another; as we say that one attribute is the reason of another; as his mercy may be
said to be the reason of his patience; and his omnipresence to be the reason of the knowledge of present
things done in the world. God, indeed, by one simple act, knows himself and the creatures; but when that
act whereby he knows himself, is conceived by us to pass to the knowledge of the creatures, we must not
understand it to be a new act, distinct from the other; but the same act upon different terms or objects;
such an order is in our understandings and conceptions, not in God’s.
</p>
<p>
    2. Nor doth he know successively as we do: that is, not by drops, one thing after another. This follows
from the former; a knowledge of all things without discourse, is a knowledge without succession.725 The
knowledge of one thing is not in God before another, one act of knowledge doth not beget another; in
regard of the objects, one thing is before another, one year before another, one generation of men before
another, one is the cause, the other is the effect; in the creatures there is such a succession, and God
knows there will be such a succession; but there is no such order in God’s knowledge, for he knows all
those successions by one glance, without any succession of knowledge in himself. Man, in his view of
things, must turn sometimes his body, sometimes only his eyes, he cannot see all the contents of a letter at
once; and though he beholds all the lines in the page of a book at once, and a whole country in a map, yet
to know what is contained in them, he must turn his eye from word to word, and line to line, and so spin
out one thing after another by several acts and motions. We behold a great part of the sea at once,726 but
not all the dimensions of it; for to know the length of the sea, we move our eyes one way; to see the
breadth of it, we turn our eyes another way; to behold the depth of it, we have another motion of them.
And when we cast our eyes up to heaven, we seem to receive in an instant, the whole extent of the
hemisphere; yet there is but one object the eye can attentively pitch upon, and we cannot distinctly view
what we see in a lump, without various motions of our eyes, which is not done without succession of
time.727 And certainly the understanding of angels is bounded, according to the measure of their beings;
so that it cannot extend itself at one time, to a quantity of objects, to make a distinct application of them,
but the objects must present themselves one by one; but God is all eye, all understanding; as there is no
succession in his essence, so there is none in his knowledge; his understanding in the nature and in the act,
is infinite, as it is in the text. He therefore sees, eternally and universally, all things by one act, without
any motion, much less various motions; the various changes of things, in their substance, qualities, places,
and relations, withdraw not anything from his eye, nor bring any new thing to his knowledge; he doth not
upon consideration of present things turn his mind from past; or when he beholds future things turn his
mind from present; but he sees them not one after another, but all at once and all together; the whole
circle of his own counsels, and all the various lines drawn forth from the centre of his will, to the
circumference of his creatures; just as if a man were able in one moment to read a whole library; or, as if
you should imagine a transparent crystal globe, hung up in the midst of a room, and so framed as to take
in the images of all things in the room, the fretwork in the ceiling, the inlaid parts of the floor and the
particular parts of the tapestry about it, the eye of a man would behold all the beauty of the room at once
in it. As the sun by one light and heat frames sensible things, so God by one simple act knows all things;
as he knows mutable things by an immutable knowledge, bodily things by a spiritual knowledge, so he
knows many things by one knowledge (Heb.4:13): “All things are open and naked to him,” more than any
one thing can be to us; and therefore he views all things at once, as well as we can behold and
contemplate one thing alone. As he is the Father of lights, a God of infinite understanding, there is no
variableness in his mind, nor any shadow of turning of his eye, as there is of ours, to behold various things
(James 1:17); his knowledge being eternal, includes all times; there is nothing past or future with him, and
therefore he beholds all things by one and the same manner of knowledge, and comprehends all knowable
things by one act, and in one moment. This must needs be so,
</p>
<p>
     (1.) Because of the eminency of God. God is above all, and therefore cannot but see the motions of all.
He that sits in a theatre, or at the top of a place, sees all things, all persons; by one aspect he comprehends
the whole circle of the place; whereas, he that sits below, when he looks before, he cannot see things
behind; God being above all, about all, in all, sees at once the motions of all. The whole world, in the eye
of God, is less than a point that divides one sentence from another in a book; as a cypher, a “grain of dust”
(Isa. 40:15); so little a thing can be seen by man at once; and all things being as little in the eye of God,
are seen at once by him. As all time is but a moment to his eternity, so all things are but as a point to the
immensity of his knowledge, which he can behold with more ease than we can move or turn our eye.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) Because all the perfections of knowing are united in God.728 As particular senses are divided in
man,—by one he sees, by another he smells, yet all those are united in one common sense, and this
common sense comprehends all,—so the various and distinct ways of knowledge in the creatures are all
eminently united in God. A man when he sees a grain of wheat, understands at once all things that can in
time proceed from that seed; so God, by beholding his own virtue and power, beholds all things which
shall in time be unfolded by him. We have a shadow of this way of knowledge in our own understanding;
the sense only perceives a thing present, and one object only proper and suitable to it; as the eye sees
color, the ear hears sounds; we see this and that man, one time this, another minute that; but the
understanding abstracts a notion of the common nature of man, and frames a conception of that nature
wherein all men agree; and so in a manner beholds and understands all men at once, by understanding the
common nature of man, which is a degree of knowledge above the sense and fancy; we may then
conceive an infinite vaster perfection in the understanding of God. As to know, is simply better than not
to know at all; so to know by one act comprehensive, is a greater perfection than to know by divided acts,
by succession to receive information, and to have an increase or decrease of knowledge; to be like a
bucket, always descending into the well, and fetching water from thence. It is a man’s weakness that he is
fixed on one object only at a time; it is God’s perfection that he can behold all at once, and is fixed upon
one no more than upon another.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. III. God knows all things independently. This is essential to an infinite understanding. He
receives not his knowledga from anything without him; he hath no tutor to instruct him, or book to inform
him: “Who hath been his counsellor?” saith the prophet (Isa. 40:13); he hath no need of the counsels of
others, nor of the instructions of others. This follows upon the first and second propositions; if he knows
things by his essence, then, as his essence is independent from the creatures, so is his knowledge; he
borrows not any images from the creature; hath no species or pictures of things in his understanding, as
we have; no beams from the creature strike apon him to enlighten him, but beams from him upon the
world; the earth sends not light to the sun, but the sun to the earth. Our knowledge, indeed, depends upon
the object, but all created objects depend upon God’s knowledge and will; we could not know creatures
unless they were; but creatures could not be unless God knew them. As nothing that he wills is the cause
of his will, so nothing that he knows is the cause of his knowledge; he did not make things to know them,
but he knows them to make them: who will imagine that the mark of the foot in the dust is the cause that
the foot stands in this or that particular place? If his knowledge did depend upon the things, then the
existence of things did precede God’s knowledge of them: to say that they are the cause of God’s
knowledge, is to say that God was not the cause of their being; and if he did create them, it was effected
by a blind and ignorant power; he created he knew not what, till he had produced it. If he be beholden for
his knowledge to the creatures he hath made, he had then no knowledge of them before he made them. If
his knowledge were dependent upon them, it could not be eternal, but must have a beginning when the
creatures had a beginning, and be of no longer a date than since the nature of things was in actual
existence; for whatsoever is a cause of knowledge, doth precede the knowledge it causes, either in order
of time, or order of nature: temporal things, therefore, cannot be the cause of that knowledge which is
eternal. His works could not be foreknown to him, if his knowledge commenced with the existence of his
works (Acts 15:18): if he knew them before he made them, he could not derive a knowledge from them
after they were made. He made all things in wisdom (Psalm 104:24). How can this be imagined, if the
things known where the cause of his knowledge, and so before his knowledge, and therefore before his
action.729 God would not then be the first in the order of knowing agents, because he would not act by
knowledge, but act before he knew, and know after he had acted; and so the creature which he made
would be before the act of his understanding, whereby he knew what he made. Again, since knowledge is
a perfection, if God’s knowledge of the creatures depended upon the creatures, he would derive an
excellency from them, they would derive no excellency from any idea in the Divine mind; he would not
be infinitely perfect in himself; if his perfection in knowledge were gained from anything without himself
and below himself; he would not be sufficient of himself, but be under an indigence, which wanted a
supply from the things he had made, and could not be eternally perfect till he had created and seen the
effects of his own power, goodness, and wisdom, to render him more wise and knowing in time than he
was from eternity. Who can fancy such a God as this without destroying the Deity he pretends to adore?
for if his understanding be perfected by something without him, why may not his essence be perfected by
something without him; that, as he was made knowing by something without him, he might be made God
by something without him? How could his understanding be infinite if it depended upon a finite object, as
upon a cause? Is the majesty of God to be debased to a mendicant condition, to seek for a supply from
things inferior to himself? Is it to be imagined that a fool, a toad, a fly, should be assistant to the
knowledge of God? that the most noble being should be perfected by things so vile; that the Supreme
Cause of all things should receive any addition of knowledge, and be determined in his understanding, by
the notion of things so mean? To conclude this particular, all things depend upon his knowledge, his
knowledge depends upon nothing, but is as independent as himself and his own essence.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. IV. God knows all things distinctly. His understanding is infinite in regard of clearness; “God is
light, and in him is no darkness at all” (John 1:5); he sees not through a mist or cloud; there is no blemish
in his understanding, no mote or beam in his eye, to render any thing obscure to him. Man discerns the
surface and outside of things; little or nothing of the essence of things; we see the noblest thing but “as in
a glass darkly” (1 Cor. 13:12); the too great nearness, as well as the too great distance of a thing, hinders
our sight; the smallness of a mote escapes our eye, and so our knowledge; also the weakness of our
understanding is troubled with the multitude of things, and cannot know many things but confusedly: but
God knows the forms and essence of things, every circumstance; nothing is so deep, but he sees to the
bottom; he sees the mass, and sees the motes of beings; his understanding being infinite, is not offended
with a multitude of things, or distracted with the variety of them; he discerns every thing infinitely more
clearly and perfectly than Adam or Solomon could any one thing in the circle of their knowledge; what
knowledge they had, was from him; he hath, therefore, infinitely a more perfect knowledge than they
were capable in their natures to receive a communication of. All things are open to him (Heb. 4:13); the
least fibre, in its nakedness and distinct frame, is transparent to him, as, by the help of glasses, the mouth,
feet, hands, of a small insect, are visible to a man, which seem to the eye, without that assistance, one
entire piece, not diversified into parts. All the causes, qualities, natures, properties of things, are open to
him; “he brings out the host of heaven by number, and calleth them by names” (Isa. 40:26); he numbers
the hairs of our heads: what more distinct than number? Thus God beholds things in every unity, which
makes up the heap; he knows, and none else can, every thing in its true and intimate causes, in its original
and intermediate causes; in himself, as the cause of every particular of their being, every property in their
being. Knowledge by the causes is the most noble and perfect knowledge, and most suited to the infinite
excellency of the Divine Being; he created all things, and ordered them to a universal and particular end;
he, therefore, knows the essential properties of every thing, every activity of their nature, all their fitness
for those distinct ends, to which he orders them, and for which he governs and disposeth them, and
understands their darkest and most hidden qualities infinitely clearer than any eye can behold the clear
beams of the sun. Ife knows all things as he made them; he made them distinctly, and therefore knows
them distinctly, and that every individual; therefore God is said (Gen. 1:31) to see every thing that he had
made; he took a review of every particular creature he had made, and upon his view pronounced it good.
To pronounce that good, which was not exactly known in every creek, in every mite of its nature, had not
consisted with his veracity; for every one that speaks truth ignorantly, that knows not that he speaks truth,
is a liar in speaking that which is true. God knows every act of his own will, whether it be positive or
permissive, and therefore every effect of his will. We must needs ascribe to God a perfect knowledge; but
a confused knowledge cannot challenge that title. To know things only in a heap is unworthy of the
Divine perfection; for if God knows his own ends in the creation of things, he knows distinctly the means
whereby he will bring them to those ends for which he hath appointed them: no wise man intends an end,
without a knowledge of the means conducing to that end; an ignorance, then, of any thing in the world,
which falls under the nature of a means to a Divine end (and there is nothing in the world but doth),
would be inconsistent with the perfection of God; it would ascribe to him a blind providence in the world.
As there can be nothing imperfect in his being and essence, so there can be nothing imperfect in his
understanding and knowledge, and therefore not a confused knowledge, which is an imperfection.
“Darkness and light are both alike to him” (Psalm 139:12); he sees distinctly into the one, as well as the
other; what is darkness to us, is not so to him.
</p>
<p>
     Prop. V. God knows all things infallibly. His understanding is infinite in regard of certainty; every
tittle of what he knows is as far from failing as what he speaks; our Saviour affirms the one (Matt. 5:18),
and there is the same reason of the certainty of one as well as the other; his essence is the measure of his
knowledge; whence it is as impossible that God should be mistaken in the knowledge of the lezst thing in
the world, as it is that he should be mistaken in his own essence; for, knowing himself comprehensively,
he must know all others things infallibly; since he is essentially omniscient, he is no more capable of error
in his understanding than of imperfection in his essence; his counsels are as unerring as his essence is
perfect, and his knowledge as infallible as his essence is free from defect. Again, since God knows all
things with a knowledge of vision, because he wills them, his knowledge must be as infallible as his
purpose; now his purpose will certainly be effected “what he hath thought shall come to pass, and what he
hath purposed shall stand” (Isa. 14:24); “his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure” (Isa.
46:10). There may be interruptions of nature, the foundation of it may be out of course, but there can be
no bar upon the Author of nature; he hath an infinite power to carry on and perfect the resolves of his own
will; he can effect what he pleases by a word. Speech is one of the least motions; yet when God said, “Let
there be light, there was light” arising from darkness. No reason can be given why God knows a thing to
be, but because he infallibly wills it to be. Again,730 the schools make this difference between the
knowledge of the good and bad angels, that the good are never deceived; for that is repugnant to their
blessed state; for deceit is an evil and an imperfection inconsistent with that perfect blessedness the good
angels are possessed of; and would it not much more be a stain upon the blessedness of that God, that is
blessed forever, to be subject to deceit? His knowledge therefore is not an opinion, for an opinion is
uncertain; a man knows not what to think, but leans to one part of the question proposed, rather than to
the other. If things did not come to pass therefore as God knows them, his knowledge would be imperfect;
and since he knows by his essence, his essence also would be imperfect, if God were exposed to any
deceit in his knowledge; he knows by himself, who is the highest truth; and therefore it is impossible he
should err in his understanding.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. VI. God knows immutably. His understanding else could not be infinite; everything and every
act that is mutable, is finite, it hath its bounds;for there is a term from which it changeth, and a term to
which it changes.731 There is a change in the understanding, when we gain the knowledge of a thing,
which was unknown to us before; or when we actually consider a thing which we did not know before,
though we had the principles of the knowledge of it; or, when we know that distinctly, which we before
knew confusedly. None of these can be ascribed to God without a manifest disparagement of his
infiniteness. Our knowledge indeed is alway arriving to us or flowing from us; we pass from one degree
to another; from worse to better, or from better to worse; but God loses nothing by the ages that are run,
nor will gain anything by the ages that are to come. If there were a variation in the knowledge of God, by
the daily and hourly changes in the world, he would grow wiser than he was, he was not then perfectly
wise before. A change in the objects known, infers not any change in the understanding exercised about
them;the wheel moves round, the spokes that are lowest are presently highest, and presently return to be
low again; but the eye that beholds them changes not with the motions of the wheels. God’s knowledge
admits no more of increase or decrease, than his essence doth; since God knows by his essence, and the
essence of God is God himself, his knowledge must be void of any change. The knowledge of possible
things, arising from the knowledge of his own power, cannot be changed unless his power be changed,
and God become weak and impotent; the knowledge of future things cannot be changed, because that
knowledge ariseth from his will, which is irreversible, “the counsel of the Lord that shall stand” (Prov.
19:21); so that if God can never decay into weakness, and never turn to inconstancy, there can be no
variation of his knowledge. He knows what he can do, and he knows what he will do; and both these
being immutable, his knowledge must, consequently, be so too: It was not necessary that this or that
creature should be, and therefore it was not necessary that God should know this or that creature with a
knowledge of vision; but after the will of God had determined the existence of this or that creature, his
knowledge being then determined to this or that object, did necessarily continue unchangeable. God,
therefore, knows no more now than he did before; and at the end of the world, he shall know no more than
he doth now; and from eternity, he knows no less than he doth now, and shall do to eternity. Though
things pass into being and out of being, the knowledge of God doth not vary with them,. for he knows
them as well before they were, as when they are, and knows them as well when they are past, as when
they are present.
</p>
<p>
    Prop. VII. God knows all things perpetually, i. e, in act. Since he knows by his essence, he always
knows, because his essence never ceaseth, but is a pure act; so that he doth not know only in habit, but in
act. Men that have the knowledge of some art or science, have it always in habit, though when they are
asleep they have it not in act: a musician hath the habit of music, but doth not so much as think of it when
his senses are bound up. But God is an unsleepy eye;732 he never slumbers nor sleeps; he never slumbers,
in regard of his providence, and therefore never slumbers in regard of his knowledge. He knows not
himself, nor any other creature more perfectly at one time than at another; he is perpetually in the act of
knowing, as the sun is in the act of shining; the sun never ceased to shine in one or other part of the world,
since it was first fixed in the heavens; nor God to be in the act of knowledge, since he was God; and
therefore since he always was, and always will be God, he always was and always will be in the act of
knowledge; always knowing his own essence, he must alway actually know what hath been gone and
ceased from being, and what shall come and arise into being; as a watchmaker knows what watch he
intends to make, and after he hath made it, though it be broken to pieces, or consumed by the fire, he still
knows it, because he knows the copy of it in his own mind. Some, therefore, in regard of this perpetual act
of the Divine knowledge, have called God not intellectus, but the intellection of intellections; we have no
proper English word to express the act of the understanding; as his power is co-eternal with him, so is his
knowledge; all times past, present, and to come, are embraced in the bosom of his understanding; he fixed
all things in their seasons, that nothing new comes to him, nothing old passes from him.733 What is done
in a thousand years, is actually present with his knowledge, as what is done in one day, or in one watch in
the night, is with ours; since a “thousand years are no more to God than a day,” or a “watch in the night”
is to us (Psalm 90:4). God is in the highest degree of being, and therefore in the highest degree of
understanding. Knowledge is one of the most perfect acts in any creature. God therefore hath all actual, as
well as essential and habitual knowledge; his understanding is infinite.
</p>
<p>
     IV. The fourth general is, Reasons to prove this.
</p>
<p>
     Reason 1. God must know what any creature knows, and more than any creature knows. There is
nothing done in the world but is known by some creature or other; every action is at least known by the
person that acts, and therefore known by the Creator, who cannot be exceeded by any of the creatures, or
all of them together; and every creature is known by him, since every creature is made by him.734 And as
God works all things by an infinite power, so he knows all things by an infinite understanding. First, the
perfection of God requires this.735 All perfections that include no essential defect, are formally in God; but
knowledge includes no essential defeet in itself, therefore it is in God. Knowledge in itself is desirable,
and an excellency; ignorance is a defect; it is impossible that the least grain of defect can be found in the
most perfect Being. Since God is wise, he must be knowing; for wisdom must have knowledge for the
basis of it. A creature can no more be wise without knowledge, than he can be active without strength.
Now God is “only wise” (Rom. 16:27); and, therefore, only knowing in the highest degree of knowledge,
incomprehensibly beyond all degrees of knowledge, because infinite. Again, the more spiritual anything
is, the more understanding it is. The dull body understands nothing; sense perceives, but the
understanding faculty is seated in the soul, which is of a spiritual nature, which knows things that are
present, remembers things that are past, foresees many things to come. What is the property of a spiritual
nature, must be, in a most eminent manner, in the supreme spirit of the world; that is, in the highest
degree of spirituality, and most remote from any matter. Again, nothing can enjoy other things, but by
some kind of understanding them; God hath the highest enjoyment of himself, of all things he hath
created, of all the glory that accrues to him by them; nothing of perfection and blessedness can be wanting
to him. Felicity doth not consist with ignorance, and all imperfect knowledge is a degree of ignorance:
God, therefore, doth perfectly know himself, and all things from whence he designs any glory to himself.
The most noble manner of acting must be ascribed to God, as being the most noble and excellent Being;
to act by knowledge is the most excellent manner of acting; God hath, therefore, not only knowledge, but
the most excellent manner of knowledge; for as it is better to know than to be ignorant, so it is better to
know in the most excellent manner, than to have a mean and low kind of knowledge; his knowledge,
therefore, must be every way as perfect as his essence, infinite as well as that. An infinite nature must
have an infinite knowledge: a God ignorant of anything cannot be counted infinite, for he is not infinite to
whom any degree of perfection is wanting.
</p>
<p>
     Reason 2. All the knowledge in any creature is from God. And you must allow God a greater and
more perfect knowledge than any creature hath, yea, than all creatures have. All the drops of
knowlhttp://acw.activate.net/fisher/KVI-AM.asxedge any creature hath, come from God; and all the
knowledge in every creature, that ever was, is, or shall be, in the whole mass, was derived from him. If all
those several drops in particular creatures, were collected into one spirit, into one creature, it would be an
unconceivable knowledge, yet still lower than what the Author of all that knowledge hath; for God cannot
give more knowledge than he hath himself; nor is the creature capable of receiving so much knowledge as
God hath. As the creature is incapable of receiving so much power as God hath, for then it would be
almighty, so it is incapable of receiving so much knowledge as God hath, for then it would be God.
Nothing can be made by God equal to him in anything; if anything could be made as knowing as God, it
would be eternal as God, it would be the cause of all things as God. The knowledge that we poor worms
have, is an argument God uses for the asserting the greatness of his own knowledge (Psalm 94:10): “He
that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?” Man hath here knowledge ascribed to him; the author of
this knowledge is God; he furnished him with it, and therefore doth in a higher manner possess it, and
much more than can fall under the comprehension of any creature; as the sun enlightens all things, but
hath more light in itself than it darts upon the earth or the heavens: and shall not God eminently contain
all that knowledge he imparts to the creatures, and infinitely more exact and comprehensive?
</p>
<p>
     Reason 3. The accusations of conscience evidence God’s knowledge of all actions of his creatures.
Doth not conscience check for the most secret sins, to which none are privy but a man’s self, the whole
world beside being ignorant of his crime? Do not the fears of another Judge gall the heart? If a judgment
above him be feared, an understanding above him. discerning their secrets is confessed by those fears;
whence can those horrors arise, if there be not a superior that understands and records the crime? What
perfection of the Divine Being can this relate unto, but omniscience? What other attribute is to be feared,
if God were defective in this? The condemnation of us by our own hearts, when none in the world can
condemn us, renders it legible, that there is One “greater than our hearts” in respect of knowledge, who
“knoweth all things” (1 John 3:20). Conscience would be a vain principle, and stingless without this; it
would be an easy matter to silence all its accusations, and mockingly laugh in the face of its severest
frowns. What need any trouble themselves, if none knows their crimes but themselves? Concealed sins,
gnawing the conscience, are arguments of God’s omniscience of all present and past actions.
</p>
<p>
     Reason 4. God is the first cause of everything, every creature is his production. Since all creatures,
from the highest angel to the lowest worm, exist by the power of God, if God understands his own power
and excellency, nothing can be hid from him, that was brought forth by that power, as well as nothing can
be unknown to him, that that power is able to produce. “If God knows nothing besides himself; he may
then believe there is nothing besides himself; we shall then fancy a God miserably mistaken: if he knows
nothing besides himself, then things were not created by him, or not understandingly and voluntarily
created, but dropped from him before he was aware.”736 To think that the First Cause of all should be
ignorant of those things he is the cause of, is to make him not a voluntary, but natural agent, and therefore
necessary; and then that the creature came from him as light from the sun, and moisture from the water;
this would be an absurd opinion of the world’s creation; if God be a voluntary agent, as he is, he must be
an intelligent agent. The faculty of will is not in any creature, without that of understanding also. If God
be an intelligent agent, his knowledge must extend as far as his operation, and every object of his
operation, unless we imagine God hath lost his memory, in that long tract of time since the first creation
of them. An artificer cannot be ignorant of his own work: if God knows himself, he knows himself to be a
cause; how can he know himself to be a cause, unless he know the effects he is the cause of? One relation
implies another; a man cannot know himself to be a father, unless he hath a child, because it is a name of
relation, and in the notion of it refers to another. The name of cause is a name of relation, and implies an
effect; if God therefore know himself in all his perfections, as the cause of things, he must know all his
acts, what his wisdom contrived, what his counsel determined, and what his power effected. The
knowledge of God is to be supposed in a free determination of himself; and that knowledge must be
perfect, both of the object, act, and all the circumstances of it. How can his will freely produce anything
that was not first known in his understanding? From this the prophet argues the understanding of God,
and the unsearchableness of it, because he is the “Creator of the ends of the earth” (Isa. 40:28), and the
same reason David gives of God’s knowledge of him, and of everything he did, and that afar off, because
he was formed by him (Psalm 139:2, 15, 16). As the perfect making of things only belongs to God: so
doth the perfect knowledge of things; it is as absurd to think, that God should be ignorant of what he hath
given being to; that he should not know all the creatures and their qualities, the plants and their virtues; as
that a man should not know the letters that are formed by him in writing. Everything bears in itself the
mark of God’s perfection; and shall not God know the representation of his own virtue?
</p>
<p>
    Reason 5. Without this knowledge, God could no more be the Governor, than he could be the Creator
of the world. Knowledge is the basis of providence; to know things, is before the government of things; a
practical knowledge cannot be without a theoretical knowledge. Nothing could be directed to its proper
end, without the knowledge of the nature of it, and its suitableness to answer that end for which it is
intended. As everything, even the minutest, falls under the conduct of God, so everything falls under the
knowledge of God. A blind coachman is not able to hold the reins of his horses, and direct them in right
paths: since the providence of God is about particulars, his knowledge must be about particulars; he could
not else govern them in particular; nor could all things be said to depend upon him in their being and
operations. Providence depends upon the knowledge of God, and the exercise of it upon the goodness of
God; it cannot be without understanding and will; understanding, to know what is convenient, and will to
perform it. When our Saviour therefore speaks of providence, he intimates these two in a special manner,
“Your heavenly Father knows that you have need of these things” (Matt. 6:32), and goodness, in Luke
11:13. The reason of providence is so joined with omniscience, that they cannot be separated. What a kind
of God would he be that were ignorant of those things that were governed by him! The ascribing this
perfection to him, asserts his providence; for it is as easy for one that knows all things, to look over the
whole world, if writ with monosyllables, in every little particular of it; as it is with a man to take a view of
one letter in an alphabet. Again, if God were not omniscient, how could he reward the good, and punish
the evil? the works of men are either rewardable or punishable; not only according to their outward
circumstances, but inward principles and ends, and the degrees of venom lurking in the heart.737 The exact
discerning of these, without a possibility to be deceived, is necessary to pass a right and infallible
judgment upon them, and proportion the censure and punishment to the crime: without such a knowledge
and discerning, men would not have their due; nay, a judgment just for the matter, would be unjust in the
manner, because unjustly past, without an understanding of the merit of the cause. It is necessary,
therefore that the Supreme Judge of the world should not be thought to be blindfold, when he distributes
his rewards and punishments, and muffle his face when he passes his sentence. It is necessary to ascribe to
him the knowledge of men’s thoughts and intentions; the secret wills and aims; the hidden works of
darkness in every man’s conscience, because every man’s work is to be measured by the will and inward
frame. It is necessary that he should perpetually retain all those things in the indelible and plain records of
his memory, that there may not be any work without a just proportion of what is due to it. This is the
glory of God, to discover the secrets of all hearts at last, as 1 Cor. 4:5, “The Lord shall bring to light the
hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of all hearts, and then shall every man
have praise of God.” This knowledge fits him to be a judge; the reason why the ungodly shall not stand in
judgment, is because God knows their ways, which is implied in his knowing the way of the righteous
(Psalm 1:5, 6). I now proceed to the use.

     Instruct 1. Jesus Christ is not a mere creature. The two titles of wonderful Counsellor, and mighty
God, are given him in conjunction (Isa. 9:6), not only the Angel of the covenant, as he is called (Mal.
3:1), or the executor of his counsels, but a counsellor, in conjunction with him in counsel as well as
power: this title is superior to any title given to any of the prophets in regard of their predictions; and
therefore I should take it rather as the note of his perfect understanding, than of his perfect teaching and
discovering; as Calvin doth. He is not only the revealer of what he knows, so were the prophets according
to their measures; but the counsellor of what he revealed, having a perfect understanding of all the
counsels of God, as being interested in them, as the mighty God. He calls himself by the peculiar title of
God, and declares that he will manifest himself by this prerogative to all the churches (Rev. 2:23): “And
all the churches shall know that I am he which scarches the reins and hearts,” the most hidden operations
of the minds of men, that lie locked up from the view of all the world besides. And this was no new thing
to Him, after his ascension; for the same perfection he had in the time of his earthly flesh (Luke 6:8), he
knew their thoughts; his eyes are therefore compared (Cant. 5:12) to doves’ eyes, which are clear and
quick; and to a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14), not only heat to consume his enemies, but light to discern their
contrivances against the church; he pierceth by his knowledge, into all parts, as fire pierceth into the
closest particle of iron, and separates between the most united parts of metals; and some tell us, he is
called a Roe, from the perspicacity of his sight, as well as from the swiftness of his motion.
</p>
<p>
     1. He hath a perfect knowledge of the Father; he knows the Father, and none else knows the Father;
angels know God, men know God, but Christ in a peculiar manner knows the Father; no man knows the
Son but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son (Matt. 11:27); he knows so, as that he
learns not from any other; he doth perfectly comprehend him, which is beyond the reach of any creature,
with the addition of all the divine virtue; not because of any incapacity in God to reveal, but the incapacity
of the creature to receive; finite is incapable of being made infinite, and therefore incapable of
comprehending infinite; so that Christ cannot be Deus factus, made of a creature a God, to comprehend
God; for then of finite he would become infinite, which is a contradiction. As the Spirit is God, because
he searches the deep things of God (1 Cor. 2:10), that is comprehends them,738 as the spirit of a man doth
the things of a man (now the spirit of man understands what it thinks, and what it wills), so the Spirit of
God understands what is in the understanding of God, and what is in the will of God. He hath an absolute
knowledge ascribed to him, and such as could not be ascribed to anything but a divinity: now if the Spirit
knows the deep things of God, and takes from Christ what he shows to us of him (John 16:15), he cannot
be ignorant of those things himself; he must know the depths of God, that affords us that Spirit, that is not
ignorant of any of the counsels of the Father’s will; since he comprehends the Father, and the Father him,
he is in himself infinite; for God whose essence is infinite, is infinitely knowable; but no created
understanding can infinitely know God. The infiniteness of the object hinders it from being understood by
anything that is not infinite. Though a creature should understand all the works of God, yet it cannot be
therefore said to understand God himself: as though I may understand all the volitions and motions of my
soul, yet it doth not follow that therefore I understand the whole nature and substance of my soul; or if a
man understood all the effects of the sun, that therefore he understands fully the nature of the sun. But
Christ knows the Father, he lay in the bosom of the Father, was in the greatest intimacy with him (John
1:18), and from this intimacy with him, he saw him and knew him; so he knows God as much as he is
knowable; and therefore knows him perfectly as the Father knows himself by a comprehensive vision; this
is the knowledge of God wherein properly the infiniteness of his understanding appears: and our Saviour
uses such expressions which manifest his knowledge to be above all created knowledge, and such a
manner of knowledge of the Father, as the Father hath of him.
</p>
<p>
    2. Christ knows all creatures. That knowledge which comprehends God, comprehends all created
things as they are in God; it is a knowledge that sinks to the depths of his will, and therefore extends to all
the acts of his will in creation and providence; by knowing the Father he knows all things that are
contained in the virtue, power, and will of God; “whatsoever the Father doth, that the Son doth” (John
5:19.) As the Father therefore knows all things he is the cause of, so doth the Son know all things he is the
worker of; as the perfect making of all things belongs to both, so doth the perfect knowledge of all things
belong to both; where the action is the same, the knowledge is the same. Now the Father did not create
one thing and Christ another; “but all things were created by him, and for him, all things both in heaven
and earth” (Col. 1:16): as he knows himself as the cause of all things, and the end of all things, he cannot
be ignorant of all things that were effected by him, and are referred to him; he knows all creatures in God,
as he knows the essence of God, and knows all creatures in themselves, as he knows his own acts and the
fruits of his power; those things must be in his knowledge that were in his power; all the treasures of the
wisdom and knowledge of God are hid in him (Col. 2:3). Now it is not the wisdom of God to know in
part, and be in part ignorant. He cannot be ignorant of anything, since there is nothing but what was made
by him John 1:3), and since it is less to know than create; for we know many things which we cannot
make.739 If he be the Creator, he cannot but be the discerner of what he made; this is a part of wisdom
belonging to an artificer, to know the nature and quality of what he makes. Since he cannot be ignorant of
what he furnished with being, and with various endowments, he must know them not only universally, but
particularly.
</p>
<p>
    3. Christ knows the heart and affections of men. Peter scruples not to ascribe to him this knowledge,
among the knowledge of all other things (John 21:17). “Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I
love thee.” From Christ’s knowledge of all things, he concludes his knowledge of the inward frames and
dispositions of men. To search the heart is the sole prerogative of God (1 Kings 8:39), for thou, even thou
only knowest the hearts of all the children of men: shall we take only here with a limitation, as some that
are no friends to the Deity of Christ would, and say, God only knows the hearts of men from himself, and
by his own infinite virtue? Why may we not take only in other places with a limitation, and make
nonsense of it, as Psalm 86:10, “Thou art God alone.” Is it to be understood that God is God alone from
himself, but other gods may be made by him, and so there may be numberless infinites? As God is God
alone, so that none can be God but himself; so he alone knows all the hearts of all the children of men,
and none but he can know them; this knowledge is from his nature. The reason why God knows the hearts
of men, is rendered in the Scripture double, because he created them, and because he is present
everywhere (Psalm 33:13, 15),740 these two are by the confession of Christians and Pagans universally
received as the proper characters of divinity, whereby the Deity is distinguished from all creatures. Now
when Christ ascribes this to himself, and that with such an emphasis, that nothing greater than that could
be urged, as he doth (Rev. 2:23), we must conclude that he is of the same essence with God, one with him
in his nature, as well as one with him in his attributes. God only knows the hearts of the children of men;
there is the unity of God: Christ searches the hearts and reins; there is a distinction of persons in a oneness
of essence; he knows the hearts of all men, not only of those that were with him in the time of the flesh,
that have been, and shall be, since his ascension; but of those that lived and died before his coming;
because he is to be the Judge of all that lived before his humiliation on earth, as well as after his exaltation
in heaven. It pertains to him, as a Judge, to know distinctly the merits of the cause of which he is to judge;
and this excellency of searching the hearts is mentioned by himself with relation to his judicial
proceeding, “I will give to every one of you according to your works.” And though a creature may know
what is in a man’s heart, if it be revealed to him, yet such a knowledge is a knowledge only by report, not
by inspection; yet this latter is ascribed to Christ (John 2:24, 25): “he knew all men, and needed not that
any should testify of man, for he knew what was in man:” he looked into their hearts. The Evangelist, to
allay the amazement of men at his relation of our Saviour’s nowledge of the inward falsity of those that
made a splendid profession of him, doth not say the Father revealed it to him, but intimates it to be an
unseparable property of his nature. No covering was so thick as to bound his eye; no pretence so glittering
as to impose upon his understanding. Those that made a profession of him, and could not be discerned by
the eye of man from his faithfulest attendants, were in their inside known to him plainer than their outside
was to others; and, therefore, he committed not himself to them, though they seemed to be persuaded to a
real belief in his name, because of the power of his miracles, and were touched with an admiration of him,
as some great prophet, and, perhaps, declared him to be the Messiah (ver. 23.)
</p>
<p>
     4. He had a foreknowledge of the particular inclinations of men, before those distinct inclinations
were in actual being in them. This is plainly asserted, John 6:64: “But there are some of you that believe
not; for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.”
When Christ assured them, from the knowledge of the hearts of his followers, that some of them were
void of that faith they professed, the Evangelist, to stop their amazement that Christ should have such a
power and virtue, adds, that he “knew from the beginning;” that he had not only a present knowledge, but
a foreknowledge, of every one’s inclination; he knew, not only now and then what was in the hearts of his
disciples, but from the beginning, of any one’s giving up their names to him; he knew whether it were a
pretence or sincere; he knew who should betray him; and there was no man’s inward affection but was
foreseen by him.741 “From the beginning,” whether we understand it from the beginning of the world, as
when Christ saith, concerning divorces, “From the beginning it was not so,” that is, from the beginning of
the world, from the beginning of the law of nature; or, from the beginning of their attending him, as it is
taken, Luke 1:2; he had a certain prescience of the inward dispositions of men’s hearts, and their
succeeding sentiments; he foreknew the treacherous heart of Judas in the midst of his splendid profession,
and discerned his resolution in the root, and his thought in the confused chaos of his natural corruption; he
knew how it would spring up before it did spring up, before Judas had any distinct and formal conception
of it himself, or before there was any actual preparation to a resolve. Peter’s denial was not unknown to
him, when Peter had a present resolution, and no question spake it in the present sincerity of his soul,
“never to forsake him;” he foreknew what would be the result of that poison which lurked in Peter’s
nature, before Peter himself imagined anything of it; he discerned Peter’s apostatizing heart, when Peter
resolved the contrary: our Saviour’s prediction was accomplished, and Peter’s valiant resolution
languished into cowardice. Shall we then conclude our blessed Saviour a creature, who perfectly and only
knew the Father, who knew all creatures; who had all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge who knew
the inward motions of men’s hearts by his own virtue, and had, not only a present knowledge, but a
prescience of them?
</p>
<p>
     Instruct. 2. The second instruction from this position, That God hath an infinite knowledge and
understanding. Then there is a providence exercised by God in the world, and that about everything. As
providence infers omniscience as the guide of it, so omniscience infers providence as the end of it. What
exercise would there be of this attribute, but in the government of the world? To this, this infinite
perfection refers (Jer. 17:10), “I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, to give every man according to
his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” He searches the heart to reward, he rewards every man
according to the rewardableness of his actions; his government, therefore, extends to every man in the
world; there is no heart but he searches, therefore no heart but he governs; to what purpose, else, would be
this knowledge of all his creatures? for a mere contemplation of them? No. What pleasure can that be to
God, who knows himself, who is infinitely more excellent than all his creatures? Doth he know them to
neglect all care of them? this must be either out of sloth; but how incompatible is laziness to a pure and
infinite activity! or out of majesty; but it is no less for the glory of his majesty to conduct them, than it
was for the glory of his power to erect them into being. He that counts nothing unworthy of his arms to
make, nothing unworthy of his understanding to know, why should he count anything unworthy of his
wisdom to govern? If he knows them to neglect them, it must be because he hath no will to it, or no
goodness for it; either of these would be a stain upon God; to want goodness is to be evil, and to want will
is to be negligent and scornful, which are inconsistent with an infinite, active goodness. Doth a father
neglect providing for the wants of the family which he knows? or a physician, the cure of that disease he
understands? God is omniscient, he therefore sees all things; he is good, he doth not therefore neglect
anything, but conducts it to the end he appointed it. There is nothing so little that can escape his
knowledge, and therefore nothing so little but falls under his providence; nothing so sublime as to be
above his understanding, and therefore nothing can be without the compass of his conduct; nothing can
escape his eye, and therefore nothing can escape his care; nothing is known to him in vain, as nothing was
made by him in vain; there must be acknowledged, therefore, some end of this knowledge of all his
creatures.
</p>
<p>
     Instruct. 3. Hence, then, will follow the certainty of a day of judgment. To what purpose can we
imagine this attribute of omniscience, so often declared and urged in Scripture to our consideration, but in
order to a government of our practice, and a future trial? Every perfection of the Divine nature hath sent
out brighter rays in the world than this of his infinite knowledge. His power hath been seen in the being of
the world, and his wisdom in the order and harmony of the creatures; his grace and mercy hath been
plentifully poured out in his mission of a Redeemer, and his justice hath been elevated by the dying
groans of the Son of God upon the cross. But hath his omniscience yet met with a glory proportionable to
that of his other perfections? All the attributes of God that have appeared in some beautiful glimmerings
in the world, wait for a more full manifestation in glory, as the creatures do for the “manifestation of the
sons of God” (Rom. 8:19); but especially this, since it hath been less evidenced than others, and as much,
or more, abused than any; it expects, therefore, a public righting in the eye of the world. There have been,
indeed, some few sparks of this perfection sensibly struck out now and then in the world in some horrors
of conscience, which have made men become their own accusers of unknown crimes, in bringing out
hidden wickedness to a public view by various providences. This hath also been the design of sprinklings
of judgments upon several generations, as (Psalm 90:8), “We are consumed by thy anger, and by thy
wrath we are troubled; thou hast set our iniquities before thee, and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.” The word ‫ צלומנו‬signifies youth, as well as secret, i. e., sins committed long ago, and that
with secrecy. By this he hath manifested that secret sins are not hid from his eye. Though inward terrors
and outward judgments have been let loose to worry men into a belief of this, yet the corruptions of men
would still keep a contrary notion in their minds, that “God hath forgotten, that he hides his face from
transgression, and will not regard their impiety” (Psalm 10:11). There must, therefore, be a time of trial
for the public demonstration of this excellency, that it may receive its due honor, by a full testimony that
no secrecy can be a shelter from it. As his justice, which consists in giving every one his due, could not be
glorified, unless men were called to an account for their actions, so neither would his omniscience appear
in its illustrious colors, without such a manfestation of the secret motions of men’s hearts, and of villanies
done under lock and key, when none were conscious to them, but the committers of them. Now the last
judgment is the time appointed for the “opening of the books” (Dan. 7:10). The book of God’s records,
and conscience the counterpart, were never fully opened and read before, only now and then some pages
turned to, in particular judgments; and out of those “books shall men be judged according to their works”
(Rev. 20:12). Then shall the defaced sins be brought, with all their circumstances, to every man’s
memory; the counsels of men’s hearts fled far from their present remembrance, all the habitual knowledge
they had of their own actions, shall, by God’s knowledge of them, be excited to an actual review; and
their works not only made manifest to themselves, but notorious to the world: all the words, thoughts,
deeds of men, shall be brought forth into the light of their own minds by the infinite light of God’s
understanding reflecting on them. His knowledge renders him an unerring witness, as well as his justice
“a swift witness” (Mal. 3:5); a swift witness, because he shall, without any circuit, or length of speech,
convince their consciences, by an inward illumination of them, to take notice of the blackness and
deformity of their hearts and works. In all judgments God is somewhat known to be the searcher of hearts;
the time of judgment is the time of his remembrance (Hos. 8:13): “Now will he remember their iniquity,
and visit their sins;” but the great instant, or now, of the full glorifying it, is the grand day of account. This
attribute must have a time for its full discovery; and no time can be fit for it but a time of a general
reckoning. Justice cannot be exercised without omniscience; for as justice is a giving to every one his due,
so there must be knowledge to discern what is due to every man; the searching the heart is in order to the
rewarding the works.

     Instruct 4. This perfection in God gives us ground to believe a resurrection. Who can think this too
hard for his power, since not the least atom of the dust of our bodies can escape his knowledge? An
infinite understanding comprehends every mite of a departed carcase; this will not appear impossible, nor
irrational, to any, upon a serious consideration, of this excellency in God. The body is perished, the matter
of it hath been since clothed with different forms and figures; part of it hath been made the body of a
worm, part of it returned to the dust that hath been blown away by the wind; part of it hath been concocted
in the bodies of canibals, fish, ravenous beasts; the spirits have evaporated into air, part of the blood
melted into water; what, then, is the matter of the body annihilated? is that wholly perished? no; the
foundation remains, though it hath put on a variety of forms; the body of Abel, the first man that died, nor
the body of Adam, are not, to this day, reduced to nothing; indeed, the quantity and the quality of those
bodies have been lost by various changes they have past through since their dissolution; but the matter, or
substance of them, remains entire, and is not capable to be destroyed by all those transforming alterations,
in so long a revolution of time. The body of a man in his infancy and his old age, if it were Methuselah’s,
is the same in the foundation in those multitude of years; though the quantity of it be altered, the quality
different; though the color and other things be changed in it, the matter of this body remains the same
among all the alterations after death. And can it be so mixed with other natures and creatures, as that it is
past finding out by an infinite understanding? Can any particle of this matter escape the eye of Him that
makes and beholds all those various alterations, and where every mite of the substance of those bodies is
particularly lodged, so as that he cannot compact it together again for a habitation of that soul, that many a
year before fled from it?742 Since the knowledge of God is infinite, and his providence extensive over the
least as well as the greatest parts of the world, he must needs know the least as well as the greatest of his
creatures in their beginning, progress, and dissolution; all the forms through which the bodies of all
creatures roll, the particular instants of time, and the particular place when and where those changes are
made, they are all present with him; and, therefore, when the revolution of time allotted by him for the
reunion of souls and deceased bodies is come, it cannot be doubted but, out of the treasures of his
knowledge, he can call forth every part of the matter of the bodies of men, from the first to the last man
that expired, and strip it of all those forms and figures which it shall then have, to compact it to be a
lodging for that soul which before it entertained; and though the bodies of men have been devoured by
wild beasts in the earth, and fish in the sea, and been lodged in the stomachs of barbarous men-eaters, the
matter is not lost. There is but little of the food we take that is turned into the substance of our own
bodies; that which is not proper for nourishment, which is the greatest part, is separated, and concocted,
and rejected; whatsoever objections are made, are answered by this attribute. Nothing hinders a God of
infinite knowledge from discerning every particle of the matter, wheresoever it is disposed; and since he
hath an eye to discern, and a hand to recollect and unite, what difficulty is there in believing this article of
the christian faith? he that questions this revealed truth of the resurrection of the body, must question
God’s omniscience as well as his omnipotence and power.

     Instruct. 5. What semblance of reason is there to expect a justification in the sight of God by anything
in ourselves? Is there any action done by any of us, but upon a scrutiny we may find flaws and deficiency
in it? What then? shall not this perfection of God discern them? the motes that escape our eyes cannot
escape his (1 John 3:20): “God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things;” so that it is in vain for
any man to flatter himself with the rectitude of any work, or enter into any debate with him who can bring
a thousand articles against us, out of his own infinite records, unknown to us, and unanswerable by us. If
conscience, a representative or counterpart of God’s omniscience in our own bosoms, find nothing done
by us, but in a copy short of the original, and beholds, if not blurs, yet imperfections in the best actions,
God must much more discern them; we never knew a copy equally exact with the original. If our own
conscience be as a thousand witnesses, the knowledge of God is as millions of witnesses against us; if our
corruption be so great, and our holiness so low, in our own eyes, how much greater must the one, and how
much meaner must the other, appear in the eyes of God? God hath an unerring eye to see, as well as an
unspotted holiness to hate, and an unbribable justice to punish; he wants no more understanding to know
the shortness of our actions, than he doth holiness to enact, and power to execute, his laws; nay, suppose
we could recollect many actions, wherein there were no spot visible to us, the consideration of this
attribute should scare us from resting upon any or all of them, since it is the Lord that, by a piercing eye,
sees and judges according to the heart, and not according to appearance. The least crookedness of a stick,
not sensible to an acute eye, yet will appear when laid to the line; and the impurity of a counterfeit metal
be manifest when applied to the touchstone; so will the best action of any mere man in the world, when it
comes to be measured in God’s knowledge by the straight line of his law. Let every, man, therefore, as
Paul, though he should know nothing by himself, think not himself therefore justified; since it is the Lord,
who is of an infinite understanding, that judgeth (1 Cor. 4:4). A man may be justified in his own sight,
“but not any living man can be justified in the sight of God” (Psalm 143:2); in his sight, whose eye
pierceth into our unknown secrets and frames: it was, therefore, well answered of a good man upon his
death bed, being asked “What he was afraid of?” “I have labored,” saith he, “with all my strength to
observe the commands of God; but since I am a man, I am ignorant whether my works are acceptable to
God, since God judges in one manner, and I in another manner.” Let the consideration therefore of this
attribute, make us join with Job in his resolution (Job 9:21): “Though we were perfect, yet would we not
know our own souls.” I would not stand up to plead any of my virtues before God. Let us, therefore, look
after another righteousness, wherein the exact eye of the Divine omniscience, we are sure, can discern no
stain or crookedness.

not honor a man that is able to predict? do we not think it a great part of wisdom? Have not all nations
regarded such a faculty as a character and a mark of divinity? There is something more ravishing in the
knowledge of future things, both to the person that knows them, and the person that hears them, than there
is in any other kind of knowledge; whence the greatest prophets have been accounted in the greatest
veneration, and men have thought it a way to glory, to divine and predict. Hence it was that the devils and
pagan oracles gained so much credit; upon this foundation were they established, and the enemies of
mankind owned for a true God;—I say, from the prediction of future things, though their oracles were
often ambiguous, many times false; yet those poor heathens framed many ingenious excuses to free their
adored gods from the charge of falsity and imposture: and shall we not adore the true God, the God of
Israel, the God blessed for ever, for this incommunicable property, whereby he flies above the wings of
the wind, the understandings of men and cherubims?743 Consider how great it is to know the thoughts and
intentions, and works of one man, from the beginning to the end of his life; to foreknow all these before
the being of this man, when he was lodged afar off in the loins of his ancestors, yea, of Adam; how much
greater is it to foreknow and know the thoughts and works of three or four men, of a whole village or
neighborhood! It is greater still to know the imaginations and actions of such a multitude of men as are
contained in London, Paris, or Constantinople; how much greater still to know the intentions and
practices, the clandestine contrivances of so many millions that have, do, or shall swarm in all quarters of
the world, every person of them having millions of thoughts, desires, designs, affections, and actions! Let
this attribute, then, make the blessed God honorable in our eyes, and adorable in all our affections;
especially since it is an excellency which hath so lately discovered itself, in bringing to light the hidden
things of darkness, in opening, and in part confounding, the wicked devices of bloody men. Especially let
us adore God for it, and admire it in God, since it is so necessary a perfection, that without it the goodness
of God had been impotent, and could not have relieved us; for what help can a distressed person expect
from a man of the sweetest disposition and the strongest arm, if the eyes which should discover the
danger, and direct the defence and rescue, were closed up by blindness and darkness? Adore God for this
wonderful perfection.
</p>
<p>
     Instruct. 7. In the consideration of this excellent attribute, what low thoughts should we have of our
own knowledge, and how humble ought we to be before God! There is nothing man is more apt to be
proud of than his knowledge; it is a perfection he glories in; but if our own knowledge of the little outside
and barks of things puffs us up, the consideration of the infiniteness of God’s knowledge should abate the
tumor: as our beings are nothing in regard to the infiniteness of his essence, so our knowledge is nothing
in regard of the vastness of his understanding. We have a spark of being, but nothing to the heat of the
sun; we have a drop of knowledge, but nothing to the Divine ocean. What a vain thing is it for a shallow
brook to boast of its streams before a sea, whose depths are unfathomable! As it is a vanity to brag of our
strength, when we remember the power of God, and of our prudence, when we glance upon the wisdom of
God, so it is no less a vanity to boast of our knowledge, when we think of the understanding and
knowledge of God. How hard is it for us to know anything!744 Too much noise deafens us, and too much
liglit dazzles us; too much distance alienates the object from us, and too much nearness bars up our sight
from beholding it. When we think ourselves to be near the knowledge of a thing, as a ship to the haven, a
puff of wind blows us away, and the object which we desired to know eternally flies from us; we burn
with a desire of knowledge, and yet are oppressed with the darkness of ignorance; we spend our days
more in dark Egypt, than in enlightened Goshen. In what narrow bounds is all the knowledge of the most
intelligent persons included!745 How few understand the exact harmony of their own bodies, the nature of
the life they have in common with other animals! Who understands the nature of his own faculties, how
he knows, and how he wills; how the understanding proposeth, and how the will embraceth; how his
spiritual soul is united to his material body; what the nature is of the operation of our spirits? Nay, who
understands the nature of his own body, the offices of his senses, the motion of his members, how they
come to obey the command of the will, and a thousand other things? What a vain, weak, and ignorant
thing is man, when compared with God! yet there is not a greater pride to be found among devils, than
among ignorant men, with a little, very little, flashy knowledge. Ignorant man is as proud as if he knew as
God. As the consideration of God’s omniscience should render him honorable in our eyes, so it should
render us vile in our own. God, because of his knowledge, is so far from disdaining his creatures, that his
omniscience is a minister to his goodness. No knowledge that we are possessed of should make us swell
with too high a conceit of ourselves, and a disdain of others. We have infinitely more of ignorance than
knowledge. Let us therefore remember, in all our thoughts of God, that he is God, and we are men; and
therefore ought to be humble, as becomes men, and ignorant and foolish men, to be; as weak creatures
should lie low before an Almighty God, and impure creatures before a holy God, false creatures before a
faithful God, finite creatures before an infinite God, so should ignorant creatures before an all-knowing
God. All God’s attributes teach admiring thoughts of God, and low thoughts of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
     Instruct. 8. It may inform us how much this attribute is injured in the world. The first error after
Adam’s eating the forbidden fruit was the denial of this, as well as the omnipresence of God, (Gen. 3:10,)
“I heard thy voice in the garden, and I hid myself;” as if the thickness of the trees could screen him from
the eye of his Creator. And after Cain’s murder, this is the first perfection he affronts, (Gen. 4:9), “Where
is Abel, thy brother?” saith God. How roundly doth he answer, “I know not!” as if God were as weak as
man, to be put off with a lie. Man doth as naturally hate this perfection as much as he cannot naturally but
acknowledge it; he wishes God stripped of this eminency, that he might be incapable to be an inspector of
his crimes, and a searcher of the closets of his heart. In wishing him deprived of this, there is a hatred of
God himself; for it is a loathing an essential property of God, without which be would be a pitiful
Governor of the world. What a kind of God should that be, of a sinner’s wishing, that had wanted eyes to
see a crime, and righteousness to punish it! The want of the consideration of this attribute, is the cause of
all sin in the world (Hos. 7:2), “They consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness;”
they speak not to their hearts, or make any reflection upon the infiniteness of my knowledge; it is a high
contempt of God, as if he were an idol, a senseless stock or stone; in all evil practices this is denied. We
know God sees all things, yet we live and walk as if he knew nothing. We call him omniscient, and live as
if he were ignorant; we say he is all eye, yet act as if he were wholly blind.
</p>
<p>
     In particular, this attribute is injured, by invading the peculiar rights of it, by presuming on it, and by a
practical denial of it. First, By invading the peculiar rights of it. 1. By invocation of creatures. Praying to
saints, by the Romanists, is a disparagement to this divine excellency; he that knows all things, is only fit
to have the petitions of men presented to him; prayer supposeth an omniscient Being, as the object of it;
no other being but God ought to have that honor acknowledged to it; no understanding but his is infinite;
no other presence but his is everywhere; to implore any deceased creature for a supply of our wants, is to
own in them a property of the Deity, and make them deities that were but men, and increase their glory by
a diminution of God’s honor, in ascribing that perfection to creatures which belongs only to God. Alas!
they are so far from understanding the desires of our souls, that they know not the words of our lips: it is
against reason to address our supplications to them that neither understand us nor discern us (Isa. 63:16),
“Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledges us not” The Jews never called upon Abraham,
though the covenant was made with him for the whole seed; not one departed saint for the whole four
thousand years, between the creation of the world, and the coming of Christ, was ever prayed to by the
Israelites, or ever imagined to have a share in God’s omniscience: so that to pray to St. Peter, St. Paul,
much less to St. Roch, St Swithin, St. Martin, St. Francis, &amp;c. is such a superstition, that hath no footing
in the Scripture. To desire the prayers of the living, with whom we have a communion, who can
understand and grant our desires, is founded upon a mutual charity; but to implore persons that are absent,
at a great distance from us, with whom we have not, nor know how to have, any commerce, supposeth
them, in their departure, to have put off humanity, and commenced gods, and endued with some part of
the Divinity to understand our petitions; we are, indeed, to cherish their memories, consider their
examples, imitate their graces, and observe their doctrines; we are to follow them as saints, but not elevate
them as gods, in ascribing to them such a knowledge, which is the only necessary right of their and our
common Creator.746 As the invocation of saints mingles them with Christ, in the exercise of his office, so
it sets them equal with God in the throne of his omniscience, as if they had as much credit with God as
Christ, by way of mediation, and as much knowledge of men’s affairs as God himself. Omniscience is
peculiar to God, and incommunicable to any creature; it is the foundation of all religion, and therefore one
of the choicest acts of it; viz. prayer and invocation. To direct our vows and petitions to any one else, is to
invade the peculiarity of this perfection in God, and to rank some creatures in a partnership with him in it.
</p>
<p>
     2. This attribute is injured by curiosity of knowledge; especially of future things, which God hath not
discovered in natural causes, or supernatural revelation. It is a common error of men’s spirits to aspire to
know what God would have hidden, and to pry into Divine secrets; and many men are more willing to
remain without the knowledge of those things which may, with a little industry, be attained, than be
divested of the curiosity of inquiring into those things which are above their reach; it is hence that some
have laid aside the study of the common remedies of nature to find out the philosopher’s stone, which
scarce any ever yet attempted but sunk in the enterprise.747 From this inclination to know the most
abstruse and difficult things, it is that the horrors of magic and vanities of astrology have sprung, whereby
men have thought to find, in a commerce with devils and the jurisdiction of the stars, the events of their
lives, and the disposal of states and kingdoms. Hence, also, arose those multitudes of ways of divination,
invented among the heathen, and practised too commonly in these ages of the world. This is an invasion
of God’s prerogative, to whom secret things belong (Deut. 29:29); “Secret things belong unto the Lord
our God, but revealed things belong to us and our children.” It is an intolerable boldness to attempt to
fathom those, the knowledge whereof God hath reserved to himself, and to search that which God will
have to surpass our understandings, whereby we more truly envy God a knowledge superior to our own,
than we, in Adam, imagined that he envied us. Ambition is the greatest cause of this; ambition to be
accounted some great thing among men, by reason of a knowledge estranged from the common mass of
mankind, but more especially that soaring pride to be equal with God, which lurks in our nature ever since
the fall of our first parents: this is not yet laid aside by men, though it was the first thing that embroiled
the world with the wrath of God. Some think a curiosity of knowledge was the cause of the fall of devils;
I am sure it was the fall of Adam, and is yet the crime of his posterity; had he been contented to know
what God had furnished him with, neither he nor his posterity had smarted under the venom of the
serpent’s breath. All curious and bold inquiries into things not revealed are an attempt upon the throne of
God, and are both sinful and pernicious, like to glaring upon the sun, where, instead of a greater
acuteness, we meet with blindness, and too dearly buy our ignorance in attempting a superfluous
knowledge. As God’s knowledge is destined to the government of the world, so should ours be to the
advantage of the world, and not degenerate into vain speculations.
</p>
<p>
     3. This attribute is injured by swearing by creatures. To swear by the name of God, in a righteous
cause,748 when we are lawfully called to it by a superior power, or for the necessary decision of some
controversy, for the ends of charity and justice, is an act of religion, and a part of worship, founded upon,
and directed to, the honor of this attribute; by it we acknowledge the glory of his infallible knowledge of
all things; but to swear by false gods, or by any creature, is blasphemous; it sets the creature in the place
of God, and invests it in that which is the peculiar honor of the Divinity; for when any swear truly, they
intend the invocation of an infallible Witness, and the bringing an undoubted testimony for what they do
assert: while, any, therefore, swear by a creature, or a false god, they profess that that creature, or that
which they esteem to be a god is an infallible witness, which to be is only the right of God; they attribute
to the creature that which is the property of God alone, to know the heart, and to be a witness whether
they speak true or no: and this was accounted, by all nations, the true design of an oath. As to swear
falsely is a plain denial of the all-knowledge of God, so to swear by any creature is to set the creature
upon the throne of God, in ascribing that perfection to the creature which sovereignly belongs to the
Creator; for it is not in the power of any to witness to the truth of the heart, but of him that is the searcher
of hearts.
</p>
<p>
     4. We sin against this attribute by censuring the hearts of others. An open crime, indeed, falls under
our cognizance, and therefore under our judgment; for whatsoever falls under the authority of man to be
punished, falls under the judgment of man to be censured, as an act contrary to the law of God; yet, when
a censure is built upon the evil of the act which is obvious to the view, if we take a step farther to judge
the heart and state, we leave the revealed rule of the law, and ambitiously erect a tribunal equal with
God’s, and usurp a judicial power, pertaining only to the Supreme Governor of the world, and
consequently pretend to be possessed of the perfection of omniscience, which is necessary to render him
capable of the exercise of that sovereign authority: for it is in respect of his dominion that God hath the
supreme right to judge; and in respect of his knowledge that he hath an incommunicable capacity to judge.
In an action that is doubtful, the good or evil whereof depends only upon God’s determination, and
wherein much of the judgment depends upon the discerning the intention of the agent, we cannot judge
any man without a manifest invasion of God’s peculiar right such actions are to be tried by God’s
knowledge, not by our surmises; God only is the master in such cases, to whom a person stands or falls
(Rom. 14:4). ’Till the true principle and ends of an action be known by the confession of the party acting
it, a true judgment of it is not in our power. Principles and ends lie deep and hid from us; and it is
intolerable pride to pretend to have a joint key with God to open that cabinet which he hath reserved to
himself: Besides the violation of the rule of charity in misconstruing actions which may be great and
generous in their root and principle, we invade God’s right, as if our ungrounded imaginations and
conjectures were in joint commission with this sovereign perfection; and thereby we become usurping
judges of evil thoughts (James 2:4). It is, therefore, a boldness worthy to be punished by the judge, to
assume to ourselves the capacity and authority of him who is the only Judge: for as the execution of the
Divine law, for the inward violation of it, belongs only to God, so is the right of judging a prerogative
belonging only to his omniscience; his right is, therefore, invaded, if we pretend to a knowledge of it. This
humor of men the apostle checks, when he saifh (1 Cor. 4:5), “He that judgeth me is the Lord; therefore
judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will manifest the counsels of all hearts.” It is not
the time yet for God to erect the tribunal for the trial of men’s hearts, and the principles of their actions;
he hath reserved the glorious discovery of this attribute for another season: we must not, therefore,
presume to judge of the counsels of men’s hearts till God hath revealed them by opening the treasures of
his own knowledge; much less are we to judge any man’s final condition. Manasseh may sacrifice to
devils, and unconverted Paul tear the church in pieces; but God had mercy on them, and called them. The
actions may be censured, not the state, for we know not whom God may call. In censuring men, we may
doubly imitate the devil, in a false accusation of the brethren, as well as in an ambitious usurpation of the
rights of God.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, This perfection is injured by presuming upon it, or making an ill use of it. As in the neglect
of prayer for the supply of men’s wants, because God knows them already, so that that which is an
encouragement to prayer, they make the reason of restraining it before God. Prayer is not to administer
knowledge to God, but to acknowledge this admirable perfection of the Divine nature. If God did not
know, there were indeed no use of prayer; it would be as vain a thing to send up our prayers to heaven, as
to implore the senseless statue, or picture of a prince, for a protection. We pray because God knows: for
though he knows our wants with a knowledge of vision, yet he will not know them with a knowledge of
supply, till he be sought unto (Matt. 6:32, 33; 7:11.) All the excellencies of God are ground of adoration;
and this excellency is the ground of that part of worship we call prayer. If God be to be worshipped, he is
to be called upon: invocations of his name in our necessities is a chief act of worship; whence the temple,
the place of solemn worship, was not called the house of sacrifice, but the house of prayer. Prayer was not
appointed for God’s information, as if he were ignorant, but for the expression of our desires; not to
furnish him with a knowledge of what we want, but to manifest to him, by some rational sign convenient
to our nature, our sense of that want, which he knows by himself. So that prayer is not designed to
acquaint God with our wants, but to express the desire of a remedy of our wants. God knows our wants,
but hath not made promises barely to our wants, but to our asking, that his omniscience in hearing, as well
as his sufficiency in supplying, many have a sensible honor in our acknowledgments and receipts. It is
therefore an ill use of this excellency of God to neglect prayer to him as needless, because he knows
already.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly. This perfection of God is wronged by a practical denial of it. It is the language of every sin,
and so God takes it when he comes to reckon with men for their impieties. Upon this he charges the
greatness of the iniquity of Israel, the overflowing of blood in the land, and the perverseness of the city:
“They say, the Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord sees not” (Ezek. 9:9): they deny his ayes to see,
and his resolution to punish.
</p>
<p>
    1. It will appear, in forbearing sin from a sense of man’s knowledge, not of God’s. Open impieties are
refrained because of the eye of man, but secret sins are not checked because of the eye of God.
Wickedness is committed in darkness, that is restrained in light, as if darkness were as great a clog to
God’s eyes as it is to ours; as though his eyes were muffled with the curtains of the night (Job 22:14.)
This, it is likely, was at the root of Jonah’s flight; he might have some secret thought that his Master’s eye
could not follow him, as though the close hatches of a ship could secure him from the knowledge of God,
as well as the sides of a ship could from the dashing of the waves. What lies most upon the conscience
when it is graciously wounded, is least regarded or contemned when it is basely inclined. David’s heart
smote him not only for his sin in the gross, but as particularly cirumstantiated by the commission of it in
the sight of God (Psalm 1:4): “Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.” None
knew the reason of Uriah’s death but myself, and because others knew it not, I neglected any regard to
this Divine eye. When Jacob’s sons used their brother Joseph so barbarously, they took care to hide it
from their father, but cast away all thoughts of God, from whom it could not be concealed. Doth not the
presence of a child bridle a man from the act of a longed-for sin, when the eye of God is of no force to
restrain him, as if God’s knowledge were of less value than the sight of a little boy or girl, as if a child
only, could see, and God were blind? He that will forbear an unworthy action for fear of an informer, will
not forbear it for God; as if God’s omniscience were not as full an intelligencer to him, as man can be an
informer to a magistrate. As we acknowledge the power of men seeing us when we are ashamed to
commit a filthy action in their view, so we discover the power of God seeing us, when we regard not what
we do before the light of his eyes. Secret sins are more against God than open: open sins are against the
law; secret sins are against the law, and this prime perfection of his nature. The majesty of God is not only
violated, but the omniscience of God disowned, who is the only witness; we must, in all of them, either
imagine him to be without eyes to behold us, or without an arm of justice to punish us. And often it is, I
believe, in such cases, that if any thoughts of God’s knowledge strike upon men, they quickly damp them,
lest they should begin to know what they fear, and fear that they might not eat their pleasant sinful
morsels.
</p>
<p>
    2. It appears in partial confessions of sin before God. As by a free, full, and ingenious confession, we
offer a due glory to this attribute, so by a feigned and curtailed confession, we deny him the honor of it:
for, though by any confession we in part own him to be a Sovereign and Judge, yet by a half and pared
acknowledgment, we own him to be no more than a humane and ignorant one. Achan’s full confession
gave God the glory of his omniscience, manifested in the discovery of his secret crime. “And Joshua said
unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and tnakc confession unto him”
(Joshua 7:19.) And so (Psalm 50:23) “Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me,” or confession, as the word
signifieth, in which sense I would rather take it, referring to this attribute, which God seems to tax sinners
with the denial of (ver. 21), telling them that he would open the records of their sins before them, and
indict them particularly for every one. If, therefore, you would glorify this attribute, which shall one day
break open your consciences, offer to me a sincere confession. When David speaks of the happiness of a
pardoned man, he adds, “in whose spirit there is no guile,”749 not meaning a sincerity in general, but an
ingenuity in confessing. To excuse, or extenuate sin, is to deny God the knowledge of the depths of our
deceitful hearts: when we will mince it rather than aggravate it; lay it upon the inducements of others,
when it was the free act of our own wills, study shifts to deceive our Judge; this is to speak lies of him, as
the expression is (Hos. 7:13), as though he were a God easy to be cheated, and knew no more than we
were willing to declare. What did Saul’s transferring his sin from himself to the people (1 Sam. 14:15),
but charge God with a defect in this attribute? When man could not be like God, in his knowledge, he
would fancy a God like to him in his ignorance, and imagine a possibility of hiding himself from his
knowledge. And all men tread, more or less, in their father’s steps, and are fruitful to devise distinctions
to disguise errors in doctrine, and excuses to palliate errors in practice: this crime Job removes from
himself, when he speaks of several acts of his sincerity (Job 31:33): “If I covered my transgressions as
Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:” I hid not any of my sins in my own conscience, but
acknowledged God a witness to them, and gave him the glory of his knowledge by a free confession. I did
not conceal it from God as Adam did, or as men ordinarily do; as if God could understand no more of
their secret crimes than they will let him, and had no more sense of their faults than they would furnish
him with. As the first rise of confession is the owning of this attribute (for the justice of God would not
scare men, nor the holiness of God awe them, without a sense of his knowledge of their iniquities), so to
drop out some fragments of confession, discover some sins, and conceal others, is a plain denial of the
extensiveness of the Divine knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    3. It is discovered by putting God off with an outside worship. Men are often flatterers of God, and
think to bend him by formal glavering devotions, without the concurrence of their hearts; as though he
could not pierce into the darkness of the mind, but did as little know us as one man knows another. There
are such things as feigned lips (Psalm 17:1), a contradiction between the heart and the tongue, a clamor in
the voice, and scoffing in the soul; a crying out to God, thou art my Father, the guide of my youth, and yet
speaking and doing evil to the utmost of our power (Jer. 3:4, 5). As if God could be imposed upon by
fawning pretences; and like old Isaac, take Jacob for Esau, and be cozened by the smell of his garments:
as if he could not discern the negro heart under an angel’s garb. Thus Ephraim, the ten tribes, apostatized
from the true religion, would go with their flocks and their herds to seek the Lord (Hos. 5:6), would
sacrifice multitudes of sheep and heifers, which was the main outside of the Jewish religion; only with
their flocks and their herds, not with their hearts, with those inward qualifications of deep humiliation and
repentance for sin; as though outside appearances limited God’s observation, whereas God had told them
before (ver. 3), that he “knew Ephraim, and Israel was not hid from him.” Thus to do is to put a cheat
upon God, and think to blind his all-seeing eye, and therefore it is called deceit (Psalm 78:36). They did
flatter him with their mouths. The word ‫ פתּה‬signifies to deceive, as well as to flatter; not that they or any
else, can deceive God, but it implies an endeavor to deceive him, by a few dissembling words and
gestures, or an imagination that God was satisfied with bare professions, and would not concern himself
in a further inquisition. This is an unworthy conceit of God, to fancy that we can satisfy for inward sins,
and avert approaching judgments, by external offerings, by a loud voice with a false heart, as if God (like
children) would be pleased with the glittering of an empty shell, or the rattling of stones, the chinkling of
money, a mere voice and crying, without inward frames and intentions of service.
</p>
<p>
     4. In cherishing multitudes of evil thoughts. No man but would blush for shame, if the base, impure,
slovenly thoughts, either in or out of duties of worship, were visible to the understanding of man; how
diligent would he be to curb his luxuriant and unworthy fancies, as well as bite in his words! but when we
give the reins to the motions of our hearts, and suffer them to run at random without a curb, it is an
evidence we are not concerned for their falling under the notice of the eye of God; and it argues a very
weak belief of this perfection, or scarce any belief at all. Who can think any man’s heart, possessed with a
sense of this infinite excellency, that suffers his mind, in his meditations on God, to wander into every sty,
and be picking up stones upon a dunghill? What doth it intimate, but that those thoughts are as invisible,
or unaudible to God, as they are to men without the garments of words?750 When a man thinks of obscene
things, his own natural notions, if revived, would tell him that God discerns what he thinks, that the
depths of his heart are open to him: and the voice of those notions are—deface those vain imaginations
out of your minds. But what is done? Men cast away rational light, muster up conceits that God sees them
not, knows them not, and so sink into the puddle of their sordid imaginations, as though they remained in
darkness to God. I might further instance. In omissions of prayer, which arise sometimes from a flat
atheism: who will call upon a God, that believes no such Being? or from partial atheism, either a denial of
God’s sufficiency to help, or of his omniscience to know, as if God were like the statue of Jupiter in
Crete, framed without ears. In the hypocritical pretences of men, to exempt them from the service God
calls them to. When men pretend one thing and intend another: this lurks in the veins sometimes of the
best men; sometimes it ariseth from the fear of man; when men are more afraid of the power of man, than
of dissembling with the Almighty, it will pretend a virtue to cover a secret wile, and choose the tongue of
the crafty as the expression in Job (ch. 15:5). The case is plain in Moses, who, when ordered to undertake
an eminent service, pretends a want of eloquence, and an ungrateful “slowness of speech” (Exod. 4:10).
This generous soul, that before was not afraid to discover himself in the midst of Egypt for his
countrymen, answers sneakingly to God, and would veil his carnal fear with a pretence of insufficiency
and humility; “Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh?” (Exod. 3:11) He could not well allege an
inability to go to Pharaoh, since he had had an education in the Egyptian learning, which rendered him
capable to appear at court. God at last uncaseth him, and shews it all to be a dissimulation, and
whatsoever was the pretence, fear lay at the bottom. He was afraid of his life upon his appearance before
Pharaoh, from whose face he had fled upon the slaying the Egyptians; which God intimates to him (Exod.
4:19), “Go, and return into Egypt, for all the men are dead which sought thy life.” What doth this carriage
speak, but as if God’s eye were not upon our inward parts, as though we could lock him out of our hearts,
that cannot be shut out from any creek of the hearts of men and angels?
</p>
<p>
    Use II. is of comfort. It is a ground of great comfort under the present dispensation wherein we are;
we have heard the doctrinal part, and God hath given us the experimental part of it in his special
providence this day, upon the stage of the world.751 And, blessed be God; that he hath given us a ground
of comfort, without going out of our ordinary course to fetch it, whereby it seems to be peculiarly of
God’s ordering for us.
</p>
<p>
    1. It is a comfort in all the clandestine contrivances of men against the church. His eyes pierce as far
as the depths of hell. Not one of his church’s adversaries lies in a mist; all are as plain as the stars which
he numbers: “Mine adversaries are all before thee” (Psalm 69:19), more exactly known to thee than I can
recount them. It is a prophecy of Christ, wherein Christ is brought in speaking to God of his own and the
church’s enemies: he comforts himself with this, that God hath his eye upon every particular person
among his adversaries: he knows where they repose themselves, when they go out to consult, and when
they come in with their resolves. He discerns all the rage that spirits their hearts, in what corner it lurks,
how it acts; all the disorders, motions of it, and every object of that rage; he cannot be deceived by the
closest and subtlest person. Thus God speaks concerning Sennacherib and his host against Jerusalem (Isa.
37:28, 29). After he had spoke of the forming of his church, and the weakness of it, he adds, “But I know
thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. Because thy rage against me,
and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy
lips, and I will turn thee back,” &amp;c. He knows all the methods of the counsels, the stages they had laid, the
manner of the execution of their designs, all the ways whither they turned themselves, and would use
them no better than men do devouring fish and untamed beasts, with a hook in the nose, and a bridle in
the mouth. Those statesmen (in Isa. 29:15) thought their contrivances too deep for God to fathom, and too
close for God to frustrate; “they seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; surely your turning of
things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay,” of no more force and understanding than a
potter’s vessel, which understands not its own form wrought by the artificer, nor the use it is put to by the
buyer and possessor; or shall be esteemed as a potter’s vessel, that can be as easily flung back into the
mass from whence it was taken, as preserved in the figure it is now endued with. No secret designer is
shrouded from God’s sight, or can be sheltered from God’s arm; he understands the venom of their hearts
better than we can feel it, and discovers their inward fury more plainly than we can see the sting or teeth
of a viper when they are opened for mischief; and to what purpose doth God know and see them, but in
order to deliver his people from them in his own due time? “I know their sorrow, and am come down to
deliver them.” (Exod. 3:7, 8). The walls of Jerusalem are continually before him; he knows, therefore, all
that would undermine and demolish them; none can hurt Zion by any ignorance or inadvertency in God. It
is observable, that our Saviour, assuming to himself a different title in every epistle to the seven churches,
Both particularly ascribe to himself this of knowledge and wrath in that to Thyatira, an emblem or
description of the Romish state (Rev. 2:18): “And unto the angel of the church of Thyatira write, These
things, saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass.” His eyes,
like a flame of fire, are of a piercing nature, insinuating themselves into all the pores and parts of the body
they encounter with, and his feet like brass, to crush them with, is explained (ver. 23), “I will kill her
children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and the heart,
and I will give to every one of you according to your works.” He knows every design of the Romish
party, designed by that church of Thyatira.752 Jezebel, there, signifies a whorish church; such a church as
shall act as Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, who was not only a worshipper of idols, but propagated idolatry in
Israel, slew the prophets, persecuted Elijah, murdered Naboth, the name whereof signifies prophecy,
seized upon his possession. And if it be said that (ver. 19) this church was commended for her works,
faith, patience, it is true Rome did at first strongly profess Christianity, and maintained the interest of it,
but afterwards fell into the practice of Jezebel, and committed spiritual adultery: and is she to be owned
for a wife, that now plays the harlot, because she was honest and modest at her first marriage? And
though she shall be destroyed, yet not speedily (ver. 22); “I will cast her into a bed,” seems to intimate the
destruction of Jezebel, not to be at once and speedily, but in a lingering way, and by degrees, as sickness
consumes a body.753

    2. This perfection of God fits him to be a special object of trust. If he were forgetful, what comfort
could we have in any promise? How could we depend upon him, if he were ignorant of our state? His
compassion to pity us, his readiness to relieve us, his power to protect and assist us, would be
insignificant, without his omniscience to inform his goodness, and direct the arm of his power. This
perfection is, as it were, God’s office of intelligence: as you go to your memorandum-book to know what
you are to do, so doth God to his omniscience; this perfection is God’s eye, to acquaint him with the
necessities of his church, and directs all his other attributes in their exercise for and about his people. You
may depend upon his mercy that hath promised, and upon his truth to erform; upon his sufficiency to
supply you, and his goodness to receive you, and his righteousness to reward you; because he hath an
infinite understanding to know you and your wants, you and your services. And without this knowledge
of his, no comfort could be drawn from any other perfection; none of them could be a sure nail to hang
our hopes and confidence upon. This is that the church alway celebrated (Psalm 105:7): “He hath
remembered his covenant forever, and the word which he hath commanded to a thousand generations;”
and (ver. 42), “He remembered his holy promise;” “And he remembered for them his covenant” (Psalm
106:45). He remembers and understands his covenant, therefore his promise to perform it, and therefore
our wants to supply them.
</p>
<p>
    3. And the rather, because God knows the persons of all his own. He hath in his infinite
understanding, the exact number of all the individual persons that belong to him (2 Tim. 2:19): “The Lord
knows them that are his.” He knows all things, because he hath created them; and he knows his people
because he hath not only made them, but also chose them; he could no more choose he knew not what,
than he could create he knew not what; and he knows them under a double title; of creation as creatures,
in the common mass of creation; as new creatures by a particular act of separation. He cannot be ignorant
of them in time, whom he foreknew from eternity; his knowledge in time is the same he had from
eternity; he foreknew them that he intended to give the grace of faith unto; and he knows them after they
believe, because he knows his own act, in bestowing grace upon them, and his own mark and seal
wherewith he hath stamped them. No doubt but he that “calls the stars of heaven by their names” (Psalm
147:4), knows the number of those living stars that sparkle in the firmament of his church. He cannot be
ignorant of their persons, when he numbers the hairs of their heads, and hath registered their names in the
book of life. As he only had an infinite mercy to make the choice, so he only hath an infinite
understanding to comprehend their persons. We only know the elect of God by a moral assurance in the
judgment of charity, when the conversation of men is according to the doctrine of God. We have not an
infallible knowledge of them, we may be often mistaken; Judas, a devil, may be judged by man for a
saint, till he be stripped of his disguise. God only hath an infallible knowledge of them, he knows his own
records, and the counterparts in the hearts of his people; none can counterfeit his seal, nor can any rase it
out. When the church is either scattered like dust by persecution, or overgrown with superstition and
idolatry, that there is scarce any grain of true religion appearing, as in the time of Elijah, who complained
that he was left alone, as if the church had been rooted out of that corner of the world (1 Kings 19:14, 18);
yet God knew that he had a number fed in a cave, and had reserved seven thousand men that had
preserved the purity of his worship, and not bowed their knee to Baal.754 Christ knew his sheep, as well as
he is known of them; yea, better than they can know him (John 10:14). History acquaints us, that Cyrus
had so vast a memory, that he knew the name of every particular soldier in his army, which consisted of
divers nations; shall it be too hard for an infinite understanding to know every one of that host that march
under his banners? may he not as well know them, as know the number, qualities, influences, of those
stars which lie concealed from our eye, as well as those that are visible to our sense?
</p>
<p>
     Yes, he knows them, as a general to employ them, as a shepherd to preserve them; he knows them in
the world to guard them, and he knows them when they are out of the world to gather them, and cull out
their bodies, though wrapped up in a cloud of the putrified carcases of the wicked. As he knew them from
all eternity to elect them, so he knows them in time to clothe their persons with righteousness, to protect
their persons in calamity, according to his good pleasure, and at last to raise and reward them according to
his promise.
</p>
<p>
     4. We may take comfort from hence, that our sincerity cannot be unknown to an infinite
understanding. Not a way of the righteous is concealed from him, and, therefore, “they shall stand in
judgment before him” (Psalm 1:6): “The Lord knows the way of the righteous;” he knows them to
observe them, and he knows them to reward them. How comfortable is it to appeal to this attribute of God
for our integrity, with Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:3)! “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before thee in
truth, and with a perfect heart.” Christ himself is brought in in this prophetical psalm, drawing out the
comfort of this attribute (Psalm 40:9): “I have not restrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest;” meaning his
faithfulness in declaring the righteousness of God. Job follows the same steps, “Also now behold, my
record is in heaven, and my witness is on high” (Job 16:19); my innocence hath the testimony of men, but
my greatest support is in the records of God. Also now, or, besides the testimony of my own heart, I have
another witness in heaven, that knows the heart, and can only judge of the principles of my actions, and
clear me from the scorns of my friends and the accusations of men, with a justification of my innocence;
he repeats it twice, to take the greater comfort in it. God knows that we do that in the simplicity of our
hearts, which may be judged by men to be done for unworthy and sordid ends: he knows not only the
outward action, but the inward affection, and praises that which men often dispraise, and writes down that
with an Euge! “Well done, good and faithful servant,” which men daub with their severest censures (Rom.
2:29). How refreshing is it to consider, that God never mistakes the appearance for reality, nor is led by
the judgment of man! He sits in heaven, and laughs at their follies and censures. If God had no sounder
and no more piercing a judgment than man, woe be to the sincerest souls that are often judged hypocrites
by some. What a happiness is it for integrity to have a judge of infinite understanding, who will one day
wipe off the dirt of worldly reproaches! Again, God knows the least dram of grace and righteousness in
the hearts of his people, though but as a smoking flax, or the least bruise of a saving conviction (Matt.
12:20), and knows it so as to cherish it; he knows that work he hath begun, and never hath his eye off
from it to abandon it.
</p>
<p>
     5. The consideration of this excellent perfection in God may comfort us in our secret prayers, sighs,
and works. If God were not of infinite understanding to pierce into the heart, what comfort hath a poor
creature that hath a scantiness of expressions but a heart in a flame? If God did not understand the heart,
faith and prayer, which are eternal works, would be in vain. How could he give that mercy our hearts
plead for if he were ignorant of our inward affections? Hypocrites might scale heaven by lofty
expressions, and a sincere soul come short of the happiness he is prepared for, for want of flourishing
gifts. Prayer is an eternal work; words are but the garment of prayer; meditation is the body, and affection
the soul and life of prayer; “Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation” (Psalm 5:1). Prayer
is a rational act; an act of the mind. not the act of a parrot: prayer is an act of the heart, though the
speaking prayer is the work of the tongue; now God gives ear to the words, but he considers the
meditation of the frame of the heart. Consideration is a more exact notice than hearing; the act only of the
ear. Were not God of an infinite understanding, and omniscient, he might take fine clothes, a heap of
garments, for the man himself, and be put off by glittering words, without a spiritual frame. What matter
of rejoicing is it that we call not upon a deaf and ignorant idol, but on one that listens to our secret
petitions, to give them a dispatch, that knows our desires afar off, and from the infiniteness of his mercy,
joined with his omniscience, stands ready to give us a return? Hath he not a book of remembrance for
them that fear him, and for their sighs and ejaculations to him, as well as their discourses of him, (Mal.
3:16); and not only what prayers they utter, but what gracious and holy thoughts they have of him that
thought upon his name? Though millions of supplications be put up at the same time, yet they have all a
distinct file (as I may say) in an infinite understanding, which perceives and comprehends them all. As he
observes millions of sins committed at the same time, by a vast number of persons, to record them in
order to punishment, so he distinctly discerns an infinite number of cries, at the same moment, to register
them in order to an answer. A sigh cannot escape an infinite understanding, though crowded among a
mighty multitude of cries from others, or covered with many unwelcome distractions in ourselves, no
more than a believing touch from the woman that had the bloody issue could be concealed from Christ,
and be undiscerned from the press of the thronging multitudes: our groans are as audible and intelligible
to him as our words, and he knows what is the mind of his own Spirit, though expressed in no plainer
language than sobs and heavings (Rom. 8:27). Thus David cheers up himself under the neglects of his
friends (Psalm 38:9); “Lord, my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.” Not a groan
of a panting spirit shall be lost, till God hath lost his knowledge; not a petition forgotten while God hath a
record, nor a tear dried while God hath a bottle to reserve it in (Psalm 6:8). Our secret works are also
known and observed by him; not only our outward labor, but our inward love in it (Heb. 6:10). If, with
Isaac, we go privately into the field to meditate, or secretly “cast our bread upon the waters,” he keeps his
eye upon us to reward us, and returns the fruit into our own bosoms (Matt. 6:4, 6); yea, though it be but a
cup of cold water, from an inward spring of love, given to a disciple, “He sees your works, and your
labor, and faith, and patience” in working them (Rev. 2:2); all the marks of your industry, and strength of
your intentions, and will be as exact at last, in order to a due praise, as to open sins, in order to a just
recompense (1 Cor. 4:5).
</p>
<p>
     6. The consideration of this excellent attribute affords comfort in the afictions of good men. He knows
their pressures, as well as hears their cries (Exod. 3:7). His knowledge comes not by information from us;
but his compassionate listening to our cries springs from his own inspection into our sorrows; he is
affected with them, before we make any discovery of them; he is not ignorant of the best season, when
they may be usefully inflicted, and when they may be profitaby removed. The tribulation and poverty of
his church is not unknown to him (Rev. 2:8, 9); “I know thy works and tribulation,” &amp;c. He knows their
works, and what tribulation they meet with for him; he sees their extremities, when they are toiling
against the wind and tide of the world (Mark 6:48); yea, the natural exigencies of the multitude are not
neglected by him; he discerns to take care of them. Our Saviour considered the three days’ fasting of his
followers, and miraculously provides a dish for them in the wilderness. No good man is ever out of God’s
mind, and therefore never out of his compassionate care: his eye pierceth into their dungeons, and pities
their miseries. Joseph may forget his brethren, and the disciples not know Christ, when he walks upon the
midnight waves and turbulent sea,755 but a lion’s den cannot obscure a Daniel from his sight, nor the
depths of the whale’s belly bury Jonah from the Divine understanding: he discerns Peter in his chains, and
Stephen under the stones of martyrdom; he knows Lazarus under his tattered rags, and Abel wallowing in
his blood; his eye and knowledge goes along with his people, when they are transplanted into foreign
countries, and sold for slaves into the islands of the Grecian, “for he will raise them out of the place” (Joel
3:6, 7). He would defeat the hopes of the persecutors, and applaud the patience of his people. He knows
his people in the tabernacle of life, and in the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23). He knows all
penal evils, because he commissions and directs them. He knows the instruments, because they are his
sword (Psalm 17:13); and he knows his gracious sufferer because he hath his mark. He discerns Job in his
anguish, and the devil in his malice. By the direction of this attribute he orders calamities, and rescues
from them. “Thou hast seen it, for thou beholdest mischief and spite” (Psalm 10:14). That is the comfort
of the psalmist, and the comfbrt of every believer, and the ground of committing themselves to God under
all the injustice of men.
</p>
<p>
     7. It is a comfort in all our infirmities. As he knows our sins to charge them, so he knows the
weakness of our nature to pity us. As his infinite understanding may scare us, because he knows our
transgressions, so it may relieve us, because he knows our natural mutability in our first creation, “he
knows our frame, he remembers that we are dust” (Psalm 103:14). ’Tis the reason of the precedent verses
why he removes our transgression from us, why he is so backward in punishing, so patient in waiting, so
forward in pitying; Why? He doth not only remember our sins, but remember our frame of forming; what
brittle, though clear glasses we were by creation, how easy to be cracked! He remembers our impotent
and weak condition by corruption; what a sink we have of vain imaginations that remain in us after
regeneration; he doth not only consider that we were made according to his image, and therefore able to
stand, but that we were made of dust and weak matter, and had a sensitive soul, like that of beasts, as well
as an intellectual nature, like that of angels, and therefore liable to follow the dictates of it, without exact
care and watchfulness. If he remembered only the first, there would be no issue but indignation; but the
consideration of the latter moves his compassion. How miserable should we be for want of this perfection
in the Divine nature, whereby God remembers and reflects upon his past act in our first frame, and the
mindfulness of our condition excites the motion of his bowels to us! Had he lost the knowledge how he
first framed us, did he not still remember the mutability of our nature, as we were formed and stamped in
his mint, how much more wretched would our condition be than it is! If his remembrance of our original
be one ground of his pity, the sense of his omniscience should be a ground of our comfort in the stirring
of our infirmities: he remembers we were but dust when he made us, and yet remembers we are but dust
while he preserves and forbears us.
</p>
<p>
     8. It is some comfort in the fears of some lurking corruption in our hearts. We know by this whither to
address ourselves for the search and discovery of it: perhaps some blessings we want are retarded; some
calamities we understand not the particular cause of, are inflicted; some petitions we have put up, hang
too long for an answer; and the chariot wheels of Divine goodness move slow, and are long in coming.
Let us beg the aid of this attribute to open to us the remoras, to discover what base affection there is that
retards the mercies we want, or attracts the affliction we feel, or bars the door against the return of our
supplications. What our dim sight cannot discover, the clear eye of God can make visible to us (Job 10:2):
“Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.” As in want of pardon, we particularly plead his mercy,
and in our desires for the performance of his promise, we argue with him from his faithfulness, so in the
fear of any insincerity or hidden corruption we should implore his omniscience: for as God is a God in
covenant, our God, our God in the whole of his nature, so the perfections of his nature are employed in
their several stations, as assistances of his creatures. This was David’s practice and comfort, after that
large meditation, on the omniscience and omnipresence of God, he turns his thoughts of it into petitions
for the employment of it in the concerns of his soul, and begs a mercy suitable to the glory of this
perfection (Psalm 139:23): “Search me, O God, and try my heart, try me, and know my thoughts;” dive to
the bottom (ver. 24), “and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.” His
desire is not barely that God should know him, for it would be senseless to beg of God that he should
have mercy, or faithfulness, or power, or knowledge in his nature; but he desires the exercise of this
attribute, in the discovery of himself to himself, in order to his sight of any wicked way, and humiliation
for it, and reformation of it, in order to his conduct to everlasting life. As we may appeal to this perfection
to judge us when the sincerity of our actions is censured by others, so we may implore it to search us
when our sincerity is questioned by ourselves, that our minds may be enlightened by a beam from his
knowledge, and the little thieves may be pulled out of their dens in our hearts by the hand of his power. In
particular, it is our comfort that we can, and our necessity that we must address particularly to this, when
we engage solemnly in a work of self-examination; that we may have a clearer eye to direct us than our
own, that we may not mistake brass for gold, or counterfeit graces for true; that nothing that is filthy and
fit to be cast out, may escape our sight, and preserve its station. And we need not question the laying at
the door of this neglect (viz. not calling in this attribute to our aid, whose proper office it is, as I may so
say, to search and inquire) all the mistakes, ill success, and fruitlessness of our endeavors in self-
examination, because we would engage in it in the pitiful strength of our own dimness, and not in the light
of God’s countenance, and the assistance of his eye, which can discern what we cannot see, and discover
that to us which we cannot manifest to ourselves. It is a comfort to a learner of an art to have a skilful eye
to overlook his work, and inform him of the defects. Beg the help of the eye of God in all your searches
and self-examinations.
</p>
<p>
     9. The consideration of this attribute is comfortable in our assurances of, and reflections upon, the
pardon of sin, or seeking of it. As God punishes men for sin according to his knowledge of them, which is
greater than the knowledge their own consciences have of them, so he pardons according to his
knowledge: he pardons not only according to our knowledge, but according to his own; he is greater than
any man’s heart, to condemn for that which a man is at present ignorant of; and greater than our hearts, to
pardon that which is not at present visible to us; he knows that which the most watchful conscience
cannot take a survey of: if God had not an infinite understanding of us, how could we have a perfect and
full pardon from him? It would not stand with his honor to pardon he knew not what. He knows what
crimes we have to be pardoned, when we know not all of them ourselves, that stand in need of a gracious
remission; his omniscience beholds every sin to charge it upon our Saviour. If he knows our sins that are
black, he knows every mite of Christ’s righteousness which is pure, and the utmost extent of his merits, as
well as the demerit of our iniquities. As he knows the filth of our sin, he also knows the covering of our
Saviour: he knows the value of the Redeemer’s sufferings, and exactly understands every plea in the
intercession of our Advoeate. Though God knows our sins oculo indice, yet he doth not see them oculo
judice, with a judicial eye: his omniscience stirs not up his justice to revenge, but his mercy to pity. His
infinite understanding of what Christ hath done, directs him to disarm his justice, and sound an alarm to
his bowels. As he understands better than we what we have committed, so he understands better than we
what our Saviour hath merited; and his eye directs his hand in the blotting out guilt, and applying the
remedy.
</p>
<p>
     Use III. shall be to sinners, to humble them, and put them upon serious consideration. This attribute
speaks terrible things to a profligate sinner. Basil thinks that the ripping open the sins of the damned to
their faces by this perfection of God, is more terrible than their other torments in hell. God knows the
persons of wicked men, not one is exempted from his eye; he sees all the actions of men, as well as he
knows their persons (Job 11:11): “He knows vain men, he sees wickedness also” (Job 34:21): “His eye is
upon all their goings.” He hears the most private whispers (Psalm 139:4), the scope, manner,
circumstance of speaking, he knows it altogether: he understands all our thoughts, the first bubblings of
that bitter spring (Psalm 139:2); the quickest glances of the fancy, the closest musings of the mind, and
the abortive wouldings or wishes of the will, the language of the heart, as well as the language of the
tongue; not a foolish thought, or an idle word, not a wanton glance, or a dishonest action, not a negligent
service, or a distracting fancy, but is more visible to him, than the filth of a dunghill can be to any man by
the help of a sun beam. How much better would it be for desperate sinners to have their crimes known to
all the angels in heaven, and men upon earth, and devils in hell, than that they should be known to their
Sovereign, whose laws they have violated, and to their Judge, whose righteousness obligcth him to
revenge the injury!
</p>
<p>
     1. Consider what a poor refuge is secrecy to a sinner. Not the mists of a foggy day, nor the obscurity
of the darkest night, not the closest curtains, nor the deepest dungeon, can hide any sin from the eye of
God. Adam is known in his thickets, and Jonah in his cabin. Achan’s wedge of gold is discerned by him,
though buried in the earth, and hooded with a tent. Shall Sarah be unseen by him, when she mockingly
laughs behind the door? Shall Gehazi tell a lie, and comfort himself with an imagination of his master’s
ignorance, as long as God knows it? Whatsoever works men do, are not hid from God, whether done in
the darkness or daylight, in the midnight darkness, or the noon-day sun: he is all eye to see, and he hath a
great wrath to punish. The wheels of Ezekiel are full of eyes: a piercing eye to behold the sinner, and a
swift wheel of wrath to overtake him. God is light, and of all things light is most difficultly kept out. The
secretest sins are set in the light of his countenance (Psalm 90:8), as legible to him, as if written with a
sun-beam; more visible to him than the greatest print to the sharpest eye. The fornications of the
Samaritan woman, perhaps known only to her own conscience, were manifest to Christ (John 4:16.) There
is nothing so secretly done, but there is an infallible witness to prepare a charge. Though God be invisible
to us, we must not imagine we are so to him; it is a vanity, therefore, to think that we can conceal
ourselves from God, by concealing the notions of God from our sense and practice. If men be as close
from the eyes of all men, as from those of the sun, yea, if they could separate themselves from their own
shadow, they could not draw themselves from God’s understanding: how, then, can darkness shelter us, or
crafty artifices defend us? With what shame will sinners be filled, when God, who hath traced their steps,
and writ their sins in a book, shall make a repetition of their ways, and unveil the web of their
wickedness!
</p>
<p>
     2. What a dreadful consideration is this to the juggling hypocrite, that masks himself with an
appearance of piety? An infinite understanding judges not according to veils and shadows, but according
to truth; “He judges not according to appearance” (1 Sam. 16:7). The outward comeliness of a work
imposeth not on him, his knowledge, and therefore his estimations are quite of another nature than those
of men. By this perfection God looks through the veil, and beholds the litter of abominations in the secrets
of the soul; the true quality and principle of every work, and judges of them as they are, and not as they
appear. Disguised pretexts cannot deceive him; the disguises are known afar off, before they are weaved;
he pierceth into the depths of the most abstruse wills; all secret ends are dissected before him; every
action is naked in its outside, and open in its inside; all are as clear to him as if their bodies were of
crystal; so that if there be any secret reserves, he will certainly reprove us (Job 13:10). We are often
deceived; we may take wolves for sheep, and hypocrites for believers; for the eyes of men are no better
than flesh, and dive no further than appearance; but an infinite understanding, that fathoms the secret
depths of the heart, is too knowing to let a dream pass for a truth, or mistake a shadow for a body. Though
we call God Father all our days, speak the language of angels, or be endowed with the gifts of miracles,
he can discern whether we have his mark upon us; he can espy the treason of Judas in a kiss; Herod’s
intent of murdering under a specious pretence of worship; a Pharisee’s fraud under a broad phylactery; a
ravenous wolf under the softness of a sheep’s skin; and the devil in Samuel’s mantle, or when he would
shroud himself among the sons of God (Job 1:6, 7). All the rooms of the heart, and every atom of dust in
the least chink of it, is clear to his eye; he can strip sin from the fairest excuses, pierce into the heart with
more ease than the sun can through the thinnest cloud or vapor; and look through all Ephraim’s ingenuous
inventions to excuse his idolatry (Hos. 5:3). Hypocrisy, then, is a senseless thing, since it cannot escape
unmasking, by an infinite understanding. As all our force cannot stop his arm, when he is resolved to
punish, so all our sophistry cannot blind his understanding, when he comes to judge. Woe to the
hypocrite, for God sees him; all his juggling is open and naked to infinite understanding.
</p>
<p>
     3. Is it not also a senseless thing to be careless of sins committed long ago? The old sins forgotten by
men, stick fast in an infinite understanding: time cannot rase out that which hath been known from
eternity. Why should they be forgotten many years after they were acted, since they were foreknown in an
eternity before they were committed, or the criminal capable to practise them? Amalek must pay their
arrears of their ancient unkindness to Israel in the time of Saul, though the generation that committed
them were rotten in their graves (1 Sam. 15:2). Old sins are written in a book, which lies always before
God; and not only our own sins, but the sins of our fathers, to be requited upon their posterity.756 What a
vanity is it then to be regardless of the sins of an age that went before us! because they are in some
measure out of our knowledge, are they therefore blotted out of God’s remembrance? Sins are bound up
with him, as men do bonds, till they resolve to sue for the debt; the iniquity of Ephraim is bound up (Hos.
13:12). As his foreknowledge extends to all acts that shall be done, so his remembrance extends to all acts
that have been done, We may as well say, God foreknows nothing that shall be done to the end of the
world, as that he forgets anything that hath been done from the beginning of the world. The former ages
of the world are no further distant from him than the latter. God hath a calendar (as it were) or an account
book of men’s sins ever since the beginning of the world, what they did in their childhood, what in their
youth, what in their manhood, and what in their old age: he hath them in store among his treasures (Deut.
32:34): he hath neither lost his understanding to know them, nor his resolution to revenge them as it
follows, “to me vengeance belongs” (ver. 35). He intends to enrich his justice with a glorious
manifestation, by rendering a due recompense. And it is to be observed, that God doth not only
necessarily remember them, but sometimes binds himself by an oath to do it (Amos 8:7); “The Lord hath
sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.” Or, in the Hebrew, “If I
ever forget any of their works;” that is, let me not be accounted a God forever, if I do forget; let me lose
my godhead, if I lose my remembrance. It is not less a misery to the wicked, than it is a comfort to the
godly, that their record is in heaven.
</p>
<p>
    4. Let it be observed, that this infinite understanding doth exactly know the sins of men; he knows so
as to consider. He doth not only know them, but intently behold them (Psalm 11:4): “His eyelids try the
children of men,” a metaphor taken from men that contract the eyelids, when they would wistly and
accurately behold a thing; it is not a transient and careless look (Psalm 10:14): “Thou hast seen it;” thou
hast intently beheld it, as the word properly signifies: he beholds and knows the actions of every
particular man, as if there were none but he in the world; and doth not only know, but ponder (Prov.
5:21), and consider their works (Psalm 33:15); he is not a bare spectator, but a diligent observer (1 Sam.
2:3); “By him actions are weighed:” to see what degree of good or evil there is in them, what there is to
blemish them, what to advantage them, what the quality and quantity of every action is. Consideration
takes in every circumstance of the considered object: notice is taken of the place where, the minute when,
the mercy against which it is committed; the number of them is exact in God’s book: “They have tempted
me now these ten times” (Numb. 14:22), against the demonstrations of my glory in Egypt and the
wilderness. The whole guilt in every circumstance is spread before him: his knowledge of men’s sins is
not confused; such an imperfection an infinite understanding cannot be subject to: it is exact, for iniquity
is marked before him (Jer. 2:22).
</p>
<p>
    5. God knows men’s miscarriage so as to judge. This use his omniscience is put to, to maintain his
sovereign authority in the exercise of his justice. His notice of the sins of men is in order to a just
retribution (Psalm 10:14): “Thou hast seen mischief to requite it with thy hand.” The eye of his
knowledge directs the hand of his justice; and no sinful action that falls under his cognizance, but will fall
under his revenge; they can as little escape his censure as they can his knowledge: he is a witness in his
omniscience, that he may be a judge in his righteousness; he knows the hearts of the wicked, so as to hate
their works, and testify his abhorrency of that which is of high value with men (Luke 16:15). Sin is not
preserved in his understanding, or written down in his book to be moth-eaten as an old manuscript, but to
be opened one day, and copied out in the consciences of men: he writes them to publish them, and sets
them in the light of his countenance, to bring them to the light of their consciences. What a terrible
consideration is it, to think that the sins of a day are upon record in an infallible understanding, much
more the sins of a week; what a number, then, do the sins of a month, a year, ten or forty years, arise to!
How many actions against charity, against sincerity! what an infinite number is there of them, all bound
up in the court rolls of God’s omniscience, in order to a trial, to be brought out before the eyes of men!
Who can seriously consider all those bonds, reserved in the cabinet of God’s knowledge, to be sued out
against the sinner in due time, without an inexpressible horror?
</p>
<p>
    Use IV. is of exhortation. Let us have a sense of God’s knowledge upon our hearts. All wickedness
hath a spring from a want of due consideration and sense of it. David concludes it so (Psalm 86:14), “the
proud rose against him, and violent men sought after his son, because they did not set God before them,”
They think God doth not know, and therefore care not what, nor how they act. When the fear of this
attribute is removed, a door is opened to all impiety. What is there so villanous, but the minds of men will
attempt to act? What reverence of a Deity can be left, when the sense of his infinite understanding is
extinguished? What faith could there be in judgments in witnesses? How would the foundations of human
society be overturned; the pillars upon which commerce stands, be utterly broken and dissolved! What
society can be preserved, if this be not truly believed, and faithfully stuck to! But how easily would oaths
be swallowed and quickly violated, if the sense of this perfection were rooted out of the minds of men!
What fear could they have of calling to witness a Being they imagine blind and ignorant? Men secretly
imagine, that God knows not, or soon forgets, and then make bold to sin against him (Ezek. 8:12). How
much does it therefore concern us to cherish and keep alive the sense of this? “If God writes us upon the
palms of his hands,” as the expression is, to remember us, let us engrave him upon the tables of our hearts
to remember him. It would be a good motto to write upon our minds, God knows all, he is of infinite
understanding.
</p>
<p>
     1. This would give check to much iniquity. Can a man’s conscience easily and delightfully swallow
that which he is sensible falls under the cognizance of God, when it is hateful to the eyes of his holiness,
and renders the actor odious to him? “Doth he not see my ways, and count all my steps,” saith Job (31:4)?
To what end doth he fix this consideration? To keep him from wanton glances; temptations have no
encouragement to come near him, that is constantly armed with the thoughts that his sin is booked in
God’s omniscience. If any impudent devil hath the face to tempt us, we should not have the impudence to
join issue with him under the sense of an infinite understanding. How fruitless would his wiles be against
this consideration! How easily would his snares be cracked by one sensible thought of this! This doth
Solomon prescribe to allay the heat of carnal imaginations (Prov. 5:20, 21). It were a useful question to
ask, at the appearance of every temptation, at the entrance upon every action, as the church did in
temptations to idolatry (Psalm 44:21): “Shall not God search this out, for he knows the secrets of the
heart?” His understanding comprehends us more than our consciences can our acts, or our understanding
our thoughts. Who durst speak treason against a prince, if he were sure he heard him, or that it would
come to his knowledge? A sense of God’s knowledge of wickedness in the first motion, and inward
contrivance, would bar the accomplishment and execution. The consideration of God’s infinite
understanding would cry stand to the first glances of the heart to sin.
</p>
<p>
     2. It would make us watchful over our hearts and thoughts. Should we harbor any unworthy thoughts
in our cabinet, if our heads and hearts were possessed with this useful truth, that God knows everything
which comes into our minds (Ezek. 11:5)? We should as much blush at the rising of impure thoughts
before the understanding of God, as at the discovery of unworthy actions to the knowledge of men, if we
lived under a sense, that not a thought of all those millions, which flutter about our minds, can be
concealed from him. How watchful and careful should we be of our hearts and thoughts!
</p>
<p>
     3. It would be a good preparation to every duty. This consideration should be the preface to every
service; the Divine understanding knows how I now act. This would engage us to serious intention, and
quell wandering and distracting fancies. Who would come before God, with a careless and ignorant soul,
under a sense of his infinite understanding, and prerogative of searching the heart? “O thou that sittest in
heaven!” was a consideration the psalmist had at the beginning of his prayer (Psalm 123:1?): whereby he
testifies not only an apprehension of the majesty and power of God, but of his omniscience; as one sitting
above, beholds all that is below; would we offer to God such raw and undigested petitions? would there
be so much flatness in our services? should our hearts so often give us the slip? would any hang down
their heads like a bulrush, by an affected or counterfeit humility, while the heart is filled with pride, if we
did actuate faith in this attribute? No; our prayers would be more sound, our devotions more vigorous, our
hearts more close, our sprits like the chariots of Aminadab, more swift in their motions: everything would
be done by us with all our might, which would be very feeble and faint, if we conceived God to be of a
finite understanding like ourselves. Let us therefore, before every duty, not draw, but open the curtains
between God and our souls, and think that we are going before him that sees us, before him that knows us
(Gen. 1:12). And the stronger impressions of the Divine knowledge are upon our minds, the better would
our preparation be for, and the more active our frames in every service: and certainly we may judge of the
suitableness of our preparations, by the strength of such impressions upon us.
</p>
<p>
     4. This would tend to make us sincere in our whole course. This prescription David gave to Solomon,
to maintain a soundness and health of spirit in his walk before God (1 Chron. 28:9): “And thou, Solomon,
my son, know the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart, for the Lord understands all the
imaginations of the thoughts.” Josephus gives this reason for Abel’s holiness, that he believed God was
ignorant of nothing.757 As the doctrine of omniscience is the foundation of all religion, so the impression
of it would promote the practice of all religion. When all our ways are imagined by us to be before the
Lord, we shall then keep his precepts (Psalm 119:168). And we can never be perfect or sincere till we
“walk before God” (Gen. 17:1); as under the eye of God’s knowledge. What we speak, what we think,
what we act, is in his sight; he knows every place where we are, everything that we do, as well as Christ
knew Nathaniel under the fig-tree. As he is too powerful to be vanquished, so he is too understanding to
be deceived; the sense of this would make us walk with as much care, as if the understanding of all men
did comprehend us and our actions.
</p>
<p>
     5. The consideration of this attribute would make us humble. How dejected would a person be if he
were sure all the angels in heaven and men upon on earth, did perfectly know his crimes, with all their
aggravations! But what is created knowledge to an infinite and just censuring understanding! When we
consider that he knows our actions, whereof there are multitudes, and our thoughts, whereof there are
millions; that he views all the blessings bestowed upon us; all the injuries we have returned to him; that he
exactly knows his own bounty, and our ingratitude; all the idolatry, blasphemy, and secret enmity in every
man’s heart against him; all tyrannical oppressions, hidden lusts, omissions of necessary duties, violations
of plain precepts, every foolish imagination, with all the circumstances of them, and that perfectly in their
full anatomy, every mite of unworthiness and wickedness in every circumstance; and add to this his
knowledge, the wonders of his patience, which are miraculous upon the score of his omniscience, that he
is not as quick in his revenge as he is in his understanding, but is so far from inflicting punishment, that he
continues his former benefits, arms not his justice against us, but solicits our repentance, and. waits to be
gracious with all this knowledge of our crimes; should not the consideration of this melt our hearts into
humiliation before him, and make us earnest in begging pardon and forgiveness of him? Again, do we not
all find a worm in our best fruit, a flaw in our soundest duties? Shall any of us vaunt, as if God beheld
only the gold, and not any dross; as if he knew one thing only, and not another? If we knew something by
ourselves to cheer us, do we not also know something, yea, many things, to condemn us, and therefore to
humble us? Let the sense of God’s infinite knowledge, therefore, be an incentive and argument for more
humiliation in us. If we know enough to render ourselves vile in our own eyes, how much more doth God
know to render us vile in his!
</p>
<p>
     6. The consideration of this excellent perfection should make us to acquiesce in God, and rely upon
him in every strait. In public, in private; he knows all cases, and he knows all remedies; he knows the
seasons of bringing them, and he knows the seasons of removing them, for his own glory. What is
contingent in respect of us, and of our foreknowledge, and in respect of second causes, is not so in regard
of God’s, who hath the knowledge of the futurition of all things; he knows all causes in themselves, and,
therefore, knows what every cause will produce, what will be the event of every counsel and of every
action. How should we commit ourselves to this God of infinite understanding, who knows all things, and
foreknows everything; that cannot be forced through ignorance to take new counsel, or be surprised with
anything that can happen to us! This use the Psalmist makes of it (Psalm 10:14): “Thou hast seen it, the
poor committeth himself unto thee.” Though “some trust in chariots and horses” (Psalm 20:7), some in
counsels and counsellors, some in their arms and courage, and some in mere vanity and nothing; yet, let
us remember the name and nature of the Lord our God, his divine perfections, of which this of his infinite
understanding and omniscience is none of the least, but so necessary, that without it he could not be God,
and the whole world would be a mere chaos and confusion.

<h1 class="caption"> DISCOURSE IX - ON THE WISDOM OF GOD</h1>
<blockquote>
To God only wise be glory, through Jesus Christ, for ever. Amen.
<div class="sig">ROM. 16:27</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
     THIS chapter being the last of this Epistle, is chiefly made up of charitable and friendly salutations
and commendations of particular persons, according to the earliness and strength of their several graces,
and their labor of love for the interest of God and his people. In verse 17, he warns them not to be drawn
aside from the gospel doctrine, which had been taught them, by the plausible pretences and insinuations
which the corrupters of the doctrine and rule of Christ never want from the suggestions of their carnal
wisdom. The brats of soul-destroying errors may walk about the world in a garb and disguise of good
words and fair speeches, as it is in the 18th. verse; by “good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
the simple.” And for their encouragement to a constancy in the gospel doctrine, he assures them, that all
those that would dispossess them of truth, to possess them with vanity, are but Satan’s instruments, and
will fall under the same captivity and yoke with their principal (ver. 18); “The God of peace shall bruise
Satan under your feet shortly.” Whence, observe,
</p>
<p>
     1. All corrupters of divine truth, and troublers of the church’s peace, are no better than devils. Our
Saviour thought the name, Satan, a title merited by Peter, when he breathed out an advice, as an axe at the
root of the gospel, the death of Christ, the foundation of all gospel truth; and the apostle concludes them
under the same character, which hinder the superstructure, and would mix their chaff with his wheat
(Matt. 16:23), “Get thee behind me, Satan.” It is not, Get thee behind me, Simon, or, Get thee behind me,
Peter; but “Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me.” Thou dost oppose thyself to the
wisdom, and grace, and authority of God, to the redemption of man, and to the good of the world. As the
Holy Ghost is the Spirit of truth, so is Satan the spirit of falsehood as the Holy Ghost inspires believers
with truth, so doth the devil corrupt unbelievers with error. Let us cleave to the truth of the gospel, that we
may not be counted by God as part of the corporation of fallen angels, and not be barely reckoned as
enemies of God, but in league with the greatest enemy to his glory in the world.
</p>
<p>
     2. The Reconciler of the world will be the Subduer of Satan. The God of peace sent the Prince of
peace to be the restorer of his rights, and the hammer to beat in pieces the usurper of them. As a God of
truth, he will make good his promise; as a God of peace, he will perfect the design his wisdom hath laid,
and begun to act. In the subduing Satan, he will be the conqueror of his instruments: he saith not, God
shall bruise your troublers and heretics, but Satan: the fall of a general proves the rout of the army. Since
God, as a God of peace, hath delivered his own, he will perfect the victory, and make them cease from
bruising the heel of his spiritual seed.
</p>
<p>
     3. Divine evangelical truth shall be victorious. No weapon formed against I shall prosper: the head of
the wicked shall fall as low as the feet of the godly. The devil never yet blustered in the world, but he met
at last with a disappointment: his fall hath been like lightning, sudden, certain, vanishing.
</p>
<p>
     4. Faith must look back as far as the foundation promise. “The God of peace shall bruise,” &amp;c. The
apostle seems to allude to the first promise (Gen. 2:15),—a promise that hath vigor to nourish the church
in all ages of the world: it is the standing cordial; out of the womb of this promise all the rest have taken
their birth. The promises of the Old Testament were designed for those under the New, and the full
performance of them is to be expected, and will be enjoyed by them. It is a mighty strengthening to faith,
to trace the footsteps of God’s truth and wisdom, from the threatening against the serpent in Eden, to the
bruise he received in Calvary, and the triumph over him upon Mount Olivet.
</p>
<p>
     5. We are to confide in the promise of God, but leave the season of its accomplishment to his wisdom.
He will “bruise Satan under your feet,” therefore do not doubt it; and shortly, therefore, wait for it. Shortly
it will be done, that is, quickly, when you think it may be a great way off; or shortly, that is, seasonably,
when Satan’s rage is hottest. God is the best judge of the seasons of distributing his own mercies, and
darting out his own glory: it is enough to encourage our waiting, that it will be, and that it will be shortly;
but we must not measure God’s shortly by our minutes.
</p>
<p>
     The apostle after this, concludes with a comfortable prayer, that since they were liable to many
temptations to turn their backs apon the doctrine which they had learned; yet he desires God, who had
brought them to the knowledge of his truth, would confirm them in the belief of it, since it was the gospel
of Christ, his dear Son, and a mystery he bad been chary of and kept in his own cabinet, and now brought
forth to the world in pursuance of the ancient prophesies, and now had published to all nations for that
end that it might be obeyed; and concludes with a doxology, a voice of praise, to Him, who was only wise
to effect his own purposes (ver. 25, 26, 27), “Now to him that is of power to establish you according to
my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept
secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according
to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.” This
doxology is interlaced with many comforts for the Romans. He explains the causes of this glory to God,
power, and wisdom; power to establish the Romans in grace, which includes his will. This he proves from
a divine testimony, viz., the gospel; the gospel committed to him, and preached by him, which he
commends, by calling it the preaching of Christ; and describes it, for the instruction and comfort of the
church from the adjuncts, the obscurity of it under the Old Testament, and the clearness of it under the
New. It was hid from the former ages, and kept in silence; not simply and absolutely, but comparatively
and in part; because in the Old Testament, the doctrine of salvation by Christ was confined to the limits of
Judea, preached only to the inhabitants of that country: to them he gave “his statutes and his judgments,
and dealt not so magnificently with any nation” (Psalm 147:19, 20); but now he causes it to spring with
greater majesty out of those narrow bounds, and spread its wings about the world. This manifestation of
the gospel he declares, 1. from the subject, All nations. 2. From the principal efficient cause of it, The
commandment and order of God. 3. The instrumental cause, The prophetic Scriptures. 4. From the end of
it, The obedience of faith.758
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 1. The glorious attributes of God bear a comfortable respect to believers. Power and wisdom
are here mentioned as two props of their faith; his power here includes his goodness. Power to help,
without will to assist, is a dry chip. The apostle mentions not God’s power simply and absolutely
considered, for that of itself is no more comfort to men, then it is to devils; but, as considered in the
gospel covenant, his power, as well as his other perfections, are ingredients in that cordial of God’s being
our God. We should never think of the excellencies of the Divine nature, without considering the duties
they demand, and gathering the honey they present.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 2. The stability of a gracious soul depends upon the wisdom as well as the power of God. It
would be a disrepute to the Almightiness of God if that should be totally vanquished which was
introduced by his mighty arm, and rooted in the soul by an irresistible grace. It would speak a want of
strength to maintain it, or a change of resolution, and so would be no honor to the wisdom of his first
design. It is no part of the wisdom of an artificer, to let a work wherein he determined to shew the
greatness of his skill, be dashed in pieces, when he hath power to preserve it. God designed every
gracious soul for a piece of his workmanship (Eph. 2:10). What, to have the skill of his grace defeated? If
any soul which he hath graciously conquered should be wrested from him, what could be thought but that
his power is enfeebled? If deserted by him, what could be imagined, but that he repented of his labor, and
altered his counsel, as if rashly undertaken? These Romans were rugged pieces, and lay in a filthy quarry,
when God came first to smooth them; for so the apostle represents them with the rest of the heathen
(Rom. 1:19); and would he throw them away, or leave them to the power of his enemy, after all his pains
he had taken with them to fit them for his building? Did he not foresee the designs of Satan against them,
what stratagems he would use to defeat his purposes and strip him of the honor of his work; and would
God so gratify his enemy, and disgrace his own wisdom? The deserting of what hath been acted is a real
repentance, and argues an imprudence in the first resolve and attempt. The gospel is called the manifold
wisdom of God (Eph. 3:10); the fruit of it, in the heart of any person, which is a main design of it, hath a
title to the same character; and shall this grace, which is the product of this gospel, and therefore the birth
of manifold wisdom, be suppressed? It is at God’s hand we must seek our fixedness and establishment,
and act faith upon these two attributes of God. Power is no ground to expect stability, without wisdom
interesting the agent in it, and finding out and applying the means for it. Wisdom is naked without power
to act, and power is useless without wisdom to direct. They are these two excellencies of the Deity the
apostle here pitches the hope and faith of the converted Romans upon for their stability.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 3. Perseverance of believers in grace is a gospel doctrine. “According to my gospel,” my
gospel ministerially, according to that gospel doctrine I have taught you in this epistle (for, as the prophets
were comments upon the law, so are the epistles upon the gospel), this very doctrine he had discoursed of
(Rom. 8:38, 39), where he tells them, that neither death nor life, the terrors of a cruel death, or the
allurements of an honorable and pleasant life, nor principalities and powers, with all their subtelty and
strength, nor the things we have before us, nor the promises of a future felicity, by either angels in heaven
or devils in hell, not the highest angel, nor the deepest devil, is able to separate us, us Romans, “from the
love of God which is in Christ Jesus.” So that, according to my gospel, may be according to that
declaration of the gospel, which I have made in this epistle, which doth not only promise the first creating
grace, but the perfecting and crowning grace; for not only the being of grace, but the health, liveness, and
perpetuity of grace is the fruit of the new covenant (Jer.32:40.)
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 4. That the gospel is the sole means of a Christian’s establishment; “According to my gospel,”
that is, by my gospel. The gospel is the instrumental cause of our spiritual life; it is the cause also of the
continuance of it; it is the seed whereby we were born, and the milk whereby we are nourished (1 Pet.
1:23); it is the “power of God to salvation” (1 Pet. 2:2), and therefore to all the degrees of it (John 17:17);
“Sanctify them by tby truth,” or through thy truth; by or through his truth he sanctifies us, and by the
same truth he establisheth us. The first sanctification, and the progress of it, the first lineaments, and the
last colors, are wrought by the gospel. The gospel, therefore, ought to be known, studied, and considered
by us. It is the charter of our inheritance, and the security for our standing. The law acquaints us with our
duty, but contributes nothing to our strength and settlement.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 5. The gospel is nothing else but the revelation of Christ (ver. 25); “According to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ;” the discovery of the mystery of redemption and salvation in and by
him. It is genitivus objecti, that preaching wherein Christ is declared and set out, with the benefits
accruing by him. This is the privilege, the wisdom of God reserved for the latter times, which the Old
Testament church had only under a veil.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 6. It is a part of the excellency of the gospel that it had the Son of God for its publisher: “The
preaching of Jesus Christ.” It was first preached to Adam, in Paradise, by God; and afterwards published
by Christ in person, to the inhabitants of Judea. It was not the invention of man, but copied from the
bosom of the Father by him that lay in his bosom. The gospel we have, is the same which our Saviour
himself preached when he was in the world: he preached it not to the Romans, but the same gospel he
preached is transmitted to the Romans. It, therefore, commands our respect; whoever slights it, it is as
much as if he slighted Jesus Christ himself, were he in person to sound it from his own lips. The validity
of a proclamation is derived from the authority of the prince that dictates it and orders it; yet the greater
the person that publisheth it, the more dishonor is cast upon the authority of the prince that enjoins it, if it
be contemned. The everlasting God ordained it, and the eternal Son published it.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 7. The gospel was of an eternal resolution, though of a temporary revelation (ver. 25);
“According to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began.” It is an
everlasting gospel; it was a promise “before the world began” (Titus 1:2.) It was not a new invention, but
only kept secret among the arcana, in the breast of the Almighty. It was hidden from angels, for the depths
of it are not yet fully made known to them; their desire to look into it, speaks yet a deficiency in their
knowledge of it (1 Peter 1:12.) It was published in paradise, but in such words as Adam did not fully
understand: it was both discovered and clouded in the smoke of sacrifices: it was wrapped up in a veil
under the law, but not opened till the death of the Redeemer: it was then plainly said to the cities of Judah,
“Behold! your God comes!” The whole transaction of it between the Father and the Son, which is the
spirit of the gospel, was from eternity; the creation of the world was in order to the manifestation of it. Let
us not, then, regard the gospel as a novelty; the consideration of it, as one of God’s cabinet rarities, should
enhance our estimation of it. No traditions of men, no inventions of vain wits, that pretend to be wiser
than God, should have the same credit with that which bears date from eternity.
</p>
<p>
     Observ. 8. That divine truth is mysterious; “According to the revelation of the mystery, Christ
manifested in the flesh.” The whole scheme of godliness is a mystery. No man or angel could imagine
how two natures so distant as the Divine and human should be united; how the same person should be
criminal and righteous; how a just God should have a satisfaction, and sinful man a justification; how the
sin should be punished, and the sinner saved. None could imagine such a way of justification as the
apostle in this epistle declares: it was a mystery when hid under the shadows of the law, and a mystery to
the prophets when it sounded from their mouths; they searched it, without being able to comprehend it (1
Peter 1:10, 11.) If it be a mystery, it is humbly to be submitted to: mysteries surmount human reason. The
study of the gospel must not be with a yawning and careless frame. Trades, you call mysteries, are not
learned sleeping and nodding: diligence is required; we must be disciples at God’s feet. As it had God for
the author, so we must have God for the teacher of it; the contrivance was his, and the illumination of our
minds must be from him. As God only manifested the gospel, so he can only open our eyes to see the
mysteries of Christ in it. In verse 26 we may observe,
</p>
<p>
     1. The Scriptures of the Old Testament verify the substance of the New, and the New doth evidence
the authority of the Old, by the Scriptures of the prophets made known. The Old Testament credits the
New, and the New illustrates the Old. The New Testament is a comment upon the prophetic part of the
Old. The Old shews the promises and predictions of God, and the New shews the performance. What was
foretold in the Old, is fulfilled in the New; the predictions are cleared by the events. The predictions of the
Old are divine, because they are above the reason of man to foreknow; none but an infinite knowledge
could foretel them, because none but an infinite wisdom could order all things for the accomplishment of
them. The Christian religion hatb, then, the surest foundation, since the Scriptures of the prophets,
wherein it is foretold, are of undoubted antiquity, and owned by the Jews and many heathens, which are
and were the great enemies of Christ. The Old Testament is therefore to be read for the strengthening of
our faith. Our blessed Saviour himself draws the streams of his doctrine from the Old Testament: he clears
up the promise of eternal life, and the doctrine of the resurrection, from the words of the covenant, “I am
the God of Abraham,” &amp;c. (Matt. 22:32.) And our apostle clears up the doctrine of justification by faith
from God’s covenant with Abraham (Rom. 4.) It must be read, and it must be read as it is writ: it was writ
to a gospel end, it must be studied with a gospel spirit. The Old Testament was writ to give credit to the
New, when it should be manifested in the world. It must be read by us to give strength to our faith, and
establish us in the doctrine of Christianity. How many view it as a bare story, an almanack out of date,
and regard it as a dry bone, without sucking from it the evangelical marrow! Christ is, in Genesis,
Abraham’s seed; in David’s psalms and the prophets, the Messiah and Redeemer of the world.
</p>
<p>
    2. Observe, The antiquity of the gospel is made manifest by the Scriptures of the prophets. It was of as
ancient a date as any prophecy: the first prophecy was nothing else but a gospel charter; it was not made
at the incarnation of Christ, but made manifest. It then rose up to its meridian lustre, and sprung out of the
clouds, wherewith it was before obscured. The gospel was preached to the ancients by the prophets, as
well as to the Gentiles by the apostles (Heb. 4:2); “Unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto
them.” To them first, to us after; to them indeed more cloudy, to us more clear; but they as well as we,
were evangelized, as the word signifies. The covenant of grace was the same in the writings of the
prophets, and the declarations of the evangelists and apostles. Though by our Saviour’s incarnation, the
gospel light was clearer, and, by his ascension, the effusions of the Spirit fuller and stronger; yet the
believers under the Old Testament, saw Christ in the swaddling bands of legal ceremonies, and the lattice
of prophetical writings; they could not else offer one sacrifice, or read one prophecy with a faith of the
right stamp. Abraham’s justifying faith had Christ for its object, though it was not so explicit as ours,
because the manifestation was not so clear as ours.
</p>
<p>
    3. All truth is to be drawn from Scripture. The apostle refers them here to the gospel and the prophets:
the Scripture is the source of divine knowledge; not the traditions of men, nor reason separate from
Scripture. Whosoever brings another doctrine, coins another Christ; nothing is to be added to what is
written, nothing detracted from it. He doth not send us for truth, to the puddles of human inventions, to
the enthusiasms of our brain; not to the See of Rome, no, nor to the instructions of angels; but the writings
of the prophets, as they clear up the declarations of the apostles. The church of Rome is not made here the
standard of truth: but the Scriptures of the prophets are to be the touch-stone to the Romans, for the trial
of the truth of the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    4. How great is the goodness of God! The borders of grace are enlarged to the Gentiles, and not hid
under the skirts of the Jews. He that was so long the God of the Jews, is now also manifest to be the God
of the Gentiles: the gospel is now made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the
everlasting God. Not only in a way of common providence, but special grace; in calling them to the
knowledge of himself, and a justification of them by faith, he hath brought strangers to him, to the
adoption of children, and lodged them under the wings of the covenant, that were before alienated from
him through the universal corruption of nature. Now he hath manifested himself a God of truth, mindful
of his promise in blessing all nations in the seed of Abraham. The fury of devils, and the violence of men
could not hinder the propagation of the gospel: its light hath been dispersed as far as that of the sun; and
that grace that founded in the Gentile’s ears, hath bent many of their hearts to the obedience of it.
</p>
<p>
    5. Observe that libertinism and licentiousness find no encouragement in the gospel. It was made
known to all nations for the obedience of faith. The goodness of God is published, that our enmity to him
may be parted with. Christ’s righteousness is not offered to us to be put on, that we may roll more warmly
in our lusts. The doctrine of grace commands us to give up ourselves to Christ, to be accepted through
him, and to be ruled by him. Obedience is due to God, as a sovereign lord in his law; and it is due out of
gratitude, as he is a God of grace in the gospel. The discovery of a further perfection in God weakens not
the right of another, nor the obligation of the duty the former attribute claims at our hands. The gospel
frees us from the curse, but not from the duty and service: “We are delivered from the hands of our
enemies, that we might serve God in holiness and righteousness” (Luke 1:74.) “This is the will of God” in
the gospel, “even our sanctification.” When a prince strikes off a malefactor’s chains, though he deliver
him from the punishment of his crime, he frees him not from the duty of a subject: his pardon adds a
greater obligation than his protection did before, while he was loyal. Christ’s righteousness gives us a title
to heaven; but there must be a holiness to give us a fitness for heaven.
</p>
<p>
    6. Observe, that evangelical obedience, or the obedience of Faith, is only acceptable to God.
Obedience of faith; genitivus speciei, noting the kind of obedience God requires; an obedience springing
from faith, animated and influenced by faith. Not obedience of faith, as though faith were the rule, and the
law were abrogated; but to the law as a rule, and from faith as a principle. There is no true obedience
before faith (Heb. 11:6.) “Without faith it is impossible to please God;” and therefore without faith
impossible to obey him. A good work cannot proceed from a defiled mind and conscience; and without
faith every man’s mind is darkened, and his conscience polluted (Tit. 1:15.) Faith is the band of union to
Christ, and obedience is the fruit of union; we cannot bring forth fruit without being branches (John 15:4,
5), and we cannot be branches without believing. Legitimate fruit follows upon marriage to Christ, not
before it (Rom. 7:4.) “That you should be married to another, even to him that is raised from the dead, that
you should bring forth fruit unto God.” All fruit before marriage is bastard; and bastards were excluded
from the sanctuary. Our persons must be first accepted in Christ, before our services can be acceptable;
those works are not acceptable where the person is not pardoned, Good works flow from a pure heart; but
the heart cannot be pure before faith. All the good works reckoned up in the eleventh chapter of the
Hebrews were from this spring; those heroes first believed and then obeyed. By faith Abel was righteous
before God, without it his sacrifice had been no better than Cain’s: by faith Enoch pleased God, and had a
divine testimony to his obedience before his translation; by faith Abraham offered up Isaac, without
which he had been no better than a murderer. All obedience hath its root in faith, and is not done in our
own strength, but in the strength and virtue of another, of Christ, whom God hath set forth as our head and
root.
</p>
<p>
    7. Observe, faith and obedience are distinct, though inseparable “The obedience of faith.” Faith,
indeed, is obedience to a gospel command, which enjoins us to believe; but it is not all our obedience.
Justification and sanctification are distinct acts of God; justification respects the person, sanctification the
nature; justification is first in order of nature, and sanctification follows: they are distinct, but inseparable;
every justified person hath a sanctified nature, and every sanctified nature supposeth a justified person. So
faith and obedience are distinct: faith as the principle, obedience as the product; faith as the cause,
obedience as the effect; the cause and the effect are not the same. By faith we own Christ as our Lord. by
obedience we regulate ourselves according to his. command. The acceptance of the relation to him as a
subject, precedes the performance of our duty: by faith we receive his law, and by obedience we fulfil it.
Faith makes us God’s children (Gal. 3:26). Obedience manifests us to be Christ’s disciples (John 15:8).
Faith is the touchstone of obedience; the touchstone, and that which is tried by it, are not the same. But
though they are distinct, yet they are inseparable. Faith and obedience are joined together; obedience
follows faith at the heels. Faith purifies the heart, and a pure heart cannot be without pure actions. Faith
unites us to Christ, whereby we partake of his life; and a living branch cannot be without fruit in its
season, and “much fruit” (John 15:5), and that naturally from a “newness of spirit” (Rom. 7:9); not
constrained by the rigors of the law, but drawn forth from a sweetness of love; for faith works by love.
The love of God is the strong motive, and love to God is the quickening principle; as there can be no
obedience without faith, so no faith without obedience. After all this, the apostle ends with the celebration
of the wisdom of God; “To God only wise, be glory, through Jesus Christ forever.” The rich discovery of
the gospel cannot be thought of, by a gracious soul, without a return of praise to God, and admiration of
his singular wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    Wise God. His power before, and his wisdom here, are mentioned in conjunction (in which his
goodness is included, as interested in his establishing power) as the ground of all the glory and praise God
hath from his creatures.
</p>
<p>
     Only wise. As Christ saith (Matt. 19:17), “None is good, but God;” so the apostle saith, None wise,
but God. As all creatures are unclean in regard of his purity, so they are all fools in regard of his wisdom;
yea, the glorious angels themselves (Job 4:18). Wisdom is the royalty of God; the proper dialect of all his
ways and works. No creature can lay claim to it; he is so wise, that he is wisdom itself.
</p>
<p>
     Be glory, through Jesus Christ. As God is only known in and by Christ, so he must be only
worshipped and celebrated in and through Christ. In him we must pray to him, and in him we must praise
him. As all mercies flow from God through Christ to us, so all our duties are to be presented to God
through Christ. In the Greek, verbatim, it runs thus: “To the alone wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him
be glory forever.” But we must not understand it, as if God were wise by Jesus Christ, but that thanks is to
be given to God through Christ; because in and by Christ God hath revealed his wisdom to the world. The
Greek hath a repetition of the article ῷ, and expressed in the translation, “To him be glory.” Beza
expungeth this article, but without reason, for ῷ is as much as ἀιῷ, “to him;” and joining this, “the only
wise God” with ver. 25, “to him that is of power to establish you;” reading it thus, “To him that is of
power to establish you, the only wise God,” leaving the rest in a parenthesis, it runs smoothly, “to him be
glory, through Jesus Christ,” And Crellius, the Socinian, observes, that this article ῷ, which some leave
out, might be industriously inserted by the apostle, to shew that the glory we ascribe to God is also given
to Christ. We may observe, that neither in this place, nor any where in Scripture, is the Virgin Mary, or
any of the saints, associated with God or Christ in the glory ascribed to them.
</p>
<p>
     In the words there is, 1. An appropriation of wisdom to God, and a remotion of it from all creatures;
“only wise God.” 2. A glorifying him for it. The point I shall insist upon is, That wisdom is a transcendant
excellency of the Divine nature. We have before spoken of the knowledge of God, and the infiniteness of
it; the next attribute is the wisdom of God. Most confound the knowledge and wisdom of God together;
but there is a manifest distinction between them in our conception. I shall handle it thus: I. Shew what
wisdom is. Then lay down, II. Some propositions about the wisdom of God. And shew, III. That God is
wise, and only wise. IV. Wherein his wisdom appears. V. The Use.
</p>
<p>
     I. What wisdom is. Wisdom, among the Greeks, first signified an eminent perfection in any art or
mystery; so a good statuary, engraver, or limner, was called wise, as having an excellent knowledge in his
particular art. But afterwards the title of wise was appropriated to those that devoted themselves to the
contemplation of the highest things that served for a foundation to speculative sciences.759 But ordinarily
we count a man a wise man, when he conducts his affairs with discretion, and governs his passions with
moderation, and carries himself with a due proportion and harmony in all his concerns. But in particular,
wisdom consists,
</p>
<p>
     1. In acting for a right end. The chiefest part of prudence is in fixing a right end, and in choosing fit
means, and directing them to that scope; to shoot at random is a mark of folly. As he is the wisest man
that hath the noblest end and fittest means, so God is infinitely wise; as he is the most excellent being, so
he hath the most excellent end. As there is none more excellent than himself, nothing can be his end but
himself; as he is the cause of all, so he is the end of all; and he puts a true bias into all the means he useth
to hit the mark he aims at: “Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things” (Rom. 11:36).
</p>
<p>
     2. Wisdom consists in observing all circumstances for action. He is counted a wise man that lays hold
of the fittest opportunities to bring his designs about, that hath the fullest foresight of all the little intrigues
which may happen in a business he is to manage, and times every part of his action in an exact harmony
with the proper minutes of it. God hath all the circumstances of things in one entire image before him; he
hath a prospect of every little creek in any design. He sees what second causes will act, and when they
will act this or that; yea, he determines them to such and such acts; so that it is impossible he should be
mistaken, or miss of the due season of bringing about his own purposes. As he hath more goodness than
to deceive any, so he hath more understanding than to be mistaken in any thing. Hence the time of the
incarnation of our blessed Saviour is called the fulness of time, the proper season for his coming. Every
circumstance about Christ was timed according to the predictions of God; even so little a thing as not
parting his garment, and the giving him gall and vinegar to drink; and all the blessings he showers down
upon his people, according to the covenant of grace, are said to come “in his season” (Ezek. 34:25, 26).
</p>
<p>
    3. Wisdom consists in willing and acting according to the right reason, according to a right judgment
of things. We can never count a wilful man a wise man; but him only that acts according to a right rule,
when right counsels are taken and vigorously executed. The resolves and ways of God are not mere will,
but will guided by the reason and counsel of his own infinite understanding (Eph. 1:11); “Who works all
things according to the counsel of his own will.” The motions of the Divine will are not rash, but follow
the proposals of the Divine mind; he chooses that which is fittest to be done, so that all his works are
graceful, and all his ways have a comeliness and decorum in them. Hence all his ways are said to be
“judgment” (Deut. 32:4), not mere will. Hence it appears, that wisdom and knowledge are two distinct
perfections. Knowledge hath its seat in the speculative understanding, wisdom in the practical. Wisdom
and knowledge are evidently distinguished as two several gifts of the Spirit in man (1 Cor. 12:8); “To one
is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit.”
Knowledge is an understanding of general rules, and wisdom is a drawing conclusions from those rules in
order to particular cases. A man may have the knowledge of the whole Scripture, and have all learning in
the treasury of his memory, and yet be destitute of skill to make use of them upon particular occasions,
and untie those knotty questions which may be proposed to him, by a ready application of those rules.
Again, knowledge and wisdom may be distinguished, in our conception, as two distinct perfections in
God: the knowledge of God is his understanding of all things; his wisdom is the skilful resolving and
acting of all things. And the apostle, in his admiration of him, owns them as distinct; “O the depths of the
riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God” (Rom. 11:33)! Knowledge is the foundation of
wisdom, and antecedent to it; wisdom the superstructure upon knowledge: men may have knowledge
without wisdom, but not wisdom without knowledge; according to our common proverb, “The greatest
clerks are not the wisest men.” All practical knowledge is founded in speculation, either secundum rem, as
in a man; or, secundum rationem, as in God. They agree in this, that they are both acts of the
understanding; but knowledge is the apprehension of a thing, and wisdom is the appointing and ordering
of things. Wisdom is the splendor and lustre of knowledge shining forth in operations, and is an act both
of understanding and will; understanding in counselling and contriving, will in resolving and executing:
counsel and will are linked together (Eph. 1:11).
</p>
<p>
    II. The second thing is to lay down some propositions in general, concerning the wisdom of God.
</p>
<p>
    First, There is an essential and a personal wisdom of God. The essential wisdom, is the essence of
God; the personal wisdom is the Son of God. Christ is called Wisdom by himself (Luke 7:35). The
wisdom of God by the apostle (1 Cor. 1:24). The wisdom I speak of belongs to the nature of God, and is
considered a necessary perfection. The personal wisdom is called so, because he opens to us the secrets of
God. If the Son were that wisdom whereby the Father is wise, the Son would be also the essence whereby
the Father is God. If the Son were the wisdom of the Father, whereby he is essentially wise, the Son
would be the essence of the Father, and the Father would have his essence from the Son, since the wisdom
of God is the essence of God; and so the Son would be the Father, if the wisdom and power of the Father
were originally in the Son.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, Therefore the wisdom of God is the same with the essence of God. Wisdom in God is not a
habit added to his essence, as it is in man, but it is his essence. It is like the splendor of the sun, the same
with the sun itself; or like the brightness of crystal, which is not communicated to it by anything else, as
the brightness of a mountain is by the beam of the sun, but it is one with the crystal itself. It is not a habit
superadded to the Divine essence; that would be repugnant to the simplicity of God, and speak him
compounded of divers principles; it would be contrary to the eternity of his perfections: if he be eternally
wise, his wisdom is his essence; for there is nothing eternal but the essence of God. As the sun melts some
things, and hardens others; blackens some things, and whitens others, and produceth contrary qualities in
different subjects, yet it is but one and the same quality in the sun, which is the cause of those contrary
operations; so the perfections of God seem to be diverse in our conceptions, yet they are but one and the
same in God.760 The wisdom of God, is God acting prudently; as the power of God, is God acting
powerfully; and the justice of God, is God acting righteously; and therefore it is more truly said, that God
is wisdom, justice, truth, power, than that he is wise, just, true, &amp;c. as if he were compounded of
substance and qualities. All the operations of God proceed from one simple essence; as all the operations
of the mind of man, though various, proceed from one faculty of understanding. Thirdly, Wisdom is the
property of God alone: He is “only wise.” It is an honor peculiar to him. Upon the account that no man
deserved the title of wise, but that it was a royalty belonging to God,761 Pythagoras would not be called
Ζὸφος, a title given to their learned men, but Φιλόσοφος. The name philosopher arose out of a respect to
this transcendent perfection of God.
</p>
<p>
    1. God is “only wise” necessarily. As he is necessarily God, so he is necessarily wise; for the notion
of wisdom is inseparable from the notion of a Deity. When we say, God is a Spirit, is true, righteous,
wise; we understand that he is transcendently these, by an intrinsic and absolute necessity, by virtue of his
own essence, without the efficiency of any other, or any efficiency in and by himself. God doth not make
himself wise, no more than he makes himself God. As he is a necessary Being in regard of his life, so he
is necessarily wise in regard of his understanding. Synesius saith, that God is essentiated; οὐσιοῦοθαι, by
his understanding. He places the substance of God in understanding and wisdom: wisdom is the first vital
operation of God. He can no more be unwise than he can be untrue; for folly in the mind is much the same
with falsity in speech. Wisdom among men is gained by age and experience, furthered by instructions and
exercise; but the wisdom of God is his nature. As the sun cannot be without light, while it remains a sun,
and as eternity cannot be without immortality, so neither can God be without wisdom as he only hath
immortality (1 Tim. 6:16), not arbitrarily, but necessarily; so he only hath wisdom: not because he will be
wise, but because he cannot but be wise. He cannot but contrive counsels, and exert operations, becoming
the greatness and majesty of his nature.
</p>
<p>
    2. Therefore “only wise” originally. God is αν̓δίδακτος αν̓τόσοφος. Men acquire wisdom by the loss of
their fairest years; but his wisdom is the perfection of the Divine nature, not the birth of study, or the
growth of experience, but as necessary, as eternal, as his essence. He goes not out of himself to search
wisdom: he needs no more the brains of creatures in the contrivance of his purposes, than he doth their
arm in the execution of them. He needs no counsel, he receives no counsel from any (Rom. 11:34): “Who
hath been his counsellor?” and (Isa. 40:14) “With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, or
taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the path of
understanding?” He is the only Fountain of wisdom to others; angels and men have what wisdom they
have, by communication from him. All created wisdom is a spark of the Divine light, like that of the stars
borrowed from the sun. He that borrows wisdom from another, and doth not originally possess it in his
own nature, cannot properly be called wise. As God is the only Being, in regard that all other beings are
derived from him, so he is only wise, because all other wisdom flows from him. He is the spring of
wisdom to all; none the original of wisdom to him.
</p>
<p>
     3. Therefore “only wise” perfectly. There is no cloud upon his understanding. He hath a distinct and
certain knowledge of all things that can fall under action; as he hath a perfect knowledge without
ignorance, so he hath a beautiful wisdom without mole or wart. Men are wise, yet have not an
understanding so vast as to grasp all things, nor a perspicacity so clear, as to penetrate into the depths of
all being. Angels have more delightful and lively sparks of wisdom, yet so imperfect, that in regard of the
wisdom of God they are charged with folly (Job 4:18). Their wisdom as well as their holiness is veiled in
the presence of God. It vanisheth, as the glowing of a fire doth before the beauty of the sun, or as the light
of a candle in the midst of a sunshine contracts itself, and none of its rays are seen, but in the body of the
flame. The angels are not perfectly wise, because they are not perfectly knowing: the gospel, the great
discovery of God’s wisdom, was hid from them for ages.
</p>
<p>
     4. Therefore “only wise” universally. Wisdom in one man is of one sort, in another of another sort;
one is a wise tradesman, another a wise statesman, and another a wise philosopher: one is wise in the
business of the world, another is wise in divine concerns. One hath not so much of plenty of one sort, but
he may have a scantiness in another; one may be wise for invention, and foolish in execution; an artificer
may have skill to frame an engine, and not skill to use it. The ground that is fit for olives may not be fit
for vines; that will bear one sort of grain and not another. But God hath an universal wisdom, because his
nature is wise; it is not limited, but hovers over everything, shines in every being. His executions are as
wise as his contrivances: he is wise in his resolves, and wise in his ways: wise in all the varieties of his
works of creation, government, redemption. As his will wills all things, and his power effects all things,
so his wisdom is the universal director of the motions of his will, and the executions of his power: as his
righteousness is the measure of the matter of his actions, so his wisdom is the rule that directs the manner
of his actions. The absolute power of God is not an unruly power: his wisdom orders all things, so that
nothing is done but what is fit and convenient, and agreeable to so excellent a Being: as he cannot do an
unjust thing because of his righteousnesness, so he cannot do an unwise act, because of his infinite
wisdom. Though God be not necessitated to any operation without himself, as to the creation of anything,
yet supposing he will act, his wisdom necessitates him to do that which is congruous, as his righteousness
necessitates him to do that which is just: so that though the will of God be the principle, yet his wisdom is
the rule of his actions. We must, in our conceiving of the order, suppose wisdom antecedent to will none
that acknowledges a God can have such an impious thought as to affix temerity and rashness to any of his
proceedings. All his decrees are drawn out of the infinite treasury of wisdom in himself.762 He resolves
nothing about any of his creatures without reason; but the reason of his purposes is in himself, and springs
from himself, and not from the creatures: there is not one thing that he wills but “he wills by counsel, and
works by counsel” (Eph. 1:11). Counsel writ down every line, every letter, in his eternal Book; and all the
orders are drawn out from thence by his wisdom and will: what was illustrious in the contrivance, glitters
in the execution. His understanding and will are infinite; what is therefore the act of his will, is the result
of his understanding, and therefore rational. His understanding and will join hands; there is no contest in
God, will against mind, and mind against will; they are one in God, one in his resolves, and one in all his
works.
</p>
<p>
     5. Therefore he is “only wise” perpetually. As the wisdom of man is got by ripeness of age, so it is
lost by decay of years; it is got by instruction, and lost by dotage. The perfectest minds, when in the wane,
have been darkened with folly: Nebuchadnezzar, that was wise for a man, became as foolish as a brute.
But the Ancient of Days is an unchangeable possessor of prudence; his wisdom is a mirror of brightness,
without a defacing spot. It was “possessed by him in the beginning of his ways, before his works of old”
(Prov. 8:22), and he can never be dispossessed of it in the end of his works. It is inseparable from him: the
being of his Godhead may as soon cease as the beauty of his mind; “with him is wisdom” (Job 12:13); it
is inseparable from him; therefore, as durable as his essence. It is a wisdom infinite, and therefore without
increase or decrease in itself. The experience of so many ages in the government of the world hath added
nothing to the immensity of it, as the shining of the sun since the creation of the world hath added nothing
to the light of that glorious body. As ignorance never darkens his knowledge, so folly never disgraces his
prudence. God infatuates men, but neither men nor devils can infatuate God; he is unerringly wise; his
counsel doth not vary and flatter; it is not one day one counsel, and another day another, but it stands like
an immovable rock, or a mountain of brass. “The counsel of the Lord stands forever, and the thoughts of
his heart to all generations” (Psalm 33:11).
</p>
<p>
    6. He is only wise incomprehensibly. “His thoughts are deep” (Psalm 92:5); “His judgments
unsearchable, his ways past finding out” (Rom. 11:33): depths that cannot be fathomed; a splendor more
dazzling to our dim minds than the light of the sun to our weak eyes. The wisdom of one man may be
comprehended by another, and over-comprehended; and often men are understood by others to be wiser in
their actions than they understand themselves to be; and the wisdom of one angel may be measured by
another angel of the same perfection. But as the essence, so the wisdom of God is incomprehensible to
any creature; God is only comprehended by God. The secrets of wisdom in God are double to the
expressions of it in his works (Job 11:6, 7): “Canst thou, by searching, find out God?” There is an
unfathomable depth in all his decrees, in all his works; we cannot comprehend the reason of his works,
much less that of his decrees, much less that in his nature; because his wisdom, being infinite as well as
his power, can no more act to the highest pitch than his power. As his power is not terminated by what he
hath wrought, but he could give further testimonies of it, so neither is his wisdom, but he could furnish us
with infinite expressions and pieces of his skill. As in regard of his immensity he is not bounded by the
limits of place; in regard of his eternity, not measured by the minutes of time; in regard of his power, not
terminated with this or that number of objects; so, in regard of his wisdom, he is not confined to this or
that particular mode of working; so that in regard of the reason of his actions, as well as the glory and
majesty of his nature, he dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16); and whatsoever we understand of
his wisdom in creation and providence, is infinitely less than what is in himself and his own unbounded
nature. Many things in Scripture are declared chiefly to be the acts of the Divine will, yet we must not
think that they were acts of mere will without wisdom, but they are represented so to us, because we are
not capable of understanding the infinite reason of its acts: his sovereignty is more intelligible to us than
his wisdom. We can better know the commands of a superior, and the laws of a prince, than understand
the reason that gave birth to those laws. We may know the orders of the Divine will, as they are
published, but not the sublime reason of his will. Though election be an act of God’s sovereignty, and he
hath no cause from without to determine him, yet his infinite wisdom stood not silent while mere
dominion acted. Whatsoever God doth, he doth wisely, as well as sovereignly; though that wisdom which
lies in the secret places of the Divine Being be as incomprehensible to us as the effects of his sovereignty
and power in the world are visible, God can give a reason of his proceeding, and that drawn from himself,
though we understand it not. The causes of things visible lie hid from us. Doth any man know how to
distinguish the seminal virtue of a small seed from the body of it, and in what nook and corner that lies,
and what that is that spreads itself in so fair a plant, and so many flowers? Can we comprehend the justice
of God’s proceedings in the prosperity of the wicked, and the afflictions of the godly? Yet as we must
conclude them the fruits of an unerring righteousness, so we must conclude all his actions the fruits of an
unspotted wisdom, though the concatenation of all his counsels is not intelligible to us; for he is as
essentially and necessarily wise, as he is essentially and necessarily good and righteous. God is not only
so wise that nothing more wise can be conceived, but he is more wise than can be imagined; something
greater in all his perfections than can be comprehended by any creature. It is a foolish thing, therefore, to
question that which we cannot comprehend; we should adore it instead of disputing against it; and take it
for granted, that God would not order anything, were it not agreeable to the sovereignty of his wisdom, as
well as that of his will. Though the reason of man proceed from the wisdom of God, yet there is more
difference between the reason of man, and the wisdom of God, than between the light of the sun, and the
feeble shining of the glow-worm; yet we presume to censure the ways of God, as if our purblind reason
had a reach above him.
</p>
<p>
    7. God is “only wise” infallibly. The wisest men meet with rubs in the way, that make them fall short
of what they aim at; they often design, and fail; then begin again; and yet all their counsels end in smoke,
and none of them arrive at perfection. If the wisest angels lay a plot, they may be disappointed; for though
they are higher and wiser than man, yet there is One higher and wiser than they, that can check their
projects. God always compasseth his end, never fails of anything he designs and aims at; all his
undertakings are counsel and will; as nothing can resist the efficacy of his will, so nothing can
countermine the skill of his counsel: “There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the
Lord” (Prov. 21:30). He compasseth his ends by those actions of men and devils, wherein they think to
cross him; they shoot at their own mark, and hit his. Lucifer’s plot, by divine wisdom, fulfilled God’s
purpose against Lucifer’s mind. The counsel of redemption by Christ, the end of the creation of the world,
rode into the world upon the back of the serpent’s temptation. God never mistakes the means, nor can
there be any disappointments to make him vary his counsels, and pitch upon other means than what
before he had ordained. His “word that goeth forth of his mouth shall not return to him void, but it shall
accomplish that which he pleases, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto he sent it” (Isa. 55:11). What is
said of his word is true of his counsel; it shall prosper in the thing for which it is appointed; it cannot be
defeated by all the legions of men and devils; for “as he thinks, so shall it come to pass; and as he hath
purposed, so shall it stand; the Lord hath purposed, and who shall disannul it” (Isa. 14:24, 27)? The
wisdom of the creature is a drop from the wisdom of God, and is like a drop to the ocean, and a shadow to
the sun; and, therefore, is not able to meet the wisdom of God, which is infinite and boundless. No
wisdom is exempted from mistakes, but the Divine: he is wise in all his resolves, and never “calls back his
words” and purposes (Isa. 31:2).
</p>
<p>
    III. The third general is to prove that God is wise. This is ascribed to God in Scripture (Dan. 2:20);
“Wisdom and might are his;” wisdom to contrive, and power to effect. Where should wisdom dwell, but
in the head of a Deity? and where should power triumph, but in the arm of Omnipotency?763 All that God
doth, he doth artificially, skilfully; whence he is called the “Builder of the heavens” (Heb. 11:10),
Τεχνίτης an artifical and curious builder, a builder by art: and that word (Prov. 8:30) meant of Christ;
“Then I was by him as one brought up with him;” some render it, Then I was the curious artificer; and the
same word, is translated, a cunning workman (Cant. 7:5). For this cause, counsel is ascribed to God;764
not properly, for counsel implies something of ignorance, or irresolution, antecedent to the consultation,
and a posture of will afterwards, which was not before. Counsel is, properly, a laborious deliberation, and
a reasoning of things; an invention of means for the attainment of the end, after a discussing and
reasoning of all the doubts which arise, pro re natâ, about the matter in counsel. But God hath no need to
deliberate in himself what are the best means to accomplish his ends: he is never ignorant or
undetermined what course he should take, as men are before they consult. But it is an expression, in
condescension to our capacity, to signify that God doth nothing but with reason and understanding, with
the highest prudence and for the most glorious ends, as men do after consultation and the weighing of
every foreseen circumstance. Though he acts all things sovereignly by his will, yet he acts all things
wisely by his understanding; and there is not a decree of his will but he can render a satisfactory reason
for, in the face of men and angels. As he is the cause of all things, so he hath the highest wisdom for the
ordering of all things. If wisdom among men be the knowledge of divine and human things, God must be
infinitey wise, since knowledge is most radiant in him; he knows what angels and men do. and infinitely
more; what is known by them obscurely, is known by him clearly; what is known by man after it is done,
was known by God before it was wrought. By his wisdom, as much as by anything, he infinitely differs
from all his creatures, as by wisdom man differs from a brute. We cannot frame a notion of God, without
conceiving him infinitely wise. We should render him very inconsiderable, to imagine him furnished with
an infinite knowledge, and not have an infinite wisdom to make use of that knowledge, or to fancy him
with a mighty power destitute of prudence. Knowledge without prudence, is an eye without motion; and
power without discretion, is an arm without a head; a hand to act, without understanding to contrive and
model; a strength to act, without reason to know how to act: it would be a miserable notion of a God, to
fancy him with a brutish and unguided power. The heathens, therefore, had, and could not but have, this
natural notion of God. Plato, therefore, calls him Mens;765 and Cleanthes used to call God Reason; and
Socrates thought the title of Ζοφός too magnificent to be attributed to anything else but God alone.
</p>
<p>
     Arguments to prove that God is wise.—Reason 1. God could not be infinitely perfect without wisdom.
A rational nature is better than an irrational nature. A man is not a perfect man without reason; how can
God without it be an infinitely perfect God? Wisdom is the most eminent of all virtues; all the other
perfections of God without this, would be as a body without an aye, a soul without understanding. A
Christian’s graces want their lustre, when they are destitute of the guidance of wisdom: mercy is a
feebleness, and justice a cruelty; patience a timorousness, and courage a madness, without the conduct of
wisdom; so the patience of God would be cowardice, his power an oppression, his justice a tyranny,
without wisdom as the spring and holiness as the rule. No attribute of God could shine with a clue lustre
and brightness without it. Power is a great perfection, but wisdom a greater.766 Wisdom may be without
much power, as in bees and ants; but power is a tyrranical thing without wisdom and righteousness. The
pilot is more valuable because of his skill, than the galley slave because of his strength; and the conduct of
a general more estimable than the might of a private soldier. Generals are chosen more by their skill to
guide, than their strength to act; what a God is a man without prudence; what a nothing would God be
without it! This is the salt that gives relish to all other perfections in a creature; this is the jewel in the ring
of all the excellencies of the Divine nature, and holiness is the splendor of that jewel. Now God being the
first Being, possesses whatsoever is most noble in any being. If therefore wisdom, which is the most
noble perfection in any creature, were wanting to God, he would be deficient in that which is the highest
excellency. God being the living God, as he is frequently termed in Scripture, he hath therefore the most
perfect manner of living, and that must be a pure and intellectual life; being essentially living, he is
essentially in the highest degree of living. As he hath an infinite life above all creatures, so he hath an
infinite intellectual life, and therefore an infinite wisdom; whence some have called God, not sapientem,
but super sapientem,767 not only wise, but above all wisdom.
</p>
<p>
     Reason 2. Without infinite wisdom he could not govern the world. Without wisdom in forming the
matter, which was made by Divine power, the world could have been no other than a chaos; and without
wisdom in government, it could have been no other than a heap of confusion; without wisdom the world
could not have been created in the posture it is. Creation supposeth a determination of the will putting
power upon acting; the determination of the will supposeth the counsel of the understanding, determining
the will: no work, but supposeth understanding as well as will in a rational agent. As without skill things
could not be created, so without it things cannot be governed. Reason is a necessary perfection to him that
presides over all things: without knowledge there could not be in God a foundation for government, and
without wisdom there could not be an exercise of government; and without the most excellent wisdom, he
could not be the most excellent governor. He could not be an universal governor, without a universal
wisdom; nor the sole governor without an unimitable wisdom; nor an independent governor without an
original and independent wisdom; nor a perpetual governor wihout an incorruptible wisdom. He would
not be the Lord of the world in all points, without skill to order the affairs of it. Power and wisdom are
foundations of all authority and government; wisdom to know how to rule and command; power to make
those commands obeyed: no regular order could issue out without the first, nor could any order be
enforced without the second. A feeble wisdom, and a brutish power, seldom or never produce any good
effect. Magistracy without wisdom, would be a frantic power, a rash conduct; like a strong arm when the
eye is out, it strikes it knows not what, and leads it knows not whither. Wisdom without power, would be
like a great body without feet,768 like the knowledge of a pilot that hath lost his arm, who, though he
knows the rule of navigation, and what course to follow in his voyage, yet cannot manage the helm: but
when those two, wisdom and power, are linked together, there ariseth from both a fitness for government.
There is wisdom to propose an end, and both wisdom and power employ means that conduct to that end.
And therefore when God demonstrates to Job his right of government, and the unreasonableness of Job’s
quarrelling with his proceedings, he chiefly urgeth upon him the consideration of those two excellencies
of his nature, power and wisdom, which are expressed in his works (chap. 38–41) A prince without
wisdom, is but a title without a capacity to perform the office; no man without it is fit for government; nor
could God without wisdom exercise a just dominion in the world. He hath, therefore, the highest wisdom,
since he is the universal governor. That wisdom which is able to govern a family, may not be able to
govern a city; and that wisdom which governs a city, may not be able to govern a nation or kingdom,
much less a world. The bounds of God’s government being greater than any, his wisdom for government
must needs surmount the wisdom of all. And though the creatures be not in number actually infinite, yet
they cannot be well governed, but by One endowed with infinite discretion.769 Providential government
can be no more without infinite wisdom, than infinite wisdom can be without Providence.
</p>
<p>
    Reason 3. The creatures working for an end, without their own knowledge, demonstrate the wisdom
of God that guides them. All things in the world work for some end; the ends are unknown to them,
though many of their ends are visible to us. As there was some prime cause, which by his power inspired
them with their several instincts; so there must be some supreme wisdom, which moves and guides them
to their end. As their being manifests his power that endowed them, so the acting according to the rules of
their nature, which they themselves understand not, manifests his wisdom in directing them. Everything
that acts for an end, must know that end, or be directed by another to attain that end. The arrow doth not
know who shoots it, or to what end it is shot, or what mark is aimed at; but the archer that puts it in, and
darts it out of the bow, knows. A watch hath a regular motion, but neither the spring, nor the wheels that
move, know the end of their motion; no man will judge a wisdom to be in the watch, but in the artificer
that disposed the wheels and spring, by a joint combination to produce such a motion for such an end.
Doth either the sun that enlivens the earth, or the earth that travels with the plant, know what plant it
produceth in such a soil, what temper it should be of, what fruit it should bear, and of what color? What
plant knows its own medicinal qualities, its own beautiful flowers, and for what use they are ordained?
When it strikes up its head from the earth, doth it know what proportion of them there will be? yet it
produceth all these things in a state of ignorance. The sun warms the earth, concocts the humors, excites
the virtue of it, and cherishes the seeds which are cast into her lap, yet all unknown to the sun or the earth.
Since, therefore, that nature, that is the immediate cause of those things doth not understand its own
quality, nor operation, nor the end of its action, that which thus directs them must be conceived to have an
infinite wisdom. When things act by a rule they know not, and move for an end they understand not, and
yet work harmoniously together for an end, that all of them, we are sure, are ignorant of, it mounts up our
minds to acknowledge the wisdom of that Supreme Cause that hath ranged all these inferior causes in
their order, and imprinted upon them the laws of their motions. according to the ideas in his own mind,
who orders the rule by which they act, and the end for which they act, and directs every motion according
to their several natures, and therefore possessed with infinite wisdom in his own nature.
</p>
<p>
    Reason 4. God is the fountain of all wisdom in the creatures, and, therefore, is infinitely wise himself.
As he hath a fulness of being in himself, because the streams of being are derived to other things from
him, so he hath a fulness of wisdom, because he is the spring of wisdom to angels and men. That being
must be infinitely wise from whence all other wisdom derives its original; for nothing can be in the effect,
which is not eminently in the cause; the cause is alway more perfect than the effect. If, therefore, the
creatures are wise, the Creator must be much more wise. If the Creator were destitute of wisdom, the
creature would be much more perfect than the Creator. If you consider the wisdom of the spider in her
web, which is both her house and net; the artifice of the bee in her comb, which is both her chamber and
granary; the provision of the pismire in her repositories for corn,—the wisdom of the Creator is illustrated
by them: whatsoever excellency you see in any creature, is an image of some excellency in God. The skill
of the artificer is visible in the fruits of his art; a workman transcribes his spirit in the work of his hands.
But the wisdom of rational creatures, as men, doth more illustrate it; all arts among men are the rays of
Divine wisdom shining upon them, and, by a common gift of the Spirit, enlightening their minds to
curious inventions, as (Prov. 8:12): “I, wisdom, find out the knowledge of witty inventions;” that is, I give
a faculty to men to find them out; without my wisdom all things would be buried in darkness and
ignorance: whatsoever wisdom there is in the world, it is but a shadow of the wisdom of God, a small
rivulet derived from him, a spark leaping out from uncreated wisdom (Isa. 54:16): “He created the smith
that bloweth the coals in the fire, and makes the instruments.” The skill to use those weapons in warlike
enterprises is from him: “I have created the waster to destroy;” it is not meant of creating their persons,
but communicating to them their art; he speaks it there to expel fear from the church of all warlike
reparations against them; he had given men the skill to form and use weapons, and could as well strip
them of it, and defeat their purposes. The art of husbandry is a fruit of divine teaching (Isa. 28:24, 25). If
those lower kinds of knowledge, that are common to all nations, and easily learned by all, are discoveries
of Divine wisdom, much more the nobler sciences, intellectual and political wisdom (Dan. 2:21): “He
gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding;” speaking of the more
abstruse parts of knowledge, “The inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding” (Job 32:8). Hence the
wisdom which Solomon expressed in the harlot’s case (1 Kings 3:28), was, in the judgment of all Israel,
the wisdom of God; that is, a fruit of Divine wisdom, a beam communicated to him from God. Every
man’s soul is endowed, more or less, with those noble qualities; the soul of every man exceeds that of a
brute; if the streams be so excellent, the fountain must be fuller and clearer. The first Spirit must infinitely
more possess what other spirits derive from him by creation; were the wisdom of all the angels in heaven,
and men on earth, collected in one spirit, it must be infinitely less than what is in the spring; for no
creature can be equal to the Creator. As the highest creature already made, or that we can conceive may
be made by infinite power, would be infinitely below God in the notion of a creature, so it would be
infinitely below God in the notion of wise.
</p>
<p>
    IV, The fourth thing is, wherein the wisdom of God appears. It appears, 1st, In creation. 2dly, In
government. 3dly, In redemption.
</p>
<p>
    First, In creation. As in a musical instrument there is first the skill of the workman in the frame, then
the skill of the musician in stringing it proper for such musical notes as he will express upon it, and after
that the tempering of the strings, by various stops, to a delightful harmony, so is the wisdom of God seen
in framing the world, then in tuning it, and afterwards in the motion of the several creatures. The fabric of
the world is called the wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:21): “After that, in the wisdom of God, the world by
wisdom knew not God;” i. e., by the creation the world knew not God. The framing cause is there put for
the effect and the work framed; because the Divine wisdom stepped forth in the creatures, to a public
appearance, as if it had presented itself in a visible shape to man, giving instructions in and by the
creatures, to know and adore him. What we translate (Gen. 1:1) “In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth,” the Targum expresseth, “In wisdom God created the heaven and the earth.” Both bear a
stamp of this perfection on them;770 and when the apostle tells the Romans (Rom. 1:20) “The invisible
things of God were clearly understood by the things that are made,” the word he uses is ποιήμασι not
ἒργοις; this signifies a work of labor, but ποίημα a work of skill, or a poem. The whole creation is a poem,
every species a stanza, and every individual creature a verse in it. The creation presents us with a prospect
of the wisdom of God, as a poem doth the reader with the wit and fancy of the composer: “By wisdom he
created the earth” (Prov. 3:19), “and stretched out the heavens by discretion” (Jer. 10:12). There is not
anything so mean, so small, but glitters with a beam of Divine skill; and the consideration of them would
justly make every man subscribe to that of the psalmist, “O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom
hast thou made them all” (Psalm 104:24). All, the least as well as the greatest, and the meanest as well as
the noblest; even those creatures which seem ugly and deformed to us, as toads, &amp;c., because they fall
short of those perfections which are the dowry of other animals: in these there is a footstep of Divine
wisdom, since they were not produced by him at random, but determined to some particular end, and
designed to some usefulness, as parts of the world in their several natures and stations. God could never
have had a satisfaction in the review of his works, and pronounced them good or comely, as he did (Gen.
1:31), had they not been agreeable to that eternal original copy in his own mind. It is said he was
refreshed, viz. with that review (Exod. 31:17), which could not have been, if his piercing eye had found
any defect in any thing which had sprung out of his hand, or an unsuitableness to that end for which he
created them. He seems to do as a man that hath made a curious and polite work, with exact care to peer
about every part and line, if he could perceive any imperfection in it, to rectify the mistake: but no defect
was found by the infinitely wise God upon this second examination. This wisdom of the creation appears,
1. In the variety. 2. In the beauty. 3. The fitness of every creature for its use. 4. The subordination of one
creature to another, and the joint concurrence of all to one common end.
</p>
<p>
    1. In the variety (Psalm 104:24): “O Lord, how manifold are thy works!” How great a variety is there
of animals and plants, with a great variety of forms, shapes, figurations, colors, various smells, virtues,
and qualities! and this rarity is produced from one and the same matter, as beasts and plants from the earth
(Gen. 1:11, 24): “Let the earth bring forth living creatures; and the earth brought forth grass, and the herb
yielding seed after his kind:” such diversity of fowl and fish from the water (Gen. 1:20): “Let the waters
bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly;” such a beautiful and
active variety from so dull a matter as the earth; so solid a variety from so fluid a matter as the water; so
noble a piece as the body of man, with such variety of members fit to entertain a more-excellent soul as a
guest, from so mean a matter as the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). This extraction of such variety of forms
out of one single and dull matter, is the chemistry of Divine wisdom. It is a greater skill to frame noble
bodies of vile matter, as varieties of precious vessels of clay and earth, than of a nobler matter, as gold
and silver. Again, all those varieties propagate their kind in every particular and quality of their nature,
and uniformly bring forth exact copies according to the first pattern God made of the kind (Gen. 1:11, 12,
24). Consider, also, how the same piece of ground is garnished with plants and flowers of several virtues,
fruits, colors, scents, without our being able to perceive any variety in the earth that breeds them, and not
so great a difference in the roots that bear them. Add to this the diversities of birds of different colors,
shapes, notes, consisting of various parts, wings like oars, to cut the air, and tails as the rudder of a ship,
to guide their motion. How various, also, are the endowments of the creatures! some have vegetation, and
the power of growth; others have the addition of sense, and others the excellency of reason; something
wherein all agree, and something wherein all differ; variety in unity, and unity in variety: the wisdom of
the workman had not been so conspicuous had there been only one degree of goodness: the greatest skill
is seen in the greatest variety. The comeliness of the body is visible in the variety of members, and their
usefulness to one another. What an inform thing had man been had he been all ear, or all eye! If God had
made all the stars to be suns, it would have been a demonstration of his power, but, perhaps, less of his
wisdom: no creatures, with the natures they now have, could have continued in being under so much heat:
there was no less wisdom went to the frame of the least, than to the greatest creature. It speaks more art in
a limner to paint a landscape exactly, than to draw the sun, though the sun be a more glorious body. might
instance also, in the different characters and features imprinted upon the countenances of men and
women, the differences of voices and statures, whereby they are distinguished from one another: these are
the foundations of order and of human society, and administration of justice. What confusion would have
been, if a grown-up son could not be known from his father, the magistrate from the subject, the creditor
from the debtor, the innocent from the criminal! The laws God hath given to mankind could not have been
put in execution: this variety speaks the wisdom of God.
</p>
<p>
    2. The wisdom of the creation ap ears in the beauty, and order, and situation of the several creatures
(Eccles. 3:11): “He hath made everything beautiful in his time.” As their being was a fruit of Divine
power, so their order is a fruit of Divine wisdom. All creatures are as members in the great body of the
world, proportioned to one another, and contributing to the beauty of the whole; so that if the particular
forms of everything, the union of all for the composition of the world, and the laws which are established
in the order of nature for its conservation, be considered, it would ravish us with an admiration of God.771
All the creatures are so many pictures or statues, exactly framed by line (Psalm 19:4): “Their line is gone
through all the earth;” their “line,” a measuring line, or a carpenter’s rule, whereby he proportions several
pieces to be exactly linked and coupled together. “Their line,” that is, their harmonious proportion, and
the instruction from it, is gone forth through all the earth. Upon the account of this harmony, some of the
ancient heathens framed the images of their gods with musical instruments in their hands, signifying that
God wrought all things in a due proportion.772 The heavens speak this wisdom in their order. The
revolutions of the sun and moon determine the seasons of the year, and make day and night in orderly
succession. The stars beautify the heavens, and influence the earth, and keep their courses (Judges 5:20).
They keep their stations without interfering with one another; and though they have rolled about for so
many ages, they observe their distinct laws, and in the variety of their motions have not disturbed one
another’s functions. The sun is set as the heart in the midst of this great body, to afford warmth to all: and
had it been set lower, it had long since turned the earth into flame and ashes: had it been placed higher,
the earth would have wanted the nourishment and refreshment necessary for it. Too much nearness had
ruined the earth by parching heat, and too great a distance had destroyed the earth by starving it with
cold.773 The sun hath also its appointed motion; had it been fixed without motion, half of the earth had
been unprofitable; there had been a perpetual darkness in a moiety of it; nothing had been produced for
nourishment, and so it had been rendered uninhabitable: but now, by its motion, it visits all the climates of
the world, runs its circuit, so that “nothing is hid from the heat thereof” (Psalm 19:6). It imparts its virtue
to every corner of the world in its daily and yearly visits. Had it been fixed, the fruits of the earth under it
had been parched and destroyed before their maturity; but all those inconveniences are provided against
by the perpetual motion of the sun. This motion is orderly; it makes its daily course from east to west, its
yearly motion from north to south: it goes to the north, till it comes to the point God hath set it, and then
turns back to the south, and gains some point every day: it never riseth nor sets in the same place one day,
where it did the day before. The world is never without its light; some see it rising the same moment we
see it setting.774 The earth also speaks the Divine wisdom; it is the pavement of the world, as the heaven is
the ceiling of fretwork. It is placed lowermost, as being the heaviest body, and fit to receive the weightiest
matter, and provided as an habitation proper for those creatures which derive the matter of their bodies
from it, and partake of its earthly nature; and garnished with other creatures for the profit or pleasure of
man.775 The sea also speaks the same Divine wisdom. “He strengthened the fountains of the deep, and
gave the sea a decree that it should not pass his command” (Prov. 8:28, 29). He hath given it certain
bounds that it should not overflow the earth (Job 28:11). It contains itself in the situation wherein God
hath placed it, and doth not transgress its bounds. What if some part of a country, a little spot, hath been
overflowed by it, and groaned under its waves? yet for the main, it retains the same channels wherein it
was at first lodged. All creatures are clothed with an outward beauty, and endowed with an inward
harmony; there is an agreement in all parts of this great body; every one is beautiful and orderly; but the
beauty of the world results from all of them disposed and linked together.
</p>
<p>
    3. This wisdom is seen in the fitness of everything for its end, and the usefulness of it. Divine wisdom
is more illustrious in the fitness and usefulness of this great variety, than in the composure of their distinct
parts: as the artificer’s skill is more eminent in fitting the wheels, and setting them in order for their due
motion, than in the external fabric of the materials which compose the clock. After the most diligent
inspection, there can be found nothing in the creation unprofitable; nothing but is capable of some service,
either for the support of our bodies, recreation of our senses, or moral instruction of our minds: not the
least creature but is formed, and shaped, and furnished with members and parts, in a due proportion for its
end and service in the world; nothing is superfluous, nothing defective. The earth is fitted in its parts;776
the valleys are appointed for granaries, the mountains to shadow them from the scorching heat of the sun;
the rivers, like veins, carry refreshment to every member of this body; plants and trees thrive on the face
of the earth, and metals are engendered in the bowels of it, for materials for building, and other uses for
the service of man. “There he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man, that
he may bring forth food out of the earth” (Psalm 114:14). The sea is fitted for use; it is a fish pond for the
nourishment of man; a boundary for the dividing of lands and several dominions: it joins together nations
far distant: a great vessel for commerce (Psalm 114:26), “there go the ships.” It affords vapors to the
clouds, wherewith to water the earth, which the sun draws up, separating the finer from the salter parts,
that the earth may be fruitful without being burdened with barrenness by the salt. The sea hath also its
salt, its ebbs, and floods; the one as brine, the other as motion, to preserve it from putrefaction, that it may
not be contagious to the rest of the world. Showers are appointed to refresh the bodies of living creatures,
to open the womb of the earth, and “water the ground to make it fruitful” Psalm 104:3. The clouds,
therefore, are called the chariots of God; he rides in them in the manifestation of his goodness and
wisdom. Winds are fitted to purify the air, to preserve it from putrefaction, to carry the clouds to several
parts, to refresh the parched earth, and assist her fruits: and also to serve for the commerce of one nation
with another by navigation.777 God, in his wisdom and goodness, “walks upon the wings of the wind”
(Psalm 104:3). Rivers778 are appointed to hathe the ground, and render it fresh and lively; they fortify
cities, are the limits of countries, serve for commerce; they are the watering-pots of the earth, and the
vessels for drink for the living creatures that dwell upon the earth. God cut those channels for the wild
asses, the beasts of the desert, which are his creatures as well as the rest (Psalm 104:10, 12, 13). Trees are
appointed for the habitations of birds, shadows for the earth, nourishment for the creatures, materials for
building, and fuel for the relief of man against cold. The seasons of the year have their use; the winter
makes the juice retire into the earth, fortifies plants, and fixes their roots: it moistens the earth that was
dried before by the heat of summer. and cleanseth and prepares it for a new fruitfulness. The spring calls
out the sap in new leaves and fruit. The summer consumes the superfluous moisture, and produceth
nourishment for the inhabtants of the world.779 The day and night have also their usefulness: the day gives
life to labor, and is a guide to motion and action (Psalm 104:24), “The sun ariseth, man goeth forth to his
labor until the evening.” It warms the air, and quickens nature; without day the world would be a chaos,
an unseen beauty. The night indeed casts a veil upon the bravery of the earth, but it draws the curtains
from that of heaven; though it darkens below, it makes us see the beauty of the world above, and
discovers to us a glorious part of the creation of God, the tapestry of heaven, and the motions of the stars,
hid from us by the eminent light of the day. It procures a truce from labor, and refresheth the bodies of
creatures, by recruiting the spirits which are scattered by watching. It prevents the ruin of life, by a
reparation of what was wasted in the day. It takes from us the sight of flowers and plants, but it washeth
their face with dews for a new appearance next morning. The length of the day and night is not without a
mark of wisdom; were they of a greater length, as the length of a week or month, the one would too much
dry, and the other too much moisten; and for want of action, the members would be stupified. The
perpetual succession of day and night is an evidence of the Divine wisdom in tempering the travel and rest
of crea. tures. Hence, the psalmist tells us (Psalm 84:16, 17), “The day is thine, and the night is thine; thou
hast prepared the light of the sun, and made summer and winter;” i. e. they are of God’s framing, not
without a wise counsel and end. Hence, let us ascend to the bodies of living creatures, and we shall find
every member fitted for use. What a curiosity is there in every member! Every one fitted to a particular
use in their situation, form, temper, and mutual agreement for the good of the whole: the eye to direct; the
ear to receive directions from others; the hands to act; the feet to move. Every creature hath members
fitted for that element wherein it resides; and in the body, some parts are appointed to change the food
into blood, others to refine it, and others to distribute and convey it to several parts for the maintenance of
the whole: the heart to mint vital spirits for preserving life, and the brain to coin animal spirits for life and
motion; the lungs to serve for the cooling the heart, which else would be parched as the ground in
summer. The motion of the members of the body by one act of the will, and also without the will by a
natural instinct, is an admirable evidence of Divine skill in the structure of the body; so that well might
the psalmist cry out (Psalm 139:14), “I am fearfully and wonderfully made!” But how much more of this
Divine perfection is seen in the soul! A nature, furnished with a faculty of understanding to judge of
things, to gather in things that are distant, and to reason and draw conclusions from one thing to another,
with a memory to treasure up things that are past, with a will to apply itself so readily to what the mind
judges fit and comely, and fly so speedily from what it judges ill and hurtful. The whole world is a stage;
every creature in it hath a part to act, and a nature suited to that part and end it is designed for; and all
concur in a joint language to publish the glory of Divine wisdom; they have a voice to proclaim the “glory
of God” (Psalm 19:1, 3). And it is not the least part of God’s skill, in framing the creatures so, that upon
man’s obedience, they are the channels of his goodness; and upon man’s disobedience, they can, in their
natures, be the ministers of his justice for the punishing of offending creatures.
</p>
<p>
    4. This wisdom is apparent in the linking of all these useful parts together, so that one is subordinate
to the other for a common end. All parts are exactly suited to one another, and every part to the whole,
though they are of different natures, as lines distant in themselves, yet they meet in one common centre,
the good and the preservation of the universe; they are all jointed together, as the word translated framed
(Heb. 11:2) signifies; knit by fit hands and ligaments to contribute mutual beauty, strength, and assistance
to one another; like so many links of a chain coupled together, that though there be a distance in place,
there is a unity in regard of connection and end, there is a consent in the whole (Hos. 2:21, 22). “The
heavens hear the earth; and the earth hears the corn, and the wine, and the oil.” The heavens communicate
their qualities to the earth, and the earth conveys them to the fruits she bears.780 The air distributes light,
wind and rain to the earth; the earth and the sea render to the air exhalations and vapors, and altogether
charitably give to the plants and animals that which is necessary for their nourishment and refreshment.
The influences of the heavens animate the earth; and the earth affords matter, in part, for the influences it
receives from the regions above. Living creatures are maintained by nourishment; nourishment is
conveyed to them by the fruits of the earth; the fruits of the earth are produced by means of rain and heat;
matter for rain and dew is raised by the heat of the sun; and the sun by its motion distributes heat and
quickening virtue to all parts of the earth. So colors are made for the pleasure of the eye, sounds for the
delight of the ear; light is formed, whereby the eye may see the one, and air to convey the species of
colors to the eye, and sound to the ear; all things are like the wheels of a watch compacted: and though
many of the creatures be endowed with contrary qualities, yet they are joined in a marriage-knot for the
public security, and subserviency to the preservation and order of the universe; as the variety of strings
upon an instrument, sending forth various and distinct sounds, are tempered together, for the framing
excellent and delightful airs. In this universal conspiring of the creatures together to one end, is the
wisdom of the Creator apparent; in tuning so many contraries as the elements are, and preserving them in
their order, which if once broken, the whole frame of nature would crack, and fall in pieces; all are so
interwoven and inlaid together, by the Divine workmanship, as to make up one entire beauty in the whole
fabric: as every part in the body of man hath a distinct comeliness, yet there is besides, the beauty of the
whole, that results from the union of divers parts exactly fashioned to one another, and linked together.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, Use. How much may we see of the perfection of God in everything that presents itself to
our eyes! And how should we be convinced of our unworthy neglect of ascending to him with reverend
and admiring thoughts, upon the prospect of the creatures! What dull scholars are we, when every creature
is our teacher, every part of the creature a lively instruction! Those things that we tread under our feet, if
used by us according to the full design of their creation, would afford rich matter, not only for our heads,
but our hearts. As grace doth not destroy nature, but elevate it, so neither should the fresher and fuller
discoveries of Divine wisdom in redemption deface all our thoughts of his wisdom in creation. Though
the greater light of the sun obscures the lesser sparkling of the stars, yet it gives way in the night to the
discovery of them, that God may seen, known, and considered, in all his works of wonder, and miracles of
nature. No part of Scripture is more spiritual than the Psalms; none filled with clearer discoveries of
Christ in the Old Testament; yet how often do the penmen consider the creation of God, and find their
meditations on him to be sweet, as considered in his works (Psalm 104:34)! “My meditation of him shall
be sweet.” When? why, after a short history of the goodness and wisdom of God in the frame of the
world, and the species of the creatures.
</p>
<p>
     Secondly. The wisdom of God appears in his government of his creatures. The regular motion of the
creatures speaks for this perfection, as well as the exact composition of them. If the exquisiteness of the
frame conducts us to the skill of the Contriver, the exactness of their order, according to his will and law,
speaks no less the wisdom of the Governor. It cannot be thought that a rash and irrational power presides
over a world so well disposed: the disposition of things hath no less characters of skill, than the creation
of them. No man can hear an excellent lesson upon a lute, but must presently reflect upon the art of the
person that touches it. The prudence of man appears in wrapping up the concerns of a kingdom m his
mind, for the well-ordering of it; and shall not the wisdom of God shine forth, as he is the director of the
world? I shall omit his government of inanimiate creatures, and confine the discourse to his government
of man, as rational, as sinful, as restored.
</p>
<p>
     1st. In his government of man as a rational creature.
</p>
<p>
     1. In the law he gives to man. Wisdom framed it, though will enacted it. The will of God is the rule of
righteousness to us, but the wisdom of God is the foundation of that rule of righteousness which he
prescribes us. The composure of a musician is the rule of singing to his scholars; yet the consent and
harmony in that composure derives not itself from his will, but from his understanding; he would not be a
musician if his composures were contrary to the rules of true harmony: so the laws of men are composed
by wisdom, though they are enforced by will and authority.781 The moral law, which was the law of
nature, the law imprinted upon Adam, is so framed as to secure the rights of God as supreme, and the
rights of men in their distinctions of superiority and equality: it is therefore called “holy and good” (Rom.
7:12); holy, as it prescribes our duty to God in his worship; good, as it regulates the offices of human life,
and reserves the common interest of mankind.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) It is suite to the nature of man. As God hath given a law of nature, a fixed order to inanimate
creatures, so he hath given a law of reason to rational creatures: other creatures are not capable of a law
differencing good and evil, because they are destitute of faculties and capacities to make distinction
between them. It had not been agreeable to the wisdom of God to propose any moral law to them, who
had neither understanding to discern, nor will to choose. It is therefore to be observed, that whilst Christ
exhorted others to the embracing his doctrine, yet he exhorted not little children, though he took them in
his arms, because, though they had faculties, yet they were not come to such a maturity as to be capable of
a rational instruction. But there was a necessity for some command for the government of man; since God
had made him a rational creature, it was not agreeable to his wisdom to govern him as a brute, but as a
rational creature, capable of knowing his precepts, and voluntarily walking in them; and without a law, he
had not been capable of any exercise of his reason in services respecting God. He therefore gives him a
law, with a covenant annexed to it, whereby man is obliged to obedience, and secured of a reward. This
was enforced with severe penalties, death, with all the horrors attending it, to deter him from transgression
(Gen. 2:17); wherein is implied a promise of continuance of life, and all its felicities, to allure him to a
mindfulness of his obligation. So perfect a hedge did Divine wisdom set about him, to keep him within
the bounds of that obedience, which was both his debt and security, that wheresoever he looked, he saw
either something to invite him, or something to drive him to the payment of his duty, and perseverance in
it. Thus the law was exactly framed to the nature of man; man had twisted in him a desire of happiness;
the promise was suited to cherish this natural desire. He had also the passion of fear; the proper object of
this was any thing destructive to his being, nature, and felicity; this the threatening met with. In the whole
it was accommodated to man as rational; precepts to the law in his mind, promises to the natural appetite,
threatemngs to the most prevailing affection, and to the implanted desires of preserving both his being and
happiness in that being. These were rational motives, fitted to the nature of Adam, which was above the
life God had given plants, and the sense he had given animals. The command given man in innocence was
suited to his strength and power. God gave him not any command but what he had ability to observe: and
since we want not power to forbear an apple in our corrupted and impotent state, he wanted not strength in
his state of integrity. The wisdom of God commanded nothing but what was very easy to be observed by
him, and inferior to his natural ability. It had been both unjust and unwise to have commanded him to fly
up to the sun, when he had not wings; or stop the course of the sea, when he had not strength.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) It is suited to the happiness and benefit of man. God’s laws are not an act of mere authority
respecting his own glory, but of wisdom and goodness respecting man’s benefit. They are perfective of
man’s nature, conferring a wisdom upon him, “rejoicing his heart, enlightening his eyes” (Psalm 19:7, 8),
affording him both a knowledge of God and of himself. To be without a law, is for men to be as beasts,
without justice and without religion: other things are for the good of the body, but the laws of God for the
good of the soul; the more perfect the law, the greater the benefit. The laws given to the Jews were the
honor and excellency of that nation (Deut. 1:8); “What nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
judgments so righteous?” They were made statesmen in the judicial law, ecclesiastics in the ceremonial,
honest men in the second table, and divine in the first. All his laws are suited to the true satisfaction of
man, and the good of human society. Had God framed a law only for one nation, there would have been
the characters of a particular wisdom; but now an universal wisdom appears, in accommodating his law,
not only to this or that particular society or corporation of men, but to the benefit of all mankind, in the
variety of climates and countries wherein they live; everything that is disturbing to human society is
provided against; nothing is enjoined but what is sweet, rational, and useful: it orders us not to attempt
anything against the life of our neighbor, the honor of his bed, propriety in his goods, and the clearness of
his reputation; and, if well observed, would alter the face of the world, and make it look with another hue.
The world would be altered from a brutish to a human world; it would change lions and wolves, men of
lionlike and wolfish disposition, into reason and sweetness. And because the whole law is summed up in
love, it obligeth us to endeavor the preservation of one another’s beings, the favoring of one another’s
interests, and increasing the goods, as much as justice will permit, and keeping up one another’s credits,
because love, which is the soul of the law, is not shown by a cessation from action, but signifies an ardor,
upon all occasions, in doing good. I say, were this law well observed, the world would be another thing
than it is: it would become a religious fraternity; the voice of enmity, and the noise of groans and
cursings, would not be heard in our streets; peace would be in all borders; plenty of charity in the midst of
cities and countries; joy and singing would sound in all habitations. Man’s advantage was designed in
God’s laws, and doth naturally result from the observance of them. God so ordered them, by his wisdom,
that the obedience of man should draw forth his goodness, and prevent those smarting judgments which
were necessary to reduce the creature to order that would not voluntarily continue in the order God had
appointed. The laws of men are often unjust, oppressive, cruel, sometimes against the law of nature; but
an universal wisdom and righteousness glitters in the Divine law; there is nothing in it but is worthy of
God, and useful for the creature; so that we may well say, with Job, “Who teaches like God?” (Job 36:22)
or as some render it, “Who is a lawgiver like God?” Who can say to him, Thou hast wrought iniquity or
folly among men? His precepts were framed for the preservation of man in that rectitude wherein he was
created, in that likeness to God wherein he was first made, that there might be a correspondence between
the integrity of the creature and the goodness of his Creator, by the obedience of man; that man might
exercise his faculties in operation worthy of him, and beneficial to the world.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) The wisdom of God is seen in suiting his laws to the consciences as well as the interests of all
mankind (Rom. 2:14); “The Gentiles do, by nature, the things contained in the law;” so great an affinity
there is between the wise law and the reason of man. There is a natural beauty emerging from them, and
darting upon the reasons and consciences of men, which dictates to them that this law is worthy to be
observed in itself. The two main principles of the law, the love and worship of God, and doing as we
would be done by, have an indelible impression in the consciences of all men in regard of the principle,
though they are not suitably expressed in the practice. Where there no law outwardly ublished, yet every
man’s conscience would dictate to him that God. Was to be acknowledged, worshipped, loved, as
naturally as his reason would acquaint him that there was such a being as God. This suitableness of them
to the consciences of men is manifest, in that the laws of the best governed nations among the heathen
have bad an agreement with them. Nothing can be more exactly composed, according to the rules of right
and exact reason, than this; no man but approves of something in it, yea, of the whole, when he exerciseth
that dim reason which he hath. Suppose any man, not an absolute atheist, he cannot but acknowledge the
reasonableness of worshipping God. Grant him to be a spirit, and it will presently appear absurd to
represent him by any corporeal image, and derogate from his excelleency by so mean a resemblance; with
the same easiness he will grant a reverence due to the name of God; that we must not serve our turn of
him, by calling him to witness to a lie in a solemn oath; that as worship is due to him, so is some stated
time a circumstance necessary to the performance of that worship. And as to the second table, will any
man, in his right reason, quarrel with that command that engageth his inferiors to honor him, that secures
his being from a violent murder, and his goods from unjust rapine? and though, by the fury of his lusts, he
break the laws of wedlock himself, yet he cannot but approve of that law, as it prohibits every man from
doing him the like injury and disgrace. The suitableness of the law to the consciences of men is further
evidenced by those furious reflections, and strong alarms of conscience, upon a transgression of it, and
that in all parts of the world, more or less, in all men; so exactly hath Divine wisdom fitted the law to the
reason and consciences of men, as one tally to another: indeed, without such an agreement, no man’s
conscience could have any ground for a hue and cry; nor need any man be startled with the records of it.
This manifests the wisdom of God in framing his laws so that the reasons and consciences of all men do,
one time or other, subscribe to it. What governor in the world is able to make any law distinct from this
revealed by God, that shall reach all places, all persons, all hearts? We may add to this the extent of his
commands, in ordering goodness at the root, not only in action, but affection; not only in the motion of
the members, but the disposition of the soul; which suiting a law to the inward frame of man, is quite out
of the compass of the wisdom of any creature.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) His wisdom is seen in the encouragements he gives for the studying and observing his will (Psalm
19:11); “In keeping thy commandments there is great reward.” The variety of them; there is not any
particular genius in man but may find something suitable to win upon him in the revealed will of God.
There is a strain of reason to satisfy the rational; of eloquence, to gratify the fanciful; of interest, to allure
the selfish; of terror, to startle the obstinate. As a skilful angler stores himself with baits, according to the
appetites of the sorts of fish he intends to catch, so in the word of God there are varieties of baits,
according to the varieties of the inclinations of men; threatenings to work upon fear; promises to work
upon love; examples of holy men set out for imitation; and those plainly; neither his threatenings nor his
promises are dark, as the heathen oracles; but peremptory, as becomes a sovereign lawgiver; and plain, as
was necessary for the understanding of a creature. As he deals graciously with men in exhorting and
encouraging them, so he deals wisely herein, by taking away all excuse from them if they ruin the interest
of their souls, by denying obedience to their Sovereign. Again, the rewards God proposeth are
accommodated, not to the brutish parts of man, his carnal sense and fleshly appetite, but to the capacity of
a spiritual soul, which admits only of spiritual gratifications; and cannot, in its own nature, without a
sordid subjection to the humors of the body, be moved by sensual proposals. God backs his precepts with
that which the nature of man longed for, and with spiritual delights, which can only satisfy a rational
appetite; and thereby did as well gratify the noblest desires in man, as oblige him to the noblest service
and work.782 Indeed, virtue and holiness being perfectly amiable, ought chiefly to affect our
understandings, and by them draw our wills to the esteem and pursuit of them. But since the desire of
happiness is inseparable from the nature of man, as impossible to be disjoined as an inclination to descend
to be severed from heavy bodies, or an instinct to ascend from light and airy substances; God serves
himself of the inclination of our natures to bappiness, to enjender in us an esteem and affection to the
holiness he doth require. He proposeth the enjoyment of a supernatural good and everlasting glory, as a
bait to that insatiable longing our natures have for happiness, to receive the impression of holiness into
our souls. And, besides, he doth proportion rewards according the degrees of men’s industry, labor, and
zeal for him; and weighs out a recompense, not only suited to, but above the service. He that improves
five talents, is to be ruler over five cities; that is, a greater proportion of honor and glory than another
(Luke 19:17, 18); as a wise father excites the affection of his children to things worthy of praise, by
varieties of recompenses according to their several actions. And it was the wisdom of the steward, in the
judgment of our Saviour, to give every one the “portion that belonged to him” (Luke 12:42). There is no
part of the word wherein we meet not with the will and wisdom of God, varieties of duties, and varieties
of encouragement, mingled together.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) The wisdom of God is seen in fitting the revelations of his will to aftertimes, and for the
preventing of the foreseen corruptions of men. The whole revelation of the mind of God is stored with
wisdom in the words, connexion, sense; it looks backwards to past, and forwards to ages to come: a
hidden wisdom lies in the bowels of it, like gold in a mine. The Old Testament was so composed, as to
fortify the New, when God should bring it to light. The foundations of the gospel were laid in the law: the
predictions of the Prophets, and figures of the law, were so wisely framed, and laid down in such clear
expressions, as to be proofs of the authority of the New Testament, and convictions of Jesus’ being the
Messiah (Luke 24:14). Things concerning Christ were written in Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms; and
do, to this day, stare the Jews so in the face, that they are fain to invent absurd and nonsensical
interpretations to excuse their unbelief, and continue themselves in their obstinate blindness. And in
pursuance of the efficacy of those predictions, it was a part of the wisdom of God to bring forth the
translation of the Old Testament, (by the means of Ptolomy, king of Egypt, some hundreds of years before
the coming of Christ) into the Greek language, the tongue then most known in the world; and why? to
prepare the Gentiles, by the reading of it, for that gracious call he intended them, and for the
entertainment of the gospel, which some few years after was to be published among them; that, by reading
the predictions so long before made, they might more readily receive the accomplishment of them in their
due time. The Scripture is written in such a manner, as to obviate errors foreseen by God to enter into the
church. It may be wondered, why the universal particle should be inserted by Christ, in the giving the cup
in the supper, which was not in the distributing the bread (Matt. 24:27): “Drink ye all of it;” not at the
distributing the bread, “Eat you all of it;” and Mark, in his relation, tells us, “They all drank of it” (Mark
11:23). The church of Rome hath been the occasion of discovering to us the wisdom of our Saviour, in
inserting that particle all, since the? were so bold to exclude the communicants from the cup by a trick of
concomitancy. Christ foresaw the error, and therefore put in a little word to obviate a great invasion: and
the Spirit of God hath particularly left upon record that particle, as we may reasonably suppose to such a
purpose. And so, in the description of the “blessed Virgin” (Luke 1:27), there is nothing of her holiness
mentioned, which is with much diligence recorded of Elizabeth (ver. 6): “Righteous, walking in all the
commandments of God, blameless;” probably to prevent the superstition which God foresaw would arise
in the world. And we do not find more undervaluing speeches uttered by Christ to any of his disciples, in
the exercise of his office, than to her, except to Peter. As when she acquainted him with the want of wine
at the marriage in Cana, she receives a slighting answer: “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” (John
2:4) And when one was admiring the blessedness of her that bare him, he turns the discourse another way,
to pronounce a blessedness rather belonging to them that “hear the word of God, and keep it” (Luke
11:27, 28); in a mighty wisdom to antidote his people against any conceit of the prevalency of the Virgin
over him in heaven, in the exercise of his mediatory office.
</p>
<p>
    2. As his wisdom appears in his government by his laws, so it appears in the various inclinations and
conditions of men. As there is a distinction of several creatures, and several qualities in them, for the
common good of the world, so among men there are several inclinations and several abilities, as donatives
from God, for the common advantage of human society; as several channels cut out from the same river
run several ways, and refresh several soils, one man is qualified for one employment, another marked out
by God for a different work, yet all of them fruitful to bring in a revenue of glory to God, and a harvest of
profit to the rest of mankind. How unuseful would the body be, if it had but “one member” (1 Cor. 12:19)!
How unprovided would a house be, if it had not vessels of dishonor as well as of honor! The corporation
of mankind would be as much a chaos, as the matter of the heavens and the earth was, before it was
distinguished by several forms breathed into it at the creation. Some are inspired with a particular genius
for one art, some for another; every man hath a distinct talent. If all were husbandmen, where would be
the instruments to plough and reap? If all were artificers, where would they have corn to nourish
themselves? All men are like vessels, and parts in the body, designed for distinct offices and functions for
the good of the whole, and mutually return an advantage to one another. As the variety of gifts in the
church is a fruit of the wisdom of God, for the preservation and increase of the church, so the variety of
inclinations and employments in the world is a fruit of the wisdom of God, for the preservation and
subsistence of the world by mutual commerce. What the apostle largely discourseth of the former, in 1
Cor. 12 may be applied to the other. The various conditions of men is also a fruit of Divine wisdom. Some
are rich, and some poor; the rich have as much need of the poor, as the poor have of the rich; if the poor
depend upon the rich for their livelihood, the rich depend upon the poor for their conveniences. Many arts
would not be learned by men, if poverty did not oblige them to it; and many would faint in the learning of
them, if they were not thereunto encouraged by the rich. The poor labor for the rich, as the earth sends
vapors into the vaster and fuller air; and the rich return advantages again to the poor, as the clouds do the
vapors in rain upon the earth. As meat would not afford a flourishing juice without bread, and bread
without other food would immoderately fill the stomach, and not be well digested, so the rich would be
unprofitable in the commonwealth without the poor, and the poor would be burdensome to a
commonwealth without the rich. The poor could not be easily governed without the rich, nor the rich
sufficiently and conveniently provided for without the poor. If all were rich, there would be no objects for
the exercise of a noble part of charity: if all were poor, there were no matter for the exercise of it. Thus the
Divine wisdom planted various inclinations, and diversified the conditions of men for the public
advantages of the world.
</p>
<p>
     2dly. God’s wisdom appears, in the government of men, as fallen and sinful; or, in the government of
sin. After the law of God was broke, and sin invaded and conquered the world, divine wisdom had
another scene to act in, and other methods of government were necessary. The wisdom of God is then
seen in ordering those jarring discords, drawing good out of evil, and honour to himself out of that which
in its own nature tended to the supplanting of his glory. God being a sovereign good, would not suffer so
great an evil to enter, but to serve himself of it for some greater end, for all his thoughts are full of
goodness and wisdom. Now, though the permission of sin be an act of his sovereignty, and the
punishment of sin be an act of his justice, yet the ordination of sin to good, is an act of his wisdom,
whereby he doth dispose the evil, overrules the malice, and orders the events of it to his own purposes.
Sin in itself is a disorder, and therefore God doth not permit sin for itself; for in its own nature it hath
nothing of amiableness, but he wills it for some righteous end, which belongs to the manifestation of his
glory, which is his aim in all the acts of his will; he wills it not as sin, but as his wisdom can order it to
some greater good than was before in the world, and make it contribute to the beauty of the order he
intends. As a dark shadow is not delightful and pleasant in itself, nor is drawn by a painter for any
amiableness there is in the shadow itself, but as it serves to set forth that beauty which is the main design
of his art, so the glorious effects which arise from the entrance of sin into the world, are not from the
creatures evil, but the depths of divine wisdom. Particularly,
</p>
<p>
     1. God’s wisdom is seen in the bounding of sin; as it is said of the wrath of man, it shall praise him,
and the remainder of wrath God doth restrain (Psalm 76:10). He sets limits to the boiling corruption of the
heart, as he doth to the boisterous waves of the sea; “Hitherto shalt thou go, and no further.” As God is the
rector of the world, he doth so restrain sin, so temper and direct it, as that human society is preserved,
which else would be overflown with a deluge of wickedness, and ruin would be brought upon all
communities. The world would be a shambles, a brothel-house, if God, by his wisdom and goodness, did
not set bars to that wickedness which is in the hearts of men: the whole earth would be as bad as hell.
Since the heart of man is a hell of corruption, by that the souls of all men would be excited to the acting
the worst villanies; since “every thought of the heart of man is only evil, and that continually” Gen. 6:5).
If the wisdom of God did not stop these floodgates of evil in the hearts of men, it would overflow the
world, and frustrate all the gracious designs he carries on among the sons of men. Were it not for this
wisdom, every house would be filled with violence, as well as every nature is with sin. What harm would
not strong and furious beasts do, did not the skill of man tame and bridle them? How often hath Divine
wisdom restrained the viciousness of human nature, and let it run, not to that point they designed, but to
the end he purposed! Laban’s fury, and Esau’s enmity against Jacob, were pent in within bounds for
Jacob’s safety, and their hearts overruled from an intended destruction of the good man, to a perfect amity
(Gen. 31:29, and Gen. 31:32.)
</p>
<p>
     2. God’s wisdom is seen in the bringing glory to himself out of sin.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) Out of sin itself. God erects the trophies of honor upon that which is a natural means to hinder and
deface it. His glorious attributes are drawn out to our view, upon the occasion of sin, which otherwise had
lain hid in his own Being. Sin is altogether black and abojuinable; but by the admirable wisdom of God,
he hath drawn out of the dreadful darkness of sin the saving beams of his mercy, and displayed his grace
in the incarnation and passion of his Son for the atonement of sin. Thus he permitted Adam’s fall, and
wisely ordered it, for a fuller discovery of his own nature, and a higher elevation of man’s good, that “as
sin reigned to death, so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ” (Rom.
5:21). The unbounded goodness of God could not have appeared without it. His goodness in rewarding
innocent obedience would have been manifested; but not his mercy, in pardoning rebellious crimes. An
innocent creature is the object of the rewards of grace, as the standing angels are under the beams of
grace; but not under the beams of mercy, because they were never sinful, and, consequently, never
miserable. Without sin the creature had not been miserable: had man remained innocent, he had not been
the subject of punishment; and without the creature’s misery, God’s mercy in sending his Son to save his
enemies, could not have appeared. The abundance of sin is a passive occasion for God to manifest the
abundance of his grace. The power of God in the changing the heart of a rebellious creature, had not
appeared, had not sin infected our nature. We had not clearly known the vindictive justice of God, had no
crime been committed; for that is the proper object of Divine wrath. The goodness of God could never
have permitted justice to exercise itself upon an innocent creature, that was not guilty either personally or
by imputation (Psalm 11:7), “The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth uphold the
upright.” Wisdom is illustrious hereby. God suffered man to fall into a mortal disease, to shew the virtue
of his own restoratives to cure sin, which in itself is incurable by the art of any creature. And otherwise
this perfection, whereby God draws good out of evil, had been utterly useless, and would have been
destitute of an object wherein to discover itself. Again, wisdom, in ordering a rebellious head-strong
world to its own ends, is greater than the ordering an innocent world, exactly observant of his precepts,
and complying with the end of the creation. Now, without the entrance of sin, this wisdom had wanted a
stage to act upon. Thus God raised the honor of this wisdom, while man ruined the integrity of his nature;
and made use of the creature’s breach of his divine law, to establish the honor of it in a more signal and
stable manner, by the active and passive obedience of the Son of his bosom. Nothing serves God so much,
as an occasion of glorifying himself, as the entrance of sin into the world; by this occasion God
communicates to us the knowledge of those perfections of his nature, which had else been folded up from
us in an eternal night; his justice had lain in the dark, as having nothing to punish; his mercy had been
obscure, as having none to pardon; a great part of his wisdom had been silent, as having no such object to
order.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) His wisdom appears, in making use of sinful instruments. He uses the malice and enmity of the
devil to bring about his own purposes, and makes the sworn enemy of his honor contribute to the
illustrating of it against his will. This great craftsmaster he took in his own net, and defeated the devil by
the devil’s malice; by turning the contrivances he had hatched and accomplished against man, against
himself. He used him as a tempter, to grapple with our Saviour in the wilderness, whereby to make him fit
to succor us; and as the god of this world, to conspire the wicked Jews to crucify him, whereby to render
him actually the Redeemer of the world, and so make him an ignorant instrument of that divine glory he
designed to ruin. It is more skill to make a curious piece of workmanship with ill-conditioned tools, than
with instruments naturally fitted for the work: it is no such great wonder for a limner to draw an exact
piece with a fit pencil and suitable colors, as to begin and perfect a beautiful work with a straw and water,
things improper for such a design.783 This wisdom of God is more admirable and astonishing than if a
man were able to rear a vast palace by fire, whose nature is to consume combustible matter not to erect a
building. To make things serviceable contrary to their own nature, is a wisdom peculiar to the Creator of
Nature. God’s making use of devils, for the glory of his name, and the good of his people, is a more
amazing piece of wisdom than his goodness in employing the blessed angels in his work. To promise, that
the world, (which includes the god of the world, and death, and things present, let them be as evil as they
will, should be ours, that is, for our good, and for his glory, is an act of goodness; but to make them
serviceable to the honor of Christ, and the good of his people, is a wisdom that may well raise our highest
admirations: they are for believers, as they are for the glory of Christ, and as Christ is for the glory of God
(1 Cor. 3:22). To chain up Satan wholly, and frustrate his wiles, would be an argument of Divine
goodness; but to suffer him to run his risk, and then improve all his contrivances for his own glorious and
gracious ends and purposes, manifests, besides his power and goodness, his wisdom also. He uses the sins
of evil instruments for the glory of his justice (Isa. 10:5–7). Thus he served himself of the ambition and
covetousness of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Romans, for the correction of his people, and punishment
of his rebels, just as the Roman magistrates used the fury of lions and other wild beasts, in their theatres,
for the punishment of criminals: the lions acted their natural temper in tearing those that were exposed to
them for a prey; but the intent of the magistrates was to punish their crimes. The magistate inspired not
the lions with their rage, that they had from their natures; but served themselves of that natural rage to
execute justice.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) God’s wisdom is seen in bringing good to the creature out of sin. He hath ordered sin to such an
end as man never dreamt of, the devil never imagined, and sin in its own nature could never attain. Sin in
its own nature tends to no good, but that of punishment, whereby the creature is brought into order. It hath
no relation to the creatures good in itself, but to the creature’s mischief: but God, by an act of infinite
wisdom, brings good out of it to the creature, as well as glory to his name, contrary to the nature of the
crime, the intention of the criminal, and the design of the tempter. God willed sin, that is, he willed to
permit it, that he might communicate himself to the creature in the most excellent manner. He willed the
permission of sin, as an occasion to bring forth the mystery of the incarnation and passion of our Saviour;
as he permitted the sin of Joseph’s brethren, that he might use their evil to a good end. He never, because
of his holiness, wills sin as an end; but in regard of his wisdom he wills to permit it as a means and
occasion; and thus, to draw good out of those things which are in their own nature most contrary to good,
is the highest pitch of wisdom.
</p>
<p>
     [1.] The redemption of man in so excellent a way, was drawn from the occasion of sin. The greatest
blessing that ever the world was blessed with, was ushered in by contraieties, by the lust and irregular
affection of man; the first promise of the Redeemer by the fall of Adam (Gen. 3:15), and the bruising the
heel of that promised Seed, by the blackest tragedy acted by wicked rebels, the treachery of Judas, and the
rage of the Jews; the highest good hath been brought forth by the greatest wickedness. As God out of the
chaos of rude and indigested matter framed the first creation; so from the sins of men, and malice of
Satan, he hath erected the everlasting scheme of honor in a new creation of all things by Jesus Christ. The
devil inspired man, to content his own fury in the death of Christ; and God ordered it to accomplish his
own design of redemption in the passion of the Redeemer; the devil had his diabolical ends, and God
overpowers his actions to serve his own divine ends. The person that betrayed him was admitted to be a
spectator of the most private actions of our Saviour, that his innocence might be justified; to shew, that he
was not afraid to have his enemies judges of his most retired privacies. While they all thought to do their
own wills, Divine wisdom orders them to do God’s will (Acts 2:23): “Him, being delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and
slain.” And wherein the crucifiers of Christ sinned, in shedding the richest blood, apon their repentance
they found the expiation of their crimes, and the discovery of a superabundant mercy. Nothing but the
blood was aimed at by them: the best blood was shed by them; but infinite Wisdom makes the cross the
scene of his own righteousness, and the womb of man’s recovery. By the occasion of man’s lapsed state,
there was a way open to raise man to a more excellent condition than that whereinto he was put by
creation: and the depriving man of the happiness of an earthly paradise, in a way of justice, was an
occasion of advancing him to a heavenly felicity, in a way of grace. The violation of the old covenant
occasionally introduced a better the loss of the first integrity ushered in a more stable righteousness, an
everlasting righteousness (Dan. 9:24). And the falling of the first head was succeeded by one whose
standing could not but be eternal. The fall of the devil was ordered by infinite Wisdom, for the good of
that body from which he fell. It is supposed by some, that the devil was the chief angel in heaven, the
head of all the rest; and that he falling, the angels were left as a body without a head; and after he had
politically beheaded the angels, he endeavored to destroy man, and rout him out of paradise; but God
takes the opportunity to set up his Son, as the head of angels and men. And thus whilst the devil
endeavored to spoil the corporation of angels, and make them a body contrary to God, God makes angels
and men one body under one head, for his service. The angels in losing a defectible head, attained a more
excellent and glorious Head in another nature, which they had not before; though of a lower nature in his
humanity, yet of a more glorious nature in his divinity: from whence many suppose they derive their
confirming grace, and the stability of their standing. “All things in heaven and earth are gathered together
in Christ” (Eph 1:10), ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι, all united in him, and reduced under one head: that though our
Saviour be not properly their Redeemer, for redemption supposeth captivity, yet in some sense he is their
Head and Mediator: so that now the inhabitants of heaven and earth are but one family (Eph. 3:15.) And
the innumerable company of angels are parts of that heavenly and triumphant Jerusalem, and that general
assembly, whereof Jesus Christ is Mediator (Heb. 12:22, 29.)
</p>
<p>
     [2.] The good of a nation often, by the skill of Divine wisdom, is promoted by the sins of some men.
The patriarchs’ selling Joseph to the Midianites (Gen. 37:28), was without question a sin, and a breach of
natural affection; yet, by God’s wise ordination, it proved the safety of the whole church of God in the
world, as well as the Egyptian nation (Gen. 45:5, 8; 50:20.) The Jews’ unbelief was a step whereby the
Gentiles arose to the knowledge of the gospel; as the setting of the sun in one place is the rising of it in
another (Matt. 22:9.) He uses the corruptions of men instrumentally to propogate his gospel: he built up
the true church by the preaching of some out of envy (Phil. 1:15), as he blessed Israel out of the mouth of
a false prophet (Num. 23.) How often have the heresies of men been the occasion of clearing up the truth
of God, and fixing the more lively impressions of it on the hearts of believers! Neither Judah nor Tamar,
in their lust, dreamt of a stock for the Redeemer; yet God gave a son from that unlawful bed, whereof
“Christ came according to the flesh” (Gen. 38:29, compared with Matt. 1:3). Jonah’s sin was probably the
first and remote occasion of the Ninevites giving credit to his prophecy; his sin was the cause of his
punishment, and his being flung into the sea might facilitate the reception of his message, and excite the
Ninevites’ repentance, whereby a cloud of severe judgment was blown away from them. It is thought by
some, that when Jonah passed through the streets of Nineveh, with his proclamation of destruction, he
might be known by some of the mariners of that ship, from whence he was cast overboard into the sea,
and might, after their voyage, be occasionally in that city, the metropolis of the nation, and the place of
some of their births; and might acquaint the people, that this was the same person they had cast into the
sea, by his own consent, for his acknowledged running from the presence of the Lord: for that he had told
them (Jonah 1:10); and the mariner’s prayer (ver. 14) evidenced it; whereupon they might conclude his
message worthy of belief, since they knew from such evidences, that he had sunk into the bowels of the
waters, and now saw him safe in their streets, by a deliverence unknown to them; and that therefore that
power that delivered him, could easily verify his word in the threatened judgment. Had Jonah gone at
first, without committing that sin, and receiving that punishment, his message had not been judged a
divine prediction, but a fruit of some enthusiastic madness; his sin upon this account was the first
occasion of averting a judgment from so great a city.
</p>
<p>
     [3.] The good of the sinner himself is sometimes promoted by Divine wisdom ordering the sin. As
God had not permitted sin to enter upon the world, unless to bring glory to himself by it; so he would not
let sin remain in the little world of a believers heart, if he did not intend to order it for his good. What is
done by man, to his damage and disparagement, is directed by Divine wisdom to his advantage; not that it
is the intent of the sin, or the sinner; but it is the event of the sin, by the ordination of Divine wisdom and
grace. As without the wisdom of God permitting sin to enter into the world, some attributes of God had
not been experimentally known, so some graces could not have been exercised; for where had there been
an object for that noble zeal, in vindicating the glory of God, had it not been invaded by an enemy? The
intenseness of love to him could not have been so strong, had we not an enemy to hate for his sake. Where
had there been any place for that noble part of charity in holy admonitions and compassion to the souls of
our neighbors, and endeavors to reduce them out of a destructive, to a happy path? Humility would not
have had so many grounds for its growth and exercise, and holy sorrow had no fuel. And as without the
appearance of sin there had been no exercise of the patience of God, so without afflictions, the fruits of
sin, there had been no ground for the exercise of the patience of a christian, one of the noblest parts of
valor. Now sin being evil, and such as cannot but be evil, hath no respect in itself to any good, and cannot
work a gracious end, or anything profitable to the creature; nay it is a hindrance to any good, and,
therefore, what good comes from it, is accidental; occasioned, indeed, by sin, but efficiently caused by the
over-ruling wisdom of God, taking occasion thereby to display itself and the Divine goodness.
</p>
<p>
     1. The sins and corruptions remaining in the heart of man, God orders for good; and there are good
effects by the direction of his wisdom and grace, as the soul respects God.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) God often brings forth a sensibleness of the necessity of dependence on him. The nurse often lets
the child slip, that it may the better know who supports it, and may not be too venturous and confident of
its own strength. Peter would trust in habitual grace, and God suffers him to fall, that he might trust more
in assisting grace (Matt. 26:35: “Though I should die with thee, yet I will not deny thee.” God leaves
sometimes the brightest souls in eclipse, to manifest that their holiness, and the preservation of it, depend
upon the darting out his beams upon them. As the falls of men are the effects of their coldness and
remissness in acts of faith and repentance, so the fruit of these falls is often a running to him for refuge,
and a deeper sensibleness where their security lies. It makes us lower our swelling sails, and come under
the lee and protection of Divine grace. When the pleasures of sin answer not the expectations of a revolted
creature, he reflects upon his former state, and sticks more close to God, when before God had little of his
company (Hos.2:7): “I will return to my first husband, for then it was better with me t an now.” As God
makes the sins of men sometimes an occasion of their conversion, so he sometimes makes them an
occasion of a further conversion. Onesimus run from Philemon, and was met with by Paul, who proved an
instrument of his conversion (Philem. 10): “My son, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.” His
flight from his master was the occasion of his regeneration by Paul, a prisoner. The falls of believers God
orders to their further stability; he that is fallen for want of using his staff, will lean more upon it to
preserve himself from the like disaster. God, by permitting the lapses of men, doth often make them
despair of their own strength to subdue their enemies, and rely upon the strength of Christ, wherein God
hath laid up power for us, and so becomes stronger in that strength which God hath ordained for them. We
are very apt to trust in ourselves, and have confidence in our own worth and strength; and God lets loose
corruptions to abate this swelling humor. This was the reason of the apostle Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” (2
Cor. 12:7); whether it were a temptation, or corruption, or sickness, that he might be sensible of his own
inability, and where the sufficiency of grace for him was placed. He that is in danger of drowning, and
hath the waves come over his head, will, with all the might he hath, lay hold upon anything near him,
which is capable to save him. God lets his people sometimes sink into such a condition, that they may lay
the faster hold on him who is near to all that call upon him.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) God hereby raiseth higher estimations of the value and virtue of the blood of Christ. As the great
reason why God permitted sin to enter into the world, was to honor himself in the Redeemer, so the
continuance of sin, and the conquests it sometimes makes in renewed men, are to honor the infinite value
and virtue of the Redeemer’s merit, which God, from the beginning, intended to magnify the value of it,
in taking off so much successive guilt; and the virtue of it, in washing away so much daily filth. The
wisdom of God hereby keeps up the credit of imputed righteousness, and manifests the immense treasure
of the Redeemer’s merit to pay such daily debts. Were we perfectly sanctified, we should stand upon our
own bottom, and imagine no need of the continual and repeated imputation of the righteousness of Christ
for our justification: we should confide in inherent righteousness, and slight imputed. If God should take
off all remainders of sin, as well as the guilt of it, we should be apt to forget that we are fallen creatures,
and that we had a Redeemer; but the relics of sin in us mind us of the necessity of some higher strength to
set us right: they mind us both of our own misery, and the Redeemer’s perpetual benefit. God, by this,
keeps up the dignity and honor of our Saviour’s blood to the height, and therefore sometimes lets us see,
to our own cost, what filth yet remains in us for the employment of that blood, which we should else but
little think of, and less admire. Our gratitude is so small to God as well as man, that the first obligations
are soon forgot if we stand not in need of fresh ones successively to second them; we should lose our
thankful remembrance of the first virtue of Christ’s blood in washing us, if our infirmities did not mind us
of fresh reiterations and applications of it. Our Saviour’s office of advocacy was erected especially for
sins committed after a justified and renewed state (1 John 2:1). We should scarce remember we had an
Advocate, and scarce make use of him without some sensible necessity; but our remainders of sin
discover our impotency, and an impossibility for us either to expiate our sin, or conform to the law, which
necessitates us to have recourse to that person whom God hath appointed to make up the breaches
between God and us. So the apostle wraps up himself in the covenant of grace and his interest in Christ,
after his conflict with sin (Rom. 7. ult.), “I thank God, through Jesus Christ.” Now, after such a body of
death, a principle within me that sends up daily steams, yet as long as I serve God with my mind, as long
as I keep the main condition of the covenant, “there is no condemnation” (Rom. 8:1): Christ takes my
part, procures my acceptance, and holds the band of salvation firm in his hands. The brightness of Christ’s
grace is set off by the darkness of our sin. We should not understand the sovereignty of his medicines, if
there were no relics of sin for him to exercise his skill upon: the physician’s art is most experimented, and
therefore most valued in relapses, as dangerous as the former disease. As the wisdom of God brought our
Saviour into temptation, that he might have compassion to us, so it permits us to be overcome by
temptation, that we might have due valuations of him.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) God hereby often engageth the soul to a greater industry for his gory. The highest persecutors,
when they have become converts have been the greatest champions for that cause they both hated and
oppressed. The apostle Paul is such an instance of this, that it needs no enlargement. By how much they
have failed of answering the end of their creation in glorifying God, by so much the more they summon
up all their force for such an end, after their conversion; to restore as much as they can of that glory to
God, which they, by their sin, had robbed him of. Their sins, by the order of Divine wisdom, prove
whetstones to sharpen the edge of their spirits for God. Paul never remembered his persecuting fury, but
he doubled his industry for the service of God, which before he trampled under his feet. The further we go
back, the greater leap many times we take forward. Our Saviour, after his resurrection, put Peter upon the
exercise of that love to him, which had so lately shrunk his head out of suffering (John 21:15–17); and no
doubt, but the consideration of his base denial, together with a reflection upon a gracious pardon, engaged
his ingenuous soul to stronger and fiercer flames of affection. A believer’s courage for God is more
sharpened oftentimes by the shame of his fall: lie endeavors to repair the faults of his ingratitude and his
disingenuity by larger and stronger steps of obedience; as a man in a fight, having been foiled by his
enemy, reassumes new courage by his fall, and is many times obliged to his foil, both for his spirit and his
victory. A gracious heart will, upon the very motions to sin, double its vigor, as well as by good ones: it is
usually more quickened, both in its motion to God and for God, by the temptations and motions to sin
which run upon it. This is another good the wisdom of God brings forth from sin.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) Again, humility towards God is another good Divine wisdom brings forth from the occasion of
sin. By this God beats down all good opinion of ourselves. Hezekiah was more humbled by his fall into
pride, than by all the distress he had been in by Sennacherib’s army (2 Chron. 32:26). Peter’s confidence
before his fall, gave way to an humble modesty after it; you see his confidence (Mark 14:24). “Though all
should be offended in thee, yet will not I;” and you have the mark of his modesty (John 21:17). It is not
then, Lord, I will love thee to the death, I will not start from thee; but, “Lord, thou knowest that I love
thee:” I cannot assure myself of anything after this miscarriage; but, Lord, thou knowest there is a
principle of love in me to thy name. He was ashamed, that himself who appeared such a pillar, should
bend as meanly as a shrub to a temptation. The reflection upon sin lays a man as low as hell in his
humiliation, as the commission of sin did in the merit. When David comes to exercise repentance for his
sin, he begins it from the well-head of sin (Psalm 51:5), his original corruption, and draws down the
streams of it to the last commission; perhaps he did not so seriously, humble himself for the sin of his
nature all his days, so much as at that time; at least, we have not such evidences of it. And Hezekiah
humbled himself for the pride of his heart; not only for the pride of his act (2 Chron. 32:26), but for the
pride in the heart, which was the spring of that pride in act, in showing his treasures to the Babylonish
ambassadors. God lets sin continue in the hearts of the best in this world, and sometimes gives the reins to
Satan, and a man’s own corruption, to keep up a sense of the ancient sale we made of ourselves to both.
</p>
<p>
     2. In regard of ourselves. Herein is the wonder of Divine wisdom, that God many times makes a sin,
which meritoriously fits us for hell, a providential occasion to fit us for heaven; when it is an occasion of
a more humble faith and believing humility, and an occasion of a thorough sanctification and growth in
grace, which prepares us for a state of glory.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) He makes use of one sin’s breaking out to discover more; and so brings us to a self-abhorrency
and indignation against sin, the first step towards heaven. Perhaps David, before his gross fall, thought he
had no hypocrisy in him. We often find him appealing to God for his integrity, and desiring God to try
him, if any guile could be found in his heart, as if he could find none himself; but his lapse into that great
wickedness makes him discern much falseness in his soul, when he desires God to renew a right spirit
within him, and speaks of truth in the inward parts (Psalm 51:6, 10). The stirring of corruption makes all
the mud at the bottom appear, which before a soul did not suspect. No man would think there were so
great a cloud of smoke contained in a little stick of wood, were it not for the powerful operation of the
fire, that both discovers and separates it. Job, that cursed the day of his birth, and uttered many impatient
expressions against God upon the account of his own integrity; upon his recovery from his affliction, and
God’s close application of himself, was wrought to a greater abhorrency of himself than ever we read he
was exercised in before (Job 42:6). The hostile acts of sin increase the soul’s hatred of it; and the deeper
our humiliations are for it, the stronger impressions of abhorrency are made upon us.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) He often orders it, to make conscience more tender, and the soul more watchful. He that finds by
his calamity his enemy to have more strength against him than he suspected, will double his guards, and
quicken his diligence against him. A being overtaken by some sin, is, by the wisdom of God, disposed to
make us more fearful of cherishing any occasion to inflame it, and watchful against every motion and start
of it. By a fall, the soul hath more experience of the deceitfulness of the heart; and by observing its
methods, is rendered better able to watch against them. It is our ignorance of the devices of Satan, and our
own hearts, that makes us obnoxious to their surprises. A fall into one sin is often a prevention of more
which lay in wait for us; as the fall of a small body into an ambush prevents the design of the enemy upon
a greater: as God suffers heresies in the church, to try our faith, so he suffers sins to remain, and
sometimes to break out, to try our watchfulness. This advantage he brings from them, to steel our
resolutions against the same sins, and quicken our circumspection for the future against new surprises by
a temptation. David’s sin was ever before him (Psalm 51:3), and made his conscience cry, Blood, blood!
upon every occasion: he refused the water of the well of Bethlehem (2 Sam. 23:16, 17), because it was
gained with the hazard of lives: he could endure nothing that had the taste of blood in it. Our fear of a
thing depends much upon a trial of it: a child will not fear too near approaches to the fire till he feels the
smart of it. Mortification doth not wholly suppress the motions of sin, though it doth the resolutions to
commit it; but that there will be a proneness in the relics of it, to entice a man into those faults, which,
upon sight of their blemishes, cost him so many tears; as great sicknesses, after the cure, are more
watched, and the body humored, that a man might not fall from the craziness they have left in him, which
he is apt to do if relapses are not provided against. A man becomes more careful of anything that may
contribute to the resurrection of an expired disease.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) God makes it an occasion of the mortification of that sin which was the matter of the fall. The
liveliness of one sin, in a renewed man, many times is the occasion of the death of it. A wild beast, while
kept close in a den, is secure in its life, but when it breaks out to rapine, it makes the master resolve to
prevent any further mischief by the death of it. The impetuous stirring of a humor, in a disease, is
sometimes critical, and a prognostic of the strength of nature against it, whereby the disease loses its
strength, by its struggling, and makes room for health to take place by degrees. One sin is used by God for
the destruction both of itself and others, as the flesh of a scorpion cures the biting of it. It sometimes, by
wounding us, loseth its sting, and, like the bee, renders itself incapable of a second revenge. Peter, after
his gross denial, never denied his Master afterwards. The sin that lay undiscovered, is, by a fall, become
visible, and so more obvious to a mortifying stroke. The soul lays the faster hold on Christ and the
promise, and goes out against that enemy, in the name of that Lord of Hosts, of which he was too
negligent before; and, therefore, as he proves more strong, so more successful: he hath more strength,
because he hath less confidence in himself, and more in God, the prime strength of his soul. As it was
with Christ, so it is with us; while the devil was bruising his heel, he was bruising his head; and while the
devil is bruising our heel, the God of peace and wisdom is sometimes bruising his head, both in us and for
us, so that the strugglings of sin are often as the faint groans or bitings of a beast that is ready to expire. It
is just with a man, sometimes, as with a running fountain that hath mud at the bottom, when it is stirred
the mud tinctures and defiles it all over; yet some of that mud hath a vent with the streams which run from
it, so that, when it is re-settled at the bottom, it is not so much in quantity as it was before. God, by his
wisdom, weakens the sin by permitting it to stir and defile.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) Sometimes Divine wisdom makes it an occasion to promote a sanctification in all parts of the
soul. As the working of one ill-humor in the body is an occasion of cashiering, not only that, but the rest,
by a sound purge; as a man, that is a little cold, doth not think of the fire, but if he slips with one foot into
an icy puddle, he hastens to the fire, whereby not only that part, but all the rest receive a warmth and
strength upon that occasion; or, as if a person fall into the mire, his clothes are washed, and by that means
cleansed, not only from the filth at present contracted, but from the former spots that were before
unregarded. God, by his wisdom, brings secret sins to a discovery, and thereby cleanseth the soul of them.
David’s fall might be ordered as an answer to his former petition (Psalm 19:12): “Cleanse thou me from
my secret sins;” and as he did earnestly pray after his fall, so no doubt but he endeavored a thorough
sanctification (Psalm 51:7); “Purge me, wash me;” and that he meant not only a sanctification from that
single sin, but from all, root and branch, is evident by that complaint of the flaw in his nature (ver. 5): the
dross and chaff which lies in the heart is hereby discovered, and an opportunity administered of throwing
it out, and searching all the corners of the heart to discover where it lay. As God sometimes takes
occasion from one sin to reckon with men, in a way of justice, for others, so he sometimes takes occasion,
from the commission of one sin, to bring out all the actions against the sinner, to make him, in a way of
gracious wisdom, set more cordially upon the work of sanctification. A great fall sometimes hath been the
occasion of a man’s conversion. The fall of mankind occasioned a more blessed restoration; and the falls
of particular believers ofttimes occasion a more extensive sanctification. Thus the only wise God makes
poisons in nature to become medicines in a way of grace and wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) Hereby the growth in grace is furthered. It is a wonder of Divine wisdom, to subtract sometimes
grace from a person, and let him fall into sin, thereby to occasion the increase of habitual grace in him,
and to augment it by those ways that seemed to depress it. By making sins an occasion of a more vigorous
acting, the contrary grace, the wisdom of God, makes our corruptions, in their own nature destructive, to
become profitable to us. Grace often breaks out more strongly afterwards, as the sun doth with its heat,
after it hath been masked and interrupted with a mist: they often, through the mighty working of the
Spirit, make us more humble, and “humility fits us to receive more grace from God” (James 4:6). How
doth faith, that sunk under the waves, lift up its head again, and carry the soul out with a greater
liveliness! What ardors of love, what floods of repenting tears, what severity of revenge, what horrors at
the remembrance of the sin, what trcmblings at the appearance of a second temptation! so that grace
seems to be awakened to a new and more vigorous life (2 Cor. 7:11). The broken joint is many times
stronger in the rupture than it was before. The luxuriancy of the branches of corruption is an occasion of
purging, and purging is with a design to make grace more fruitful (John 15:2); “He purgeth it, that it may
bring forth more fruit.” Thus Divine wisdom doth both sharpen and brighten us by the dust of sin, and
ripen and mellow the fruits of grace by the dung of corruption. Grace grows the stronger by opposition, as
the fire burns hottest and clearest when it is most surrounded by a cold air; and our natural heat reassumes
a new strength by the coldness of the winter. The foil under a diamond, though an imperfection in itself,
increaseth the beauty and lustre of the stone. The enmity of man was a commendation of the grace of
God: it occasioned the breaking out of the grace of God upon us; and is an occasion, by the wisdom and
grace of God, of the increase of grace many times in us. How should the consideration of God’s
incomprehensible wisdom, in the management of evil, swallow us up in admiration who brings forth such
beauty, such eminent discoveries of himself, such excellent good to the creature, out of the bowels of the
greatest contrarieties, making dark shadows serve to display and beautify, to our apprehensions, the
Divine glory! If evil were not in the world, men would not know what good is; they would not behold the
lustre of Divine wisdom, as without night we could not understand the beauty of the day. Though God is
not the author of sin, because of his holiness, yet he is the administrator of sin by his wisdom, and
accomplisheth his own purposes, by the iniquities of his enemies, and the lapses and infirmities of his
friends. Thus much for the Second, the government of man in his lapsed state, and the government of sin,
wherein the wisdom of God doth wonderfully appear.
</p>
<p>
    3dly. The wisdom of God appears in the government of man in his conversion and return to him. If
there be a counsel in framing the lowest creature, and in the minutest passages of providence, there must
needs be a higher wisdom in the government of the creature to a supernatural end, and framing the soul to
be a monument of his glory. The wisdom of God is seen with more admirations, and in more varieties, by
the angels, in the church than in the creation (Eph. 3:10); that is, in forming a church out of the rubbish of
the world, out of contrarieties and contradictions to him, which is greater than the framing a celestial and
elementary world out of a rude chaos. The most glorious bodies in the word, even those of the sun, moon,
and stars, have not such stamps of Divine skill upon them as the soul of man; nor is there so much of
wisdom in the fabric and faculties of that, as in the reduction of a blind, wilful, rebellious soul, to its own
happiness, and God’s glory (Eph. 1:11, 12); “He worketh all things according to the counsel of his own
will, that we should be for the praise of his glory.” If all things, then this, which is none of the least of his
works; to the praise of the glory of his goodness in his work, and to the praise of the rule of his work, his
counsel, in both the act of his will, and the act of his wisdom. The restoring of the beauty of the soul, and
its fitness for its true end, speaks no less wisdom than the first draught of it in creation: and the
application of redemption, and bringing forth the fruits of it, is as well an act of his prudence, as the
contrivance was of his counsel. Divine wisdom appears,
</p>
<p>
     1. In the subjects of conversion. His goodness reigns in the very dust, and he erects the walls and
ornaments of his temple from the clay and mud of the world. He passes over the wise, and noble, and
mighty, that may retend some grounds of boasting in their own natural or acquire endowments; and
pitches upon the most contemptible materials, wherewith to build a spiritual tabernacle for himself (1 Cor.
1:26, 27), “the foolish, and weak things of the world;” those that are naturally most unfit for it, and most
refractory to it. Herein lies the skill of an architect, to render the most knotty, crooked, and inform pieces,
by his art, subservient to his main pur pose and design. Thus God hath ordered, from the beginning of the
world, contrary tempers, various humors, diverse nations, as stones of several natures. to be a building for
himself, fitly framed together, and to be his own family (1 Cor. 3:9). Who will question the skill that
alters a black jet into a clear crystal, a glow-worm into a star, a lion into a lamb, and a swine into a dove?
The more intricate and knotty any business is, the more eminent is any man’s ability and prudence, in
untying the knots and bringing it to a good issue. The more desperate the disease, the more admirable is
the physician’s skill in the cure. He pitches upon men for his service, who have natural dispositions to
serve him in such ways as he disposeth of them, after their conversion: so Paul was naturally a
conscientious man; what he did against Christ was from the dictates of an erroneous conscience, soaked in
the Pharisaical interpretations of the Jewish law: he had a strain of zeal to prosecute what his depraved
reason and conscience did inform him in. God pitches upon this man, and works him in the fire for his
service. He alters not his natural disposition, to make him of a constitution and temper contrary to what he
was before; but directs it to another object, claps in another bias into the bowl, and makes his ill-governed
dispositions move in a new way of his own appointment, and guides that natural heat to the service of that
interest which he was before ambitious to extirpate; as a high-mettled horse, when left to himself, creates
both disturbance and danger, but under the conduct of a wise rider, moves regularly; not by a change of
his natural fierceness, but a skilful management of the beast to the rider’s purpose.
</p>
<p>
     2. In the means of conversion. The prudence of man consists in the timing the executions of his
counsels; and no less doth the wisdom of God consist in this. As he is a God of judgment or wisdom, he
waits to introduce his grace into the soul in the fittest season. This attribute, Paul, in the story of his own
conversion, puts a particular remark upon, which he doth not upon any other; in that catalogue he reckons
up (1 Tim. 1:17), “Now, unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.” A most solemn doxology, wherein wisdom sits upon the throne above all
the rest, with a special Amen to the glory of it, which refers to the timing of his mercy so to Paul, as made
most for the glory of his grace, and the encouragement of others from him as the pattern. God took him at
a time when he was upon the brink of hell; when he was ready to devour the new-born infant church at
Damascus; when he was armed with all the authority from without, and fired with all the zeal from within,
for the prosecution of his design: then God seizeth upon him, and runs him in a channel for his own
honor, and his creatures’ happiness. It is observable784 how God set his eye upon Paul all along in his
furious course, and lets him have the reins, without putting out his hand to bridle him; yet no motion he
could take, but the eye of God runs along with him: he suffered him to kick against the pricks of miracles,
and the convincing discourse of Stephen at his martyrdom. There were many that voted for Stephen’s
death, as the witnesses that flung the stones first at him; but they are not named, only Saul, who testified
his approbation as well as the rest, and that by watching the witnesses’ clothes while they were about that
bloody work (Acts 7:58); “the witnesses laid their clothes at a young man’s feet, named Saul.” Again,
though multitudes were consenting to his death, yet (Acts 8:1) Saul only is mentioned. God’s eye is upon
him, yet he would not at that time stop his fury. He goes on further, and makes “havoc of the church”
(Acts 8:3.) He had surely many more complices, but none are named (as if none regarded with any design
of grace but Saul: yet God would not reach out his hand to change him, but eyes him, waiting for a fitter
opportunity, which in his wisdom he did foresee. And, therefore (Acts 9:1) the Spirit of God adds a yet:
“Saul yet breathing out threatenings.” It was not God’s time yet, but it would be shortly. But, when Saul
was putting in execution his design against the church of Damascus, when the devil was at the top of his
hopes, and Saul in the height of his fury, and the Christians sunk into the depth of their fears, the wisdom
of God lays hold of the opportunity, and by Paul’s conversion at this season, defeats the devil, disappoints
the high priests, shields his people, discharges their fears, by pulling Saul out of the devil’s hands, and
forming Satan’s instruments to a holy activity against him.
</p>
<p>
    3. The wisdom of God appears in the manner of conversion. So great a change God makes, not by a
destruction, but with a preservation of, and suitableness to nature. As the devil tempts us, not by offering
violence to our natures, but by proposing things convenient to our corrupt natures, so doth God solicit us
to a return by proposals suited to our faculties. As he doth in nature convey nourishment to men, by
means of the fruits of the earth, and produceth the fruits of the earth by the influences of heaven; the
influences of heaven do not force the earth, but excite that natural virtue and strength which is in it. So
God produceth grace in the soul by the means of the word, fitted to the capacity of man, as man, and
proportioned to his rational faculties, as rational. It would be contrary to the wisdom of God to move man
like a stone, to invert the order and privilege of that nature which he settled in creation; for then God
would in vain have given man understanding and will: because, without moving man according to those
faculties, they would remain unprofitable and unuseful in man.786 God doth not reduce us to himself, as
logs, by a mere force, or as slaves forced by a cudgel, to go forth to that place, and do that work which
they have no stomach to: but he doth accommodate himself to those foundations he hath laid in our
nature, and guides us in a way agreeable thereunto, by an action as sweet as powerful; clearing our
understandings of dark principles, whereby we may see his truth, our own misery, and the seat of our
happiness; and bending our wills according to this light, to desire and move conveniently to this end of
our calling; efficaciously, yet agreeably; powerfully, yet without imposing on our natural faculties;
sweetly, without violence, in ordering the means; but effectually, without failing, in accomplishing the
end.787 And therefore the Scripture calleth it, teaching (John 6:45), alluring (Hos. 2:15), calling us to seek
the Lord (Psalm 27:8). Teaching is an act of wisdom; alluring, an act of love; calling, an act of authority:
but none of them argue a violent constraint. The principle that moves the will is supernatural; but the will,
as a natural faculty, concurs in the act or motion. God doth not act in this in a way of absolute power,
without an infinite wisdom, suiting himself to the nature of the things he acts upon: he doth not change
the physical nature, though he doth the moral. As in the government of the world, he doth not make heavy
things ascend, nor light things descend, ordinarily, but guides their motions according to their natural
qualities: so God doth not strain the faculties beyond their due pitch. He lets the nature of the faculty
remain, but changes the principle in it: the understanding remains understanding, and the will remains
will. But where there was before folly in the understanding, he puts in a spirit of wisdom; and where there
was before a stoutness in the will, he forms it to a pliableness to his offers. He hath a key to fit every ward
in the lock, and opens the will without injuring the nature of the will. He doth not change the soul by an
alteration of the faculties, but by an alteration of something in them: not by an inroad upon them, or by
mere power, or a blind instinct, but by proposing to the understanding something to be known, and
informing it of the reasonableness of his precepts, and the innate goodness and excellency of his offers,
and by inclining the will to love and embrace what is proposed. And things are proposed under those
notions, which usually move our wills and affections. We are moved by things as they are good, pleasant,
profitable; we entertain things as they make for us, and detest things as they are contrary to us. Nothing
affects us but under such qualities, and God suits his encouragements to these natural affections which are
in us: his power and wisdom go hand in hand together; his power to act what his wisdom orders, and his
wisdom to conduct what his power executes. He brings men to him in ways suited to their natural
dispositions. The stubborn he tears like a lion, the gentle he wins like a turtle, by sweetness; he hath a
hammer to break the stout, and a cord of love to draw the more pliable tempers: be works upon the more
rational in a way of gospel reason; upon the more ingenuous in a way of kindness, and draws them by the
cords of love. The wise men were led to Christ by a star, and means suited to the knowledge and study
that those eastern nations used, which was much in astronomy: he worketh upon others by miracles
accommodated to every one’s sense, and so proportions the means according to the nature of the subjects
he works upon.
</p>
<p>
    4. The wisdom of God is apparent in his discipline and penal evils. The wisdom of human
governments is seen in the matter of their laws, and in the penalties of their laws, and in the proportion of
the punishment to the offence, and in the good that redounds from the punishment either to the offender,
or to the community. The wisdom of God is seen in the penalty of death upon the transgression of his law;
both in that it was the greatest evil that man might fear, and so was a convenient means to keep him in his
due bound, and also in the proportion of it to the transgression. Nothing less could be in a wise justice
inflicted upon an offender for a crime against the highest Being and the Supreme Excellency: but this hath
been spoken of before in the wisdom of his laws. I shall only mention some few; it would be too tedious
to run into all.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) His wisdom appears in judgments, in the suiting them to the qualities of persons, and nature of
sins. He deviseth evil (Jer. 18:11); his judgments are fruits of counsel. “He also is wise, and will bring
evil” (Isa. 31:2),—evil suitable to the person offending, and evil suitable to the offence committed: as the
husbandman doth his threshing instruments to the grain: he hath a rod for the cummin, a tenderer seed,
and a flail for the harder; so hath God greater judgments for the obdurate sinner, and lighter for those that
have something of tenderness in their wickedness (Isa. 28:27, 29): “Because he is wonderful in counsel
and excellent in working;” so some understand the place, “With the froward, he will show himself
froward.” He proportions punishment to the sin, and writes the cause of the judgment in the forehead of
the judgment itself. Sodom burned in lust, and was consumed by fire from heaven. The Jews sold Christ
for thirty pence; and at the taking of Jerusalem, thirty of them were sold for a penny. So Adoni-bezek cut
off the thumbs and great toes of others, and he is served in the same kind (Judges 1:7). The Babel builders
designed an indissoluble union, and God brings upon them an unintelligible confusion. And in Exod. 9:9,
the ashes of the furnace where the Israelites burnt the Egyptian bricks, sprinkled towards heaven, brought
boils upon the Egyptian bodies, that they might feel in their own, what pain they had caused in the
Israelites’ flesh; and find, by the smart of the inflamed scab, what they had made the Israelites endure.
The waters of the river Nilus are turned into blood, wherein they had stifled the breath of the Israelites’
infants: and at last the prince, and the flower of their nobility, are drowned in the Red Sea. It is part of the
wisdom of justice to proportion punishment to the crime, and the degrees of wrath to the degrees of
malice in the sin. Afflictions also are wisely proportioned: God, as a wise physician, considers the nature
of the humor and strength of the patient, and suits his medicines both to the one and the other (1 Cor.
10:13).
</p>
<p>
    (2.) In the seasons of punishments and afflictions. He stays till sin be ripe, that his justice may appear
more equitable, and the offender more inexcusable (Dan. 9:14); he watches upon the evil to bring it apon
men; to bring it in the just season and order for his righteous and gracious purpose; his righteous purpose
on the enemies, and his gracious purpose on his people. Jerusalem’s calamity came upon them, when the
city was full of people at the solemnity of the passover, that he might mow down his enemies at once, and
time their destruction to such a moment wherein they had timed the crucifixion of his Son. He watched
over the clouds of his judgments, and kept them from pouring down, till his people, the Christians, were
provided for, and had departed out of the city to the chambers and retiring places God had provided for
them. He made not Jerusalem the shambles of his enemies, till he had made Pella, and other places, the
arks of his friends. As Pliny tells us, “The evidence of God holds the sea in a calm for fifteen days, that
the halcyons, little birds that frequent the shore, may build their nests, and hatch up their young.” The
judgment apon Sodom was suspended for some hours, till Lot was secured. God suffered not the church
to be invaded by violent persecutions, till she was established in the faith: he would not expose her to so
great combats, while she was weak and feeble, but gave her time to fortify herself, to be rendered more
capable of bearing up under them.788 He stifled all the motions of passion the idolaters might have for
their superstition, till religion was in such a condition, as rather to be increased and purified, than
extinguished by opposition. Paul was secured from Nero’s chains, and the nets of his enemies, till he had
broke off the chain of the devil from many cities of the Gentiles, and catched them by the net of the
gospel out of the sea of the world. Thus the wisdom of God is seen in the seasons of judgments and
afflictions.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) It is apparent in the gracious issue of afflictions and penal evils. It is a part of wisdom to bring
good out of evil of punishment, as well as to bring good out of sin. The church never was so like to
heaven, as when it was most persecuted by hell: the storms often cleansed it and the lance often made it
more healthful. Job’s integrity had not been so clear, nor his patience so illustrious, had not the devil been
permitted to afflict him. God, by his wisdom, outwits Satan; when he by his temptations intends to pollute
us and buffet us, God orders it to purify us; he often brings the clearest light out of the thickest darkness,
makes poisons to become medicines. Death itself, the greatest punishment in this life, and the entrance
into hell in its own nature, he hath by his wise contrivance, made to his people the gate of heaven, and the
passage into immortality.789 Penal evils in a nation often end in a public advantage troubles and wars
among a people are many times not destroying, but medicinal, and cure them of that degeneracy, luxury,
and effeminateness, they contracted by a long peace.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) This wisdom is evident in the various ends which God brings about by afflictions. The attainment
of various ends by one and the same means, is the fruit of the agent’s prudence. By the same affliction,
the wise God corrects sometimes for some base affection, excites some sleepy grace, drives out some
lurking corruption, refines the soul, and ruins the lust; discovers the greatness of a crime, the vanity of the
creature, and the sufficiency in himself. The Jews bind Paul, and by the judge he is sent to Rome; while
his mouth is stopped in Judea, it is opened in one of the greatest cities of the world, and his enemies
unwittingly contribute to the increase of the knowledge of Christ by those chains, in that city (Acts 28:31)
that triumphed over the earth. And his afflictive bonds added courage and resolution to others (Phil. 1:14):
“Many waxing confident by my bonds;” which could not in heir own nature produce such an effect, but
by the order and contrivance of Divine wisdom: in their own nature, they would rather make them disgust
the doctrine he suffered for, and cool their zeal in the propagatlng of it, for fear of the same disgrace and
hardship they saw him suffer.790 But the wisdom of God changed the nature of these fetters, and
conducted them to the glory of his name, the encouragement of others, the increase of the gospel, and the
comfort of the apostle himself (Phil. 1:12, 13, 18). The sufferings of Paul at Rome confirmed the
Philippians, a people at a distance from thence, in the doctrine they had already received at his hands.
Thus God makes sufferings sometimes, which appear like judgments, to be like the viper on Paul’s hand
(Acts 28:6), a means to clear up innocence, and procure favor to the doctrine among those barbarians.
How often hath he multiplied the church by death and massacres, and increased it by those means used to
annihilate it!
</p>
<p>
    (5.) The Divine wisdom is apparent in the deliverances he affords to other parts of the world, as well
as to his church. There are delicate composures, curious threads in his webs, and he works them like an
artificer: a goodness wrought for them, curiously wrought (Psalm 31:19), [1.] In making the creatures
subservient in their natural order to his gracious ends and purposes. He orders things in such a manner, as
not to be necessitated to put forth an extraordinary power in things, which some part of the creation might
accomplish. Miraculous productions would speak his power; but the ordering the natural course of things,
to occasion such effects they were never intended for, is one part of the glory of his wisdom. And that his
wisdom may be seen in the course of nature, he conducts the motions of creatures, and acts them in their
own strength; and doth that by various windings and turnings of them, which he might do in an instant by
his power, in a supernatural way. Indeed, sometimes he hath made invasions on nature, and suspended the
order of their natural laws for a season, to show himself the absolute Lord and Governor of nature: yet if
frequent alterations of this nature were made, they would impede the knowledge of the nature of things,
and be some bar to the discovery and glory of his wisdom, which is best seen by moving the wheels of
inferior creatures in an exact regularity to his own ends. He might, when his little church in Jacob’s family
was like to starve in Canaan, have, for their preservation, turned the stones of the country into bread; but
he sends them down to Egypt to procure corn, that a way might be opened for their removal into that
country; the truth of his prediction in their captivity accomplished, and a way made after the declaration
of his great name, Jehovah, both in the fidelity of his word and the greatness of his power, in their
deliverance from that furnace of affliction. He might have struck Goliath, the captain of the Philistine’s
army, with a thunderbolt from heaven, when he blasphemed his name, and scared his people; but he useth
the natural strength of a stone, and the artificial motion of a sling, by the arm of David, to confront the
giant, and thereby to free Judea from the ravage of a potent enemy. He might have delivered the Jews
from Babylon by as strange miracles as he used in their deliverance from Egypt: he might have plagued
their enemies, gathered his people into a body, and protected them by the bulwark of a cloud and a pillar
of fire, against the assaults of their enemies. But he uses the differences between the Persians and those of
Babylon, to accomplish his ends. How sometimes hath the veering about of the wind on a sudden been the
loss of a navy, when it hath been put upon the point of victory, and driven back the destruction upon those
which intended it for others! and the accidental stumbling, or the natural fierceness of a horse, flung down
a general in the midst of a battle, where he hath lost his life by the throng, and his death hath brought a
defeat to his army, and deliverance to the other party, that were upon the brink of ruin! Thus doth the
wisdom of God link things together according to natural order, to work out his intended preservation of a
people. [2.] In the season of deliverance. The timing of affairs is a part of the wisdom of man, and an
eminent part of the wisdom of God. It is in due season he sends the former and the latter rain, when the
earth is in the greatest indigence, and when his influences may most contribute to the bringing forth and
ripening the fruit. The dumb creatures have their meat from him in due season (Psalm 104:27): and in his
due season have his darling people their deliverance. When Paul was upon his journey to Damascus with
a persecuting commission, he is struck down for the security of the church in that city. The nature of the
lion is changed in due season, for the preservation of the lambs from worrying. The Israelites are
miraculously rescued from Egypt, when their wits were at a loss, when their danger to human
understanding was unavoidable; when earth and sea refused protection, then the wisdom and power of
heaven stepped in to effect that which was past the skill of the conductors of that multitude. And when the
lives of the Jews lay at the stake, and their necks were upon the block at the mercy of their enemies’
swords by an order from Shushan, not only a reprieve, but a triumph, arrives to the Jews, by the wisdom
of God guiding the affair, whereby of persons designed to execution, they are made conquerors, and have
opportunity to exercise their revenge instead of their atience, proving triumphers where they expected to
be sufferers (Esth. 8:9). How strangely doth God, by secret ways, bow the hearts of men and the nature of
things to the execution of that which he designs, notwithstanding all the resistance of that which would
traverse the security of his people! How often doth he trap the wicked in the work of their own bands,
make their confidence to become their ruin, and ensnare them in those nets they wrought and laid for
others (Psalm 9:16)! “The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. He scatters the proud in the
imagination of their hearts” (Luke 1:51), in the height of their hopes, when their designs have been laid so
deep in the foundation, and knit and cemented so close in their superstructure, that no human power or
wisdom could rase them down: he hath then disappointed their projects, and befooled their craft. How
often hath he kept back the fire, when it hath been ready to devour; broke the arrows when they have been
prepared in the bow; turned the spear into the bowels of the bearera, and wounded them at the very instant
they were ready to wound Others! [3.] In suiting instruments to his purpose. He either finds them fit, or
makes them on a sudden fit for his gracious ends. If he hath a tabernacle to build, he will fit a Bezaleel
and an Aholiab with the spirit of wisdom and understanding in all cunning workmanship (Exod. 31:3, 6).
If he finds them crooked pieces, he can, like a wise architect, make them straight beams for the rearing his
house, and for the honor of his name. He sometimes picks out men according to their natural tempers, and
employs them in his work. Jehu, a man of a furious temper, and ambitious spirit, is called out for the
destruction of Ahab’s house. Moses, a man furnished with all Egyptian wisdom, fitted by a generous
education, prepared also by the affliction he met with in his flight, and one who had had the benefit of
conversation with Jethro, a man of more than an ordinary wisdom and goodness, as appears by his
prudent and religious counsel; this man is called out to be the head and captain of an oppressed people,
and to rescue them from their bondage, and settle the first national church in the world. So Elijah, a high-
spirited man, of a hot and angry temper, one that slighted the frowns, and undervalued the favor of
princes, is set up to stem the torrent of Israelitish idolatry. So Luther, a man of the same temper, is drawn
out by the same wisdom to encounter the corruptions in the church, against such opposition, which a
milder temper would have sunk under. The earth, in Rev. 12:16, is made an instrument to help the
woman: when the grandees of that age transferred the imperial power upon Constantine, who became
afterwards a protecting and nursing father to the church, an end which many of his favorers never
designed, nor ever dreamt of: but God, by his infinite wisdom, made these several designs, like several
arrows shot at rovers, meet in one mark to which he directed them, viz., in bringing forth an instrument to
render peace to the world and security and increase to his church.
</p>
<p>
    III. The wisdom of God doth wonderfully appear in redemption. His wisdom in creature ravisheth the
eye and understanding; his wisdom in government doth no less affect a curious observer of the links and
concatenation of the means; but his wisdom in redemption mounts the mind to a greater astonishment.
The works of creation are the footsteps of his wisdom; the wprk of redemption is the face of his wisdom.
A man is better known by the features of his face, than by the prints of his feet. We, with “open face,” or a
revealed face, “beholding the glory of the Lord” (2 Cor. 3:18). Face, there, refers to God, not to us; the
glory of God’s wisdom is now open, and no longer covered and veiled by the shadows of the law. As we
behold the light glorious as scattered in the air before the appearance of the sun, but more gloriously in the
face of the sun when it begins its race in our horizon. All the wisdom of God in creation, and government
in his variety of laws, was like the light the three first days of the creation, dispersed about the world; but
the fourth day it was more glorious, when all gathered into the body of the sun (Gen. 1:4, 16). So the light
of Divine wisdom and glory was scattered about the world, and so more obscure, till the fourth divine day
of the world, about the four thousandth year, it was gathered into one body, the Sun of Righteousness, and
so shone out more gloriously to men and angels. All things are weaker the thinner they are extended, but
stronger the more they are united and compacted in one body and appearance. In Christ, in the
dispensation by him, as well as his person, were “hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col.
2:3). Some doles of wisdom were given out in creation, but the treasures of it opened in redemption, the
highest degrees of it that ever God did exert in the world. Christ is therefore called the “wisdom of God,”
as well as the “power of God” (1 Cor. 1:24); and the gospel is called the “wisdom of God.” Christ is the
wisdom of God principally, and the gospel instrumentally, as it is the power of God instrumentally to
subdue the heart to himself. This is wrapped up in the appointing Christ as Redeemer, and opened to us in
the revelation of it by the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    1. It is a hidden wisdom. In this regard God is said, in the text, to be only wise: and it is said to be a
“hidden wisdom” (1 Tim. 1:17), and “wisdom in a mystery” (1 Cor. 2:7), incomprehensible to the
ordinary capacity of an angel, more than the obstruse qualities of the creatures are to the understanding of
man. No wisdom of men or angels is able to search the veins of this mine, to tell all the threads of this
web, or to understand all the lustre of it; they are as far from an ability fully to comprehend it, as they
were at first to contrive it. That wisdom that invented it can only comprehend it. In the uncreated
understanding only there is a clearness of light without any shadow of darkness. We come as short of full
apprehensions of it, as a child doth of the counsel of the wisest prince. It is so hidden from us, that,
without revelation, we could not have the least imagination of it; and though it be revealed to us, yet,
without the help of an infiniteness of understanding, we cannot fully fathom it: it is such a tractate of
divine wisdom, that the angels never before had seen the edition of it, till it was published to the world
(Eph. 3:10): “to the intent that now unto principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by
the church the manifold wisdom of God.” Now made known to them, not before; and now made known to
them “in the heavenly places.” They had not the knowledge of all heavenly mysteries, though they had the
possession of heavenly glory: they knew the prophecies of it in the word, but attained not a clear
interpretation of those prophecies till the things that were prophesied of came upon the stage.
</p>
<p>
     2. Manifold wisdom: so it is called. As manifold as mysterious: variety in the mystery, and mystery in
every part of the variety. It was not one single act, but a variety of counsels met in it; a conjunction of
excellent ends and excellent means. The glory of God, the salvation of man, the defeat of the apostate
angels, the discovery of the blessed Trinity in their nature, operations, their combined and distinct acts
and expressions of goodness. The means are the conjunction of two natures, infinitely distinct from one
another; the union of eternity and time, of mortality and immortality: death is made the way to life, and
shame the path to glory. The weakness of the cross is the reparation of man, and the creature is made wise
by the “foolishness of preaching;” fallen man grows rich by the poverty of the Redeemer, and man is
filled by the emptiness of God; the heir of hell made a son of God, by God’s taking upon him the “form of
a servant;” the son of man advanced to the highest degree of honor, by the Son of God becoming of “no
reputation.” It is called (Eph. 1:8) “abundance of wisdom and prudence.” Wisdom, in the eternal counsel,
contriving a way; prudence, in the temporary revelation, ordering all affairs and occurrences in the world
for the attaining the end of his counsel. Wisdom refers to the mystery; prudence, to the manifestation of it
in fit ways and convenient seasons. Wisdom, to the contrivance and order; prudence, to the execution and
accomplishment. In all things God acted as became him, as a wise and just Governor of the world (Heb.
2:10). Whether the wisdom of God might not have found out some other way, or whether he were, in
regard of the necessity and naturalness of his justice, limited to this, is not the question; but that it is the
best and wisest way for the manifestation of his glory, is out of question.
</p>
<p>
     This wisdom will appear in the different interests reconciled by it: in the subject, the second person in
the Trinity, wherein they were reconciled: in the two natures, wherein he accomplished it; whereby God is
made known to man in his glory, sin eternally condemned, and the repenting and believing sinner
eternally rescued the honor and righteousness of the law vindicated both in the precept and penalty: the
devil’s empire overthrown by the same nature he had overturned, and the subtilty of hell defeated by that
nature he had spoiled: the creature engaged in the very act to the highest obedience and humility, that, as
God appears as a God upon his throne, the creature might appear in the lowest posture of a creature, in the
depths of resignation and dependence: the publication of this made in the gospel, by ways congruous to
the wisdom which appeared in the execution of his counsel, and the conditions of enjoying the fruit of it,
most wise and reasonable.
</p>
<p>
     1. The greatest different interests are reconciled, justice in punishing, and mercy in pardoning. For
man had broken the law, and plunged himself into a gulf of misery: the sword of vengeance was
unsheathed by justice, for the punishment of the criminal; the bowels of compassion were stirred by
mercy, for the rescue of the miserable. Justice severely beholds the sin, and mercy compassionately
reflects upon the misery. Two different claims are entered by those concerned attributes: justice votes for
destruction, and mercy votes for salvation. Justice would draw the sword, and drench it in the blood of the
offender; mercy would stop the sword, and turn it from the breast of the sinner. Justice would edge it, and
mercy would blunt it. The arguments are strong on both sides.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Justice pleads. I arraign, before thy tribunal, a rebel, who was the glorious work of thy hands, the
centre of thy rich goodness, and a counterpart of thy own image; be is indeed miserable, whereby to excite
thy compassion; but he is not miserable, without being criminal. Thou didst create him in a state, and with
ability to be otherwise: the riches of thy bounty aggravate the blackness of his crime. He is a rebel, not by
necessity, but will. What constraint was there upon him to listen to the counsels of the enemy of God?
What force could there be upon him, since it is without the compass of any creature to work upon, or
constrain the will? Nothing of ignorance can excuse him; the law was not ambiguously expressed, but in
plain words, both as to precept and penalty; it was writ in his nature in legible characters: had he received
any disgust from thee after his creation, it would not excuse his apostasy, since, as a Sovereign, thou wert
not obliged to thy creature. Thou hadst provided all things richly for him; he was crowned with glory and
honor: thy infinite power had bestowed upon him an habitation richly furnished, and varieties of servants
to attend him. Whatever he viewed without, and whatever he viewed within himself, were several marks
of thy Divine bounty, to engage him to obedience: had there been some reason of any disgust, it could not
have balanced that kindness which had so much reason to oblige him: however, he had received no
courtesy from the fallen angel, to oblige him to turn into his camp. Was it not enough, that one of thy
creatures would have stripped thee of the glory of heaven, but this also must deprive thee of thy glory
upon earth, which was due from him to thee as his Creator? Can he charge the difficulty of the command?
No: it was rather below, than above his strength. He might rather complain that it was no higher, whereby
his obedience and gratitude might have a larger scope, and a more spacious field to move in than a precept
so light; so easy, as to abstain from one fruit in the garden. What excuse can he have, that would prefer
the liquorishness of his sense before the dictates of his reason, and the obligations of his creation? The
law thou didst set him was righteous and reasonable; and shall righteousness and reason be rejected by the
supreme and infallible reason, because the rebellious creature hath trampled upon it? What! must God
abrogate his holy law, because the creature hath slighted it? What reflection will this be upon the wisdom
that enacted it, and upon the equity of the command and sanction of it? Either man must suffer, or the
holy law be expunged, and forever out of date. And is it not better man should eternally smart under his
crime, than any dishonorable reflections of unrighteousness be cast upon the law, and of folly, and want
of foresight upon the Lawgiver? Not to punish, would be to approve the devil’s lie, and justify the
creature’s revolt. It would be a condemnation of thy own law as unrighteous, and a sentencing thy own
wisdom as imprudent. Better man should forever bear the punishment of his offence, than God bear the
dishonor of his attributes: better man should be miserable than God should be unrighteous, unwise, false,
and tamely bear the denial of his sovereignty. But what advantage would it be to gratify mercy by
pardomng the malefactor? Besides the irreparable dishonor to the law, the falsifying thy veracity in not
executing the denounced threatenings, he would receive encouragement by such a grace to spurn more at
thy sovereignty, and oppose thy holiness by running on in a course of sin with hopes of impunity. If the
creature be restored, it cannot be expected that he that hath fared so well, after the breach of it, should be
very careful of a future observance: his easy readmission would abet him in the repetition of his offence,
and thou shalt soon find him cast off all moral dependence on thee. Shall he be restored without any
condition, or covenant? He is a creature not to be governed without a law, and a law is not to be enacted
without a penalty. What future regard will he have to thy precept, or what fear will he have of thy
threatening, if his crime be so lightly past over? Is it the stability of thy word? What reason will he have
to give credit to that, which he hath found already disregarded by thyself? Thy truth in future threatenings
will be of no force with him, who hath experienced thy laying it aside in the former. It is necessary,
therefore, that the rebellious creature should be punished for the preservation of the honor of the law, and
the honor of the Lawgiver, with all those perfections that are united in the composure of it.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Mercy doth not want a plea. It is true, indeed, the sin of man wants not its aggravations: he hath
slighted thy goodness, and accepted thy enemy as his counsellor, but it was not a pure act of his own, as
the devil’s revolt was: he had a tempter, and the devil had none: he had, I acknowledge, an understanding
to know thy will, and a power to obey it; yet he was mutable, and had a capacity to fall. It was no difficult
task that was set him, nor a hard yoke that was laid upon him; yet he had a brutish part, as well as a
rational, and sense as well as soul; whereas the fallen angel was a pure intellectual spirit. Did God create
the world to suffer an eternal dishonor, in letting himself be outwitted by Satan, and his work wrested out
of his hands? Shall the work of eternal counsel presently sink into irreparable destruction, and the honor
of an almighty and wise work be lost in the ruin of the creature? This would seem contrary to the nature
of thy goodness, to make man only to render him miserable: to design him in his creation for the service
of the devil, and not for the service of his Creator. What else could be the issue, if the chief work of thy
hand, defaced presently after the erecting, should forever remain in this marred condition? What can be
expected upon the continuance of his misery, but a perpetual hatred, and enmity of thy creature against
thee? Did God in creation design his being hated, or his being loved by his creature? Shall God make a
holy law, and have no obedience to that law from that creature whom it was made to govern? Shall the
curious workmanship of God, and the excellent engravings of the law of nature in his heart, be so soon
defaced, and remain in that blotted condition forever? This fall thou couldst not but in the treasures of thy
in finite knowledge foresee. Why hadst thou goodness then to create him in an integrity, if thou wouldst
not have mercy to pity him in misery? Shall thy enemy forever trample upon the honor of thy work, and
triumph over the glory of God, and applaud himself in the success of his subtilty? Shall thy creature only
passively glorify thee as an avenger, and not actively as a compassionater? Am not I a perfection of thy
nature as well as justice? Shall justice engross all, and I never come into view? It is resolved already, that
the fallen angels shall be no subjects for me to exercise myself upon; and I have now less reason than
before to plead for them: they fell with a full consent of will, without any motion from another; and not
content with their own apostasy they envy thee, and thy glory upon earth, as well as in heaven, and have
drawn into their party the best part of the creation below. Shall Satan lunge the whole creation in the same
irreparable ruin with himself? If the creature be restored, will he contract a boldness in sin by impurity?
Hast thou not a grace to render him ingenuous in obedience, as well as a compassion to recover him from
misery? What will hinder, but that such a grace, which hath established the standing angels, may establish
this recovered creature? If I am utterly excluded from exercising myself on men, as I have been from
devils, a whole species is lost; nay, I can never expect to appear upon the stage: if thou wilt quite ruin him
by justice, and create another world, and another man, if he stand, thy bounty will be eminent, yet there is
no room for mercy to act, unless by the commission of sin, he exposeth himself to misery; and if sin enter
into another world, I have little hopes to be heard then, if I am rejected now. Worlds will be perpetually
created by goodness, wisdom, and power; sin entering into these worlds, will be perpetually punished by
justice; and mercy, which is a perfection of thy nature, will forever be commanded silence, and lie wrapt
up in an eternal darkness. Take occasion now, therefore, to expose me to the knowledge of thy creature,
since without misery, mercy can never set foot into the world. Mercy pleads, if man be ruined, the
creation is in vain; justice pleads, if man be not sentenced, the law is in vain; truth backs justice, and grace
abets mercy. What shall be done in this seeming contradiction? Mercy is not manifested, if man be not
pardoned; justice will complain, if man be not punished.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) An expedient is found out, by the wisdom of God, to answer these demands, and adjust the
differences between them. The wisdom of God answers, I will satisfy your pleas. The pleas of justice shall
be satisfied in punishing, and the pleas of mercy skall be received in pardoning. Justice shall not complain
for want of punishment, nor mercy for want of compassion. I will have an infinite sacrifice to content
justice; and the virtue and fruit of that sacrifice shall delight mercy. Here shall justice have punishment to
accept, and mercy shall have pardon to bestow. The rights of both are preserved, and the demands of both
amicably accorded in punishment and pardon, by transferring the punishment of our crimes upon a surety,
exacting a recompense from his blood by justice, and conferring life and salvation upon us by mercy
without the expense of one drop of our own. Thus is justice satisfied in its severities, and mercy in its
indulgences. The riches of grace are twisted with the terrors of wrath. The bowels of mercy are wound
about the flaming sword of justice, and the sword of justice protects and secures the bowels of mercy.
Thus is God righteous without being cruel, and merciful without being unjust; his righteousness
inviolable, and the world recoverable. Thus is a resplendent mercy brought forth in the midst of all the
curses, confusions, and wrath threatened to the offender. This is the admirable temperament found out by
the wisdom of God: his justice is honored in the sufferings of man’s surety; and his mercy is honored in
the application of the propitiation to the offender (Rom. 3:24, 25): “Being justified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
God.” Had we in our persons been sacrifices to justice, mercy had forever been unknown; had we been
solely fostered by mercy, justice had forever been secluded; had we, being guilty, been absolved, mercy
might have rejoiced, and justice might have complained; had we been solely punished, justice would have
triumphed, and mercy grieved. But by this medium of redemption, neither hath ground of complaint;
justice hath nothing to charge, when the punishment is inflicted; mercy hath whereof to boast when the
surety is accepted. The debt of the sinner is transferred upon the surety, that the merit of the surety may be
conferred upon the sinner; so that God now deals with our sins in a way of consuming justice, and with
our persons in a way of relieving mercy. It is highly better, and more glorious, than if the claim of one had
been granted, with the exclusion of the demand of the other; it had then been either an unrighteous mercy,
or a merciless justice; it is now a righteous mercy, and a merciful justice.
</p>
<p>
     2. The wisdom of God appears in the subject or person wherein these were accorded; the Second
Person is the blessed Trinity. There was a congruity in the Son’s undertaking and effecting it rather than
any other person, according to the order of the persons, and the several functions of the persons, as
represented in Scripture. The Father, after creation, is the lawgiver, and presents man with the image of
his own holiness and the way to his creatures’ happiness; but after the fall, man was too impotent to
perform the law, and too polluted to enjoy a felicity. Redemption was then necessary; not that it was
necessary for God to redeem man, but it was necessary for man’s happiness that he should be recovered.
To this the Second Person is appointed, that by communion with him, man might derive a happiness, and
be brought again to God. But since man was blind in his understanding, and an enemy in his will to God,
there must be the exerting of a virtue to enlighten his mind, and bend his will to understand, and accept of
this redemption; and this work is assigned to the Third Person, the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) It was not congruous that the Father should assume human nature, and suffer in it for the
redemption of man. He was first in order; he was the lawgiver, and therefore to be the judge. As lawgiver,
it was not convenient he should stand in the stead of the law-breaker; and as judge, it was as little
convenient he should be reputed a malefactor. That he who had made a law against sin denounced a
penalty upon the commission of sin, and whose part it was actually to punish the sinner, should become
sin for the wilful transgressor of his law. He being the rector, how could he be an advocate and intercessor
to himself? How could he be the judge and the sacrifice? a judge, and yet a mediator to himself? If he had
been the sacrifice, there must be some person to examine the validity of it, and pronounce the sentence of
acceptance. Was it agreeable that the Son should sit upon a throne of judgment, and the Father stand at the
bar, and be responsible to the Son? That the Son should be in the place of a governor, and the Father in
the place of the criminal? That the Father should be bruised (Isa. 53:10) by the Son, as the Son was by the
Father (Zech. 13:70)? that the Son should awaken a sword against the Father, as the Father did against the
Son? That the Father should be sent by the Son, as the Son was by the Father (Gal. 4:4)? The order of the
persons in the blessed Trinity had been inverted and disturbed. Had the Father been sent, he had not been
first in order; the sender is before the person sent: as the Father begets, and the son is begotten (John
1:14), so the Father sends, and the son is sent. He whose orders is to send, cannot properly send himself.

     (2.) Nor was it congruous that the Spirit should be sent upon this affair. If the Holy Ghost had been
sent to redeem us, and the Son to apply that redemption to us, the order of the Persons had also been
inverted; the Spirit, then, who was third in order, had been second in operation. The Son would then have
received of the Spirit, as the Spirit doth now of Christ, “and shew it unto us” (John 1:15). As the Spirit
proceeded from the Father and the Son, so the proper function and operation of it was in order after the
operations of the Father and the Son. Had the Spirit been sent to redeem us, and the Son sent by the
Father, and the Spirit to apply that redemption to us, the Son in his acts had proceeded from the Father
and the Spirit; the Spirit, as sender, had been in order before the Son; whereas, the Spirit is called “the
Spirit of Christ,” as sent by Christ from the “Father” (Gal. 4:6; John 15:27). But as the order of the works,
so the order of the Persons is preserved in their several operations. Creation, and a law to govern the
creature, precedes redemption. Nothing, or that which hath no being, is not capable of a redeemed being.
Redemption supposeth the existence and the misery of a person redeemed. As creation precedes
redemption, so redemption precedes the application of it. As redemption supposeth the being of the
creature, so application of redemption supposeth the efficacy of redemption. According to the order of
these works, is the order of the operations of the Three Persons. Creation belongs to the Father, the first
person; redemption, the second work, is the function of the Son, the second person; application, the third
work, is the office of the Holy Ghost, the third person. The Father orders it, the Son acts it, the Holy
Ghost applies it. He purifies our souls to understand, believe, and love these mysteries. He forms Christ in
the womb of the soul, as he did the body of Christ in the womb of the Virgin. As the Spirit of God moved
upon the waters, to garnish and adorn the world, after the matter of it was formed (Gen. 1:2), so he moves
upon the heart, to supple it to a compliance with Christ, and draws the lineaments of the new creation in
the soul, after the foundation is laid. The Son pays the price that was due from us to God, and the Spirit is
the earnest of the promises of life and glory purchased by the merit of that death.791 It is to be observed,
that the, Father, under the dispensation of the law, proposed the commands, with the promises and
threatenings, to the understandings of men; and Christ, under the dispensation of grace, when he was upon
the earth, proposeth the gospel as the means of salvation, exhorts to faith as the condition of salvation; but
it was neither the functions of the one or the other to display such an efficacy in the understanding and
will to make men believe and obey; and, therefore, there were such few conversions in the time of Christ,
by his miracles. But this work was reserved for the fuller and brighter appearance of the Spirit, whose
office it was to convince the world of the necessity of a Redeemer, because of their lost condition; of the
person of the Redeemer, the Son of God; of the sufficiency and efficacy of redemption, because of his
righteousness and acceptation by the Father. The wisdom of God is seen in preparing and presenting the
objects, and then in making impression of them upon the subject he intends. And thus is the order of the
Three Persons preserved.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) The Second Person had the greatest congruity, in this work. He by whom God created the world
was most conveniently employed in restoring the defaced world (John 1:4): who more fit to recover it
from its lapsed state than he that had erected it in its primitive state (Heb. 1:2)? He was the light of men in
creation, and therefore it was most reasonable he should be the light of men in redemption. Who fitter to
reform the Divine image than he that first formed it? Who fitter to speak for us to God than he who was
the Word (John 1:1)? Who could better intercede with the Father than he who was the only begotten and
beloved Son? Who so fit to redeem the forfeited inheritance as the Heir of all things? Who fitter and
better to prevail for us to have the right of children than he that possessed it by nature? We fell from being
the sons of God, and who fitter to introduce us into an adopted state than the Son of God? Herein was an
expression of the richer grace, because the first sin was immediately against the wisdom of God, by an
ambitious affectation of a wisdom equal to God, that that person, who was the wisdom of God, should be
made a sacrifice for the expiation of the sin against wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    3. The wisdom of God is seen in the two natures of Christ, whereby this redemption was
accomplished. The union of the two natures was the foundation of the union of God and the fallen
creature.
</p>
<p>
    1st. The union itself is admirable: “The Word is made flesh” (John 1:14), one “equal with God in the
form of a servant” (Phil. 2:7). When the apostle speaks of “God manifested in the flesh,” he speaks “the
wisdom of God in a mystery” (1 Tim. 3:16); that which is incomprehensible to the angels, which they
never imagined before it was revealed, which perhaps they never knew till they beheld it. I am sure, under
the law, the figures of the cherubims were placed in the sanctuary, with their “faces looking towards the
propitiatory,” in a perpetual posture of contemplation and admiration (Exod. 37:9), to which the apostle
alludes (1 Pet. 1:12). Mysterious is the wisdom of God to unite finite and infinite, almightiness and
weakness, immortality and mortality, immutability, with a thing subject to change; to have a nature from
eternity, and yet a nature subject to the revolutions of time; a nature to make a law, and a nature to be
subjected to the law; to be God blessed forever, in the bosom of his Father, and an infant exposed to
calamities from the womb of his mother: terms seeming most distant from union, most uncapable of
conjunction, to shake hands together, to be most intimately conjoined; glory and vileness, fulness and
emptiness, heaven and earth; the creature with the Creator; he that made all things, in one person with a
nature that is made; Immanuel, God, and man in one; that which is most spiritual to partake of that which
is carnal flesh and blood (Heb. 2:14); one with the Father in his Godhead, one with us in his manhood; the
Godhead to be in him in the fullest perfection, and the manhood in the greatest purity; the creature one
with the Creator, and the Creator one with the creature. Thus is the incomprehensible wisdom of God
declared in the “Word being made flesh.”
</p>
<p>
    2d. In the manner of this union. A union of two natures, yet no natural union. It transcends all the
unions visible among creatures:792 it is not like the union of stones in a building, or two pieces of timber
fastened together, which touch one another only in their superficies and outside, without any intimacy
with one another. By such a kind of union God would not be a man: the Word could not so be made flesh.
Nor is it a union of parts to the whole, as the members and the body; the members are parts, the body is
the whole; for the whole results from the parts, and depends upon the parts: but Christ, being God, is
independent upon anything. The parts are in order of nature before the whole, but nothing can be in order
of nature before God. Nor is it as the union of two liquors, as when wine and water are mixed together, for
they are so incorporated as not to be distinguished from one another; no man can tell which particle is
wine, and which is water. But the properties of the Divine nature are distinguishable from the properties
of the human. Nor is it as the union of the soul and body, so as that the Deity is the form of the humanity,
as the soul is the form of the body: for as the soul is but a part of the man, so the Divinity would be then
but a part of the humanity; and as a form, or the soul, is in a state of imperfection, without that which it is
to inform, so the Divinity of Christ would have been imperfect till it had assumed the humanity, and so
the perfection of an eternal Deity would have depended on a creature of time. This union of two natures in
Christ is incomprehensible: and it is a mystery we cannot arrive to the top of, how the Divine nature,
which is the same with that of the Father and the Holy Ghost, should be united to the human nature,
without its being said that the Father and the Holy Ghost were united to the flesh; but the Scripture doth
not encourage any such notion; it speaks only of the Word, the person of the Word being made flesh, and
in his being made flesh, distinguisheth him from the Father, as “the only begotten of the Father” (John
1:14). The person of the Son was the term of this union.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) This union doth not confound the properties of the Deity and those of the humanity. They remain
distinct and entire in each other. The Deity is not changed into flesh, nor the flesh transformed into God:
they are distinct, and yet united; they are conjoined, and yet unmixed: the dues of either nature are
preserved. It is impossible that the majesty of the Divinity can receive an alteration. It is as impossible
that the meanness of the humanity can receive the impressions of the Deity, so as to be changed into it,
and a creature be metamorphosed into the Creator, and temporary flesh become eternal, and finite mount
up into infinity: as the soul and body are united, and make one person, yet the soul is not changed into the
effections of the body, nor the body into the perfections of the soul. There is a change made in the
humanity, by being advanced to a more excellent union, but not in the Deity, as a change is made in the
air, when it is enlightened by the sun, not in the sun, which communicates that brightness to the air.
Athanasius makes the burning bush to be a type of Christ’s incarnation (Exod. 3:2): the fire signifying the
Divine nature, and the bush the human. The bush is a branch springing up from the earth, and the fire
descends from heaven; as the bush was united to the fire, yet was not hurt by the flame, nor converted into
fire, there remained a difference between the bush and the fire, yet the properties of the fire shined in the
bush, so that the whole bush seemed to be on fire. So in the incarnation of Christ, the human nature is not
swallowed up by the Divine, nor changed into it, nor confounded with it, but so united, that the properties
of both remain firm: two are so become one, that they remain two still: one person in two natures,
containing the glorious perfections of the Divine, and the weaknesses of the human. The “fulness of the
Deity dwells bodily in Christ” (Col. 2:9).
</p>
<p>
     (2.) The Divine nature is united to every part of the humanity. The whole Divinity to the whole
humanity; so that no part but may be said to be the member of God, as well as the blood is said to be the
“blood of God” (Acts 20:28). By the same reason, it may be said, the hand of God, the eye of God, the
arm of God. As God is infinitely present everywhere, so as to be excluded from no place, so is the Deity
hypostatically everywhere in the humanity. not excluded from any part of it; as the light of the sun in
every part of the air; as a sparkling splendor in every part of the diamond. Therefore, it is concluded, by
all that acknowledge the Deity of Christ, that when his soul was separated from the body, the Deity
remained united both to soul and body, as light doth in every part of a broken crystal.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) Therefore, perpetually united (Col. 2:9). The “fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily.” It
dwells in him, not lodges in him, as a traveller in an inn: it resides in him as a fixed habitation. As God
describes the perpetuity of his presence in the ark by his habitation or dwelling in it (Exod. 29:44), so doth
the apostle the inseparable duration of the Deity in the humanity, and the indissoluble union of the
humanity with the Deity. It was united on earth; it remains united in heaven. It was not an image or an
apparition, as the tongues wherein the Spirit came upon the apostles, were a temporary representation, not
a thing united perpetually to the person of the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) It was a personal union. It was not an union of persons, though it was a personal union; so
Davenant expounds (Col. 2:9), Christ did not take the person of man, but the nature of man into
subsistence with himself. The body and soul of Christ were not united in themselves, had no subsistence
in themselves, till they were united to the person of the Son of God. If the person of a man were united to
him, the human nature would have been the nature of the person so united to him, and not the nature of
the Son of God (Heb.2:14, 16), “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, be also
himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of
Abraham.” He took flesh and blood to be his own nature, perpetually to subsist in the person of the Αόγος,
which must be by a personal union, or no way the Deity united to the humanity, and both natures to be
one person. This is the mysterious and manifold wisdom of God.
</p>
<p>
     3d. The end of this union.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) He was hereby fitted to be a Mediator. He hath something like to man, and something like to God.
If he were in all things only like to man, he would be at a distance from God: if he were in all things only
like to God, he would be at a distance from man. He is a true Mediator between mortal sinners and the
immortal righteous One. He was near to us by the infirmities of our nature, and near to God by the
perfections of the Divine; as near to God in his nature, as to us in ours; as near to us in our nature, as he is
to God in the Divine. Nothing that belongs to the Deity, but he possesses; nothing that belongs to the
human nature, but he is clothed with. He had both the nature which had offended, and that nature which
was offended: a nature to please God, and a nature to pleasure us: a nature, whereby he experimentally
knew the excellency of God, which was injured, and understood the glory due to him, and consequently
the greatness of the offence, which was to be measured by the dignity of his person: and a nature whereby
he might be sensible of the miseries contracted by, and endure the calamities due to the offender, that he
might both have compassion on him, and make due satisfaction for him. He had two distinct natures
capable of the affections and sentiments of the two persons he was to accord; he was a just judge of the
rights of the one, and the demerit of the other.793 He could not have this full and perfect understanding if
he did not possess the perfections of the one, and the qualities of the other; the one fitted him for “things
appertaining to God” (Heb. 5:1), and the other furnished him with a sense of the “infirmities of man”
(Heb. 4:15).
</p>
<p>
    (2.) He was hereby fitted for the working out the happiness of man. A Divine nature to communicate
to man, and a human nature to carry up to God. [1.] He had a nature whereby to suffer for us, and a nature
whereby to be meritorious in those sufferings. A nature to make him capable to bear the penalty, and a
nature to make his sufferings sufficient for all that embraced him. A nature, capable to be exposed to the
flames of Divine wrath, and another nature, incapable to be crushed by the weight, or consumed by the
heat of it: a human nature to suffer, and stand a sacrifice in the stead of man; a Divine nature to sanctify
these sufferings, and fill the nostrils of God with a sweet savor, and thereby atone his wrath: the one to
bear the stroke due to us, and the other to add merit to his sufferings for us. Had he not been man, he
could not have filled our place in suffering; and could he otherwise have suffered, his sufferings had not
been applicable to us; and had he not been God, his sufferings had not been meritoriously and fruitfully
applicable. Had not his blood been the blood of God, it had been of as little advantage as the blood of an
ordinary man, or the blood of the legal sacrifices (Heb. 9:12). Nothing less than God could have satisfied
God for the injury done by man. Nothing less than God could have countervailed the torments due to the
offending creature. Nothing less than God could have rescued us out of the hands of the jailor, too
powerful for us. [2.] He had, therefore, a nature to be compassionate to us, and victorious for us. A nature
sensibly to compassionate us, and another nature, to render those compassions effectual for our relief; he
had the compassions of our nature to pity us, and the patience of the Divine nature to bear with us. He
hath the affections of a man to us, and the power of a God for us: a nature to disarm the devil for us, and
another nature to be insensible of the working of the devil in us, and against us. If he had been only God,
he would not have had an experimental sense of our misery; and if he had been only man, he could not
have vanquished our enemies; had he been only God, he could not have died; and had he been only man,
he could not have conquered death. [3.] A nature efficaciously to instruct us. As man, he was to instruct
us sensibly; as God, he was to instruct us infallibly. A nature, whereby he might converse with us, and a
nature, whereby he might influence us in those converses. A human mouth to minister instruction to man,
and a Divine power to imprint it with efficacy. [4.] A nature to be a pattern to us. A pattern of grace as
man, as Adam was to have been to his posterity:794 a Divine nature shining in the human, the image of the
invisible God in the lass of our flesh, that he might be a perfect copy for our imitation (Col. 1:15), “The
image of the invisible God, and the first-born of every creature” in conjunction. The virtues of the Deity
are sweetened and tempered by the union with the humanity, as the beams of the son are by shining
through a colored glass, which condescends more to the weakness of our eye. Thus the perfections of the
invisible God, breaking through the first-born of every creature, glittering in Christ’s created state,
became more sensible for contemplation by our mind, and more imitiable for conformity in our practice.
[5.] A nature to be a ground of confidence in our approach to God. A nature wherein we may behold him,
and wherein we may approach to him. A nature for our comfort, and a nature for our confidence. Had he
been only man, he had been too feeble to assure us; and had he been only God, he had been too high to
attract us: but now we are allured by his human nature, and assured by his Divine, in our drawing near to
heaven. Communion with God was desired by us, but our guilt stifled our hopes, and the infinite
excellency of the Divine nature would have damped our hopes of speeding; but since these two natures, so
far distant, are met in a marriage-knot, we have a ground of hope, nay, an earnest, that the Creator and
believing creature shall meet and converse together. And since our sins are expatiated by the death of the
human nature in conjunction with the Divine, our guilt, upon believing, shall not hinder us from this
comfortable approach. Had he been only man, he could not have assured us an approach to God: had he
been only God, his justice would not have admitted us to approach to him; he had been too terrible for
guilty persons, and too holy for polluted persons to come near to him: but by being made man, his justice
is tempered, and by his being God and man, his mercy is ensured. A human nature he had, one with us,
that we might be related to God, as one with him. [6.] A nature to derive all good to us. Had he not been
man, we had had no share or part in him: a satisfaction by him had not been imputed to us. If he were not
God, he could not communicate to us divine graces and eternal happiness; he could not have had power to
convey so great a good to us, had he been only man; and he could not have done it, according to the rule
of inflexible righteousness, had he been only God. As man, he is the way of conveyance; as God, he is the
spring of conveyance. From this grace of union, and the grace of unction, we find rivers of waters flowing
to make glad the city of God. Believers are his branches, and draw sap from him, as he is their root in his
human nature, and have an endless duration of it from his Divine. Had he not been man, he had not been
in a state to obey the law; had he not been God as well as man, his obedience could not have been
valuable to be imputed to us. How should this mystery be studied by us, which would afford us both
admiration and content! Admiration, in the incomprehensibleness of it; contentment, in the fitness of the
Mediator. By this wisdom of God we receive the props of our faith, and the fruits of joy and peace.
Wisdom consists in choosing fit means, and conducting them in such a method, as may reach with good
success the variety of marks which are aimed at. Thus hath the wisdom of God set forth a Mediator, suited
to our wants, fitted for our supplies, and ordered so the whole affair by the union of these two natures in
the person of the Redeemer, that there could be no disappointment, by all the bustle hell and hellish
instruments could raise against it.
</p>
<p>
     4. The wisdom of God is seen in this way of redemption, in vindicating the honor and righteousness of
the law, both as to precept and penalty. The first and irreversible design of the law was obedience. The
penalty of the law had only entrance upon transgression. Obedience was the design, and the penalty was
added to enforce the observance of the precept (Gen. 2:17): “Thou shalt not eat;” there is the precept: “In
the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die;” there is the penalty. Obedience was our debt to the law, as
creatures; punishment was due from the law to us, as sinners: we are bound to endure the penalty for our
first transgression, but the penalty did not cancel the bond of future obedience; the penalty had not been
incurred without transgressing the precept; yet the precept was not abrogated by enduring the penalty.
Since man so soon revolted, and by this revolt fell under the threatening, the justice of the law had been
honored by man’s sufferings, but the holiness and equity of the law had been honored by man’s
obedience. The wisdom of God finds out a medium to satisfy both: the justice of the law is preserved in
the execution of the penalty; and the holiness of the law is honored in the observance of the precept. The
life of our Saviour is a conformity to the precept, and his death is a conformity to the penalty; the precepts
are exactly performed, and the curse punctually executed, by a voluntary observing the one, and a
voluntary undergoing the other. It is obeyed, as if it had not been transgressed, and executed as if it had
not been obeyed. It became the wisdom, justice, and holiness of God, as the Rector of the world, to exact
it (Heb. 2:10), and it became the holiness of the Mediator to “fulfil all the righteousness of the law” (Rom.
8:3; Matt. 3:15). And thus the honor of the law was vindicated in all the parts of it. The transgression of
the law was condemned in the flesh of the Redeemer, and the righteousness of the law was fulfilled in his
person: and both these acts of obedience, being counted as one righteousness, and imputed to the
believing sinner, render him a subject to the law, both in its perceptive and minatory part. By Adam’s
sinful acting we were made sinners, and by Christ’s righteous acting we are made righteous (Rom. 5:19):
“As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
righteous.” The law was obeyed by him, that the righteousness of it might be fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4). It
is not fulfilled in us, or in our actions, by inherency, but fulfilled in us by imputation of that righteousness
which was exactly fulfilled by another. As he died for us, and rose again for us, so he lived for us. The
commands of the law were as well observed for us, as the threatenings of the law were endured for us.
This justification of a sinner, with the preservation of the holiness of the law in truth, in the inward parts,
in sincerity of intention, as well as conformity in action, is the wisdom of God, the gospel wisdom which
David desires to know (Psalm 51:6): “Thou desirest truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part thou
shalt make me to know wisdom;” or, as some render it, “the hidden things of wisdom.” Not an inherent
wisdom in the acknowledgments of his sin, which he had confessed before, but the wisdom of God in
providing a medicine, so as to keep up the holiness of the law in the observance of it in truth, and the
averting the judgment due to the sinner. In and by this way methodized by the wisdom of God, all doubts
and troubles are discharged. Naturally, if we take a view of the law to behold its holiness and justice, and
then of our hearts, to sec the contrariety in them to the command, and the pollution repugnant to its
holiness; and after this, cast our eyes upward, and beholding a flaming sword, edged with curses and
wrath; is there any matter, but that of terror, afforded by any of these? But when we behold, in the life of
Christ, a conformity to the mandatory part of the law, and in the cross of Christ, a sustaining the minatory
part of the law, this wisdom of God gives a well-grounded and rational dismiss to all the horrors that can
seize upon us.
</p>
<p>
     5. The wisdom of God in redemption is visible in manifesting two contrary affections at the same
time, and in one act: the greatest hatred of sin, and the greatest love to the sinner. In this way he punishes
the sin without ruining the sinner, and repairs the ruins of the sinner without indulging the sin. Here is
eternal love and eternal hatred; a condemning the sin to what it merited, and an advancing the sinner to
what he could not expect. Herein is the choicest love and the deepest hatred manifested: an
implacableness against the sin, and a placableness to the sinner. His hatred of sin hath been discovered in
other ways: in punishing the devil without remedy; sentencing man to an expulsion from paradise, though
seduced by another; in accursing the serpent, an irrational creature, though but a misguided instrument.
The whole tenor of his threatenings declare his loathing of sin, and the sprinklings of his judgments in the
world, and the horrible expectations of terrified consciences confirm it. But what are all these testimonies
to the highest evidence that can possibly be given in the sheathing the sword of his wrath in the heart of
his Son? If a father should order his son to take a mean garb below his dignity, order him to be dragged to
prison, seem to throw off all affection of a father for the severity of a judge, condemn his son to a horrible
death, be a spectator of his bleeding condition, withhold his hand from assuaging his misery, regard it
rather with joy than sorrow, give him a bitter cup to drink, and stand by to see him drink it off to the
bottom, dregs and all, and flash frowns in his face all the while; and this not for any fault of his own, but
the rebellion of some subjects he undertook for, and that the offenders might have a pardon sealed by the
blood of the son, the sufferer: all this would evidence his detestation of the rebellion, and his affection to
the rebels i his hatred to their crime, and his love to their welfare. This did God do. He “delivered Christ
up for our offences” (Rom. 8:32); the Father gave him the cup (John 18:18); the Lord bruised him with
pleasure (Isa. 53:10), and that for sin. He transferred upon the shoulders of his Son the pain we had
merited, that the criminal might be restored to the place he had forfeited. He hates the sin so as to
condemn it forever, and wrap it up in the curse he had threatened; and loves the sinner, believing and
repenting, so as to mount him to an expectation of a happiness exceeding the first estate, both in glory and
perpetuity. Instead of an earthly paradise, lays the foundation of an heavenly mansion, brings forth a
weight of glory from a weight of misery, separates the comfortable light of the sun from the scorching
heat we had deserved at his hands. Thus hath God’s hatred of sin been manifested. He is at eternal
defiance with sin, yet nearer in alliance with the sinner than he was before the revolt; as if man’s
miserable fall had endeared him to the Judge. This is the wisdom and prudence of “grace wherein God
hath abounded” (Eph. 1:9) a wisdom in twisting the happy restoration of the broken amity, with an
everlasting curse upon that which made the breach, both upon sin the cause, and upon Satan the seducer to
it. Thus is hatred and love, in their highest glory, manifested together: hatred to sin, in the death of Christ,
more than if the torments of hell had been undergone by the sinner; and love to the sinner, more than if he
had, by an absolute and simple bounty, bestowed upon him the possession of heaven; because the gift of
his Son, for such an end, is a greater token of his boundless affections, than a reinstating man in paradise.
Thus is the wisdom of God seen in redemption, consuming the sin, and recovering the sinner.
</p>
<p>
    6. The wisdom of God is evident in overturning the devil’s empire by the nature he had vanquished,
and by ways quite contrary to what that malicious spirit could imagine. The devil, indeed, read his own
doom in the first promise, and found his ruin resolved upon, by the means of the “Seed of the woman;”
but by what seed was not so easily known to him.795 And the methods whereby it was to be brought about
was a mystery kept secret from the malicious devils, since it was not discovered to the obedient angels.
He might know, from Isa. 53, that the Redeemer was assured to divide the spoil with the strong, and
rescue a part of the lost creation out of his hands; and that this was to be effected by making his soul an
offering for sin: but could he imagine which way his soul was to be made such an offering? He shrewdly
suspected Christ, just after his inauguration into his office by baptism, to be the Son of God but did he
ever dream that the Messiah, by dying as a reputed malefactor, should be a sacrifice for the expiation of
the sin the devil had introduced by his subtilty? Did he ever imagine a cross should dispossess him of his
crown, and that dying groans should wrest the victory out of his hands? He was conquered by that nature
he had cast headlong into ruin: a woman, by his subtilty, was the occasion of our death; and a woman, by
the conduct of the only wise God, brings forth the Author of our life, and the Conqueror of our enemies.
The flesh of the old Adam had infected us, and the flesh of the new Adam cures us (1 Cor. 15:21): “By
man came death; by man also came the resurrection from the dead.” We are killed by the old Adam, and
raised by the new; as among the Israelites, a fiery serpent gave the wound, and a brazen serpent
administers the cure. The nature that was deceived bruiseth the deceiver, and raiseth up the foundations of
his kingdom. Satan is defeated by the counsels he took to secure his possession, and loses the victory by
the same means whereby he thought to preserve it. His tempting the Jews to the sin of crucifying the Son
of God, had a contrary success to his tempting Adam to eat of the tree. The first death he brought upon
Adam, ruined us, and the death he brought by his instruments upon the second Adam, restored us. By a
tree, if one may so say, he had triumphed over the world, and by the fruit of a tree, one hanging upon a
tree, he is discharged of his power over us (Heb. 2:14): “Through death he destroyed Him that had the
power of death.” And thus the devil ruins his own kingdom while he thinks to confirm and enlarge it; and
is defeated by his own policy, whereby he thought to continue the world under his chains, and deprive the
Creator of the world of his purposed honor. What deeper counsel could he resolve upon for his own
security, than to be instrumental in the death of him, who was God, the terror of the devil himself, and to
bring the Redeemer of the world to expire with disgrace in the sight of a multitude of men? Thus did the
wisdom of God shine forth in restoring us by methods seemingly repugnant to the end he aimed at, and
above the suspicion of a subtle devil, whom he intended to baffle. Could he imagine that we should be
healed by stripes, quickened by death, purified by blood, crowned by a cross, advanced to the highest
honor by the lowest humility, comforted by sorrows, glorified by disgrace, absolved by condemnation,
and made rich by poverty? That the sweetest honey should at once spring out of the belly of a dead lion,
the lion of the tribe of Judah, and out of the bosom of the living God? How wonderful is this wisdom of
God! that the Seed of the woman, born of a mean virgin, brought forth in a stable, spending his days in
affliction, misery, and poverty, without any pomp and splendor, passing some time in a carpenters shop,
with carpenter’s tools (Mark 6:6), and afterwards exposed to a horrible and disgraceful death, should, by
this way, pull down the gates of hell, subvert the kingdom of the devil, and be the hammer to break in
pieces that power, which he had so long exercised over the world! Thus became he the author of our life,
by being bound for a while in the chains of death, and arrived to a principality over the most malicious
powers, by being a prisoner for us, and the anvil of their rage and fury.
</p>
<p>
    7. The wisdom of God appears, in giving us this way the sureest ground of comfort, and the strongest
incentive to obedience. The rebel is reconciled, and the rebellion shamed; God is propitiated, and the
sinner sanctified, by the same blood. What can more contribute to our comfort and confidence, than God’s
richest gift to us? What can more enflame our love to him, than our recovery from death by the oblation
of his Son to misery and death for us? It doth as much engage our duty as secure our happiness. It
presents God glorious and gracious, and therefore every way fit to be trusted in regard of the interest of
his own glory in it, and in regard of the effusions of his grace by it. It renders the creature obliged in the
highest manner, and so awakens his industry to the strictest and noblest obedience. Nothing so effectual
as a crucified Christ to wean us from sin, and stifle all motions of despair; a means, in regard of the justice
signalized in it, to make man to hate the sin which had ruined him; and a means, in regard of the love
expressed to make him delight in that law he had violated (2 Cor. 5:14, 15). The love of Christ, and
therefore the love of God expressed in it, constrains us no longer to live to ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) It is a ground of the highest comfort and confidence in God. Since he hath given such an evidence
of his impartial truth to his threatening for the honor of his justice, we need not question but he will be as
punctual to his promise for the honor of his mercy. It is a ground of confidence in God, since he hath
redeemed us in such a way as glorifies the steadiness of his veracity, as well as the severity of his justice;
we may well trust him for the performance of his promise, since we have experience of the execution of
his threatening; his merciful truth will as much engage him to accomplish the one, as his just truth did to
inflict the other. The goodness which shone forth in weaker rays in the creation, breaks out with stronger
beams in redemption. And the mercy which before the appearance of Christ was manifested in some small
rivulets, diffuseth itself like a brnindless ocean. That God, that was our Creator, is our Redeemer, the
repairer of our breaches, and the restorer of our paths to dwell in. And the plenteous redemption from all
iniquity, manifest ed in the incarnation and passion of the Son of God, is much more a ground of hope in
the Lord than it was in past ages, when it could not be said, “The Lord hath, but the Lord shall, redeem
Israel from all his iniquities” (Psalm 130:8). It is a full warrant to cast ourselves into his arms.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) An incentive to obedience.
</p>
<p>
    [l.] The commands of the gospel require the obedience of the creature. There is not one precept in the
gospel which interferes with any rule in the law, but strengthens it, and represents it in its true exactness:
the heat to scorch us is allayed, but the light to direct us is not extinguished. Not the least allowance to
any sin is granted; not the least affection to any sin is indulged. The law is tempered by the gospel, but not
nulled and cast out of doors by it: it enacts that none but those that are sanctified, shall be glorified; that
there must be grace here, if we expect glory hereafter; that we must not presume to expect an admittance
to the vision of God’s face unless our souls be clothed with a robe of holiness (Heb. 12:14). It requires an
obedience to the whole law in our intention and purpose, and an endeavor to observe it in our actions; it
promotes the honor of God, and ordains a universal charity among men; it reveals the whole counsel of
God, and furnisheth men with the holiest laws.
</p>
<p>
    [2.] It presents to us the exactest pattern for our obedience. The redeeming person is not only a
propitiation for the sin, but a pattern to the sinner (1 Pet. 2:21). The conscience of man, after the fall of
Adam, approved of the reason of the law, but by the corruption of nature man had no strength to perform
the law. The possibility of keeping the law, by human nature, is evidenced by the appearance and life of
the Redeemer, and an assurance given that it shall be advanced to such a state as to be able to observe it:
we aspire to it in this life, and have hopes to attain it in a future; and, while we are here, the actor of our
redemption is the copy for our imitation. The pattern to imitate is greater than the law to be ruled by.
What a lustre did his virtues cast about the world! How attractive are his graces! With what high examples
for all duties has he furnished us out of the copy of his life!
</p>
<p>
    [3.] It presents us with the strongest motives to obedience (Tit. 2:11, 12): “The grace of God teaches
us to deny ungodlinsss.” What chains bind us faster and closer than love? Here is love to our nature in his
incarnation; love to us, though enemies, in his death and passion; encouragements to obedience by the
proffers of pardon for former rebellions. By the disobedience of man, God introduceth his redeeming
grace, and engageth his creature to more ingenuous and excellent returns than his innocent state could
oblige him to. In his created state he had goodness to move him, he hath the same goodness now to oblige
him as a creature, and a greater love and mercy to oblige him as a repaired creature; and the terror of
justice is taken off, which might envenom his heart as a criminal. In his revolted state he had misery to
discourage him; in his redeemed state he hath love to attract him. Without such a way, black despair had
seized upon the creature exposed to a remediless misery, and God would have had no returns of love from
the best of his earthly works; but if any sparks of ingenuity be left, they will be excited by the efficacy of
this argument. The willingness of God to receive returning sinners, is manifested in the highest degree;
and the willingness of a sinner to return to him in duty hath the strongest engagements. He hath done as
much to encourage our obedience, as to illustrate his glory. We cannot conceive what could be done
greater for the salvation of our souls, and consequently what could have been done, more to enforce our
observance. We have a Redeemer, as man, to copy it to us, and as God, to perfect us in it. It would make
the heart of any to tremble to wound him that hath provided such a salve for our sores, and to make grace
a warrant for rebellion—motives capable to form rocks into a flexibleness. Thus is the wisdom of God
seen in giving us a ground to the surest confidence, and furnishing us with incentives to the greatest
obedience, by the horrors of wrath, death and sufferings of our Saviour.
</p>
<p>
    8. The wisdom of God is apparent in the condition he hath settled for the enjoying the fruits of
redemption: and this is faith, a wise and reasonable condition and the concomitants of it—
</p>
<p>
    (1.) In that it is suited to man’s lapsed state and God’s glory. Innocence is not required here; that had
been a condition impossible in its own nature after the fall. The rejecting of mercy is now only
condemning, where mercy is proposed. Had the condition of perfection in works been required, it had
rather been a condemnation than redemption. Works are not demanded, whereby the creature might
ascribe anything to himself, but a condition, which continues in man a sense of his apostasy, abates all
aspiring pride, and makes the reward of grace, not of debt; a condition, whereby mercy is owned, and the
creature emptied; flesh silenced in the dust, and God set upon his throne of grace and authority; the
creature brought to the lowest debasement, and Divine glory raised to the highest pitch. the creature is
brought to acknowledge mercy, and seal to justice; to own the holiness of God, in the hatred of sin; the
justice of God, in the punishment of sin; and the mercy of God, in the pardoning of sin: a condition that
despoils nature of all its pretended excellency; beats down the glory of man at the foot of God (1 Cor.
1:29, 31). It subjects the reason and will of man to the wisdom and authority of God; it brings the creature
to an unreserved submission and entire resignation. God is made the sovereign cause of all; the creature
continued in his emptiness, and reduced to a greater dependence upon God than by a creation; depending
upon him for a constant influx, for an entire happiness: a condition that renders God glorious in the
creature, and the fallen creature happy in God; God glorious in his condescension to man, and man happy
in his emptiness before God. Faith is made the condition of man’s recovery, that “the lofty looks of man
might be humbled, and the haughtiness of man be pulled down” (Isa. 2:11); that every towering
imagination might be levelled (2 Cor. 10:5). Man must have all from without doors; he must not live upon
himself, but upon another’s allowance. He must stand to the provision of God, and be a perpetual suitor at
his gates.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) A condition opposite to that which was the cause of the fall. We fell from God by an unbelief of
the threatening; he recovers us by a belief of the promise; by unbelief we laid the foundation of God’s
dishonor; by faith, therefore, God exalts the glory of his free grace. We lost ourselves by a desire of self-
dependence, and our return is ordered by way of self-emptiness. It is reasonable we should be restored in
a way contrary to that whereby we fell; we sinned by a refusal of cleaving to God; it is a part of divine
wisdom to restore us in a denial of our own righteousness and strength.796 Man having sinned by pride,
the wisdom of God humbles him (saith one) at the very root of the tree of knowledge, and makes him
deny his own understanding, and submit to faith, or else, forever to lose his desired felicity.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) It is a condition suited to the common sentiment and custom of the world. There is more of belief
than reason in the world. All instructors and masters in sciences and arts, require, first a belief in their
disciples, and a resignation of their understandings and wills to them. And it is the wisdom of God to
require that of man, which his own reason makes him submit to another which is his fellow-creature. He,
therefore, that quarrels with the condition of faith, must quarrel with all the world, since belief is the
beginning of all knowledge;797 yea, and most of the knowledge in the world, may rather come under the
title of belief, than of knowledge; for what we think we know this day, we may find from others such
arguments as may stagger our knowledge, and make us doubt of that we thought ourselves certain of
before: nay, sometimes we change our opinions ourselves without any instructor, and see a reason to
entertain an opinion quite contrary to what we had before. And if we found a general judgment of others
to vote against what we think we know, it would make us give the less credit to ourselves and our own
sentiments. All knowledge in the world is only a belief, depending upon the testimony or arguings of
others; for, indeed, it may be said of all men, as in Job (8:9), “We are but of yesterday, and know
nothing.” Since, therefore, belief is so universal a thing in the world, the wisdom of God requires that of
us which every man must count reasonable, or render himself utterly ignorant of anything. It is a
condition that is common to all religions. All religions are founded upon a belief: unless men did believe
future things, they would not hope nor fear. A belief and resignation was required in all the idolatries in
the world; so that God requires nothing but what a universal custom of the world gives its suffrage to the
reasonableness of: indeed, justifying faith is not suited to the sentiments of men; but that faith which must
precede justifying, a belief of the doctrine, though not comprehended by reason, is common to the custom
of the world.798 It is no less madness not to submit our reason to faith, than not to regulate our fancies by
reason.
</p>
<p>
     (4.) This condition of faith and repentance is suited to the conscience of men. The law of nature
teaches us, that we are bound to believe every revelation from God, when it is made known to us and not
only to assent to it as true, but embrace it as good. This nature dictates, that we are as much obliged to
believe God, because of his truth, as to love him, because of his goodness. Every man’s reason tells him,
he cannot obey a precept, nor depend upon a promise, unless he believes both the one and the other. No
man’s conscience but will inform him, upon hearing the revelation of God concerning his excellent
contrivance of redemption, and the way to enjoy it, that it is very reasonable he should strip off all
affections to sin, lie down in sorrow, and bewail what he hath done amiss against so tender a God. Can
you expect that any man that promises you a great honor or a rich donative, should demand less of you
than to trust his word, bear an affection to him, and return him kindness? Can any less be expected by a
prince than obedience from a pardoned subject, and a redeemed captive? If you have injured any man in
his body, estate, reputation, would you not count it a reasonable condition for the partaking of his
clemency and forgiveness, to express a hearty sorrow for it, and a resolution not to fall into the like crime
again? Such are the conditions of the gospel, suited to the consciences of men.
</p>
<p>
     (5.) The wisdom of God appears, in that this condition was only likelv to attain the end. There are but
two common heads appointed by God,—Adam and Christ: by one we are made a living soul, by the other
a quickening spirit: by the one we are made sinners, by the other we are made righteous. Adam fell as a
head, and all his members, his whole issue and posterity, fell with him, because they proceeded from him
by natural generation. But since the second Adam cannot be our head by natural generation, there must be
some other way of engrafting us in him, and uniting us to him as our Head, which must be moral and
spiritual; this cannot rationally be conceived to be by any other way than what is suitable to a reasonable
creature, and, therefore, must be by an act of the will, consent and acceptance, and owning the terms
settled for an admission to that union. And this is that we properly call faith, and, therefore, called a
receiving of him (John 1:12).
</p>
<p>
     [1.] Now this condition of enjoying the fruits of redemption could not be a bare knowledge; for that is
but only an act of the understanding, and doth not in itself include the act of the will, and so would have
united only one faculty to him, not the whole soul: but faith is an act both of the understanding and will
too; and principally of the will, which doth presuppose an act of the understanding for there cannot be a
persuasion in the will, without a proposition from the understanding. The understanding must be
convinced of the truth and goodness of a thing, before the will can be persuaded to make any motion
towards it; and, therefore, all the promises, invitations, and proffers, are suited to the understanding and
will; to the understanding in regard of knowledge, to the will in regard of appetite; to the understanding as
true, to the will as good; to the understanding as practical, and influencing the will.
</p>
<p>
     [2.] Nor could it be an entire obedience. That, as was said before, would have made the creature have
some matter of boasting, and this was not suitable to the condition he was sunk into by the fall. Besides,
man’s nature being corrupted, was rendered incapable to obey, and unable to have one thought of a due
obedience (2 Cor. 3:5). When man turned from God, and upon that was turned out of paradise, his return
was impossible by any strength of his own; his nature was as much corrupted as his re-entrance into
paradise was prohibited. That covenant, whereby he stood in the garden, required a perfection of action
and intention in the observance of all the commands of God: but his fall had cracked his ability to recover
happiness by the terms and condition of an entire obedience; yet man being a person governable by a law,
and capable of happiness by a covenant, if God would restore him, and enter into a covenant with him, we
must suppose it to have some condition, as all covenants have. That condition could not be works,
because man’s nature was polluted. Indeed, bad God reduced man’s body to the dust, and his soul to
nothing, and framed another man, he might have governed him by a covenant of works: but that had not
been the same man that had revolted, and upon his revolt was stained and disabled. But suppose God had,
by any transcendent grace, wholly purified him from the stain of his former transgression, and restored to
him the strength and ability he had lost, might he not as easily have rebelled again? And so the condition
would never have been accomplished, the covenant never have been performed, and happiness never have
been enjoyed. There must be some other condition then in the covenant God would make for man’s
security. Now faith is the most proper for receiving the promise of pardon of sin belief of those promises
is the first natural reflection that a malefactor can make upon a pardon offered him, and acceptance of it is
the first consequent from that belief. Hence is faith entitled a persuasion of, and embracing the promises
(Heb. 11:13, and a receiving the atonement (Rom. 5:11). Thus the wisdom of’ God is apparent in
annexing such a condition to the covenant, whereby man is restored, as answers the end of God for his
glory, the state, conscience, and necessity of man, and had the greatest congruity to his recovery.
</p>
<p>
     9. This wisdom of God is manifest in the manner of the publishing and propagating this doctrine of
redemption.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) In the gradual discoveries of it. Flashing a great light in the face of a sudden is amazing; should
the sun glare in our eye in all its brightness on a sudden, after we have been in a thick darkness, it would
blind us, instead of comforting us: so great a work as this must have several digestions. God first reveals
of what seed the Redeeming Person should be, “the Seed of the woman” (Gen. 3:15); then of what nation
(Gen. 26:4); then of what tribe (Gen. 49:12),—of the tribe of Judah; then of what family,—the family of
David; then what works he was to do, what sufferings to undergo. The first predictions of our Saviour
were obscure. Adam could not well see the redemption in the promise for the punishment of death which
succeeded in the threatening; the promise exercised his faith, and the obscurity and bodily death, his
humility. The promise made to Abraham was clearer than the revelations made before, yet he could not
tell how to reconcile his redemption with his exile. God supported his faith by the promise, and exercised
his humility by making him a pilgrim, and keeping him in a perpetual dependence upon him in all his
motions. The declarations to Moses are brighter than those to Abraham: the delineations of Christ by
David, in the Psalms, more illustrious than the former: and all those exceeded by the revelations made to
the prophet Isaiah, and the other prophets, according as the age did approach wherein the Redeemer was
to enter into his office. God wrapped up this gospel in a multitude of types and ceremonies fitted to the
infant state of the church (Gal. 4:8). An infant state is usually affected with sensible things; yet all those
ceremonies were fitted to that great end of the gospel, which he would bring forth in time to the world.
And the wisdom of God in them would be amazing, if we could understand the analogy between every
ceremony in the law and the thing signified by it: as it cannot but affect a diligent reader to observe that
little account of them we have by the apostle Paul, sprinkled in his epistles, and more largely in that to the
Hebrews. As the political laws of the Jews flowed from the depth of the moral law, so their ceremonial
did from the depth of evangelical counsels, and all of them had a special relation to the honor of God, and
the debasing the creature. Though God formed the mass and matter of the world at the first creation at
once, yet his wisdom took six days time for the disposing and adorning it. The more illustrious truths of
God are not to be comprehended on a sudden by the weakness of men. Christ did not declare all truths to
his disciples in the time of his life, because the were not able at that resent to bear them (John 16:12): “Ye
cannot bear them now;” some were reserved for his resurrection, others for the coming of the Spirit, and
the full discovery of all kept back for another world. This doctrine God figured out in the law, oracled by
the prophets, and unveiled by Christ and his apostles.
</p>
<p>
     (2.) The wisdom of God appeared in using all proper means to render the belief of it easy.
</p>
<p>
     [1.] The most minute things that were to be transacted were predicted in the ancient foregoing age,
long before the coming of the Redeemer. The vinegar and gall offered to him upon the cross, the parting
his garments, the not breaking of his bones, the piercing of his hands and feet, the betraying of him, the
slighting of hire by the multitude, all were exactly painted and represented in variety of figures. There was
light enough to good men not to mistake him, and yet not so plain as to hinder bad men from being
serviceable to the counsels of God in the crucifying of him when he came.
</p>
<p>
     [2.] The translation of the Old Testament from the private language of the Jews, into the most public
language of the world; that translation which we call Septuagint, from Hebrew into Greek, some years
before the coming of Christ, that tongue being most diffused at that time, by reason of the Macedonian
empire, raised by Alexander, and the university of Athens, to which other nations resorted for learning
and education. This was a preparation for the sons of Japhet to “dwell in the tents of Shem.” By this was
the entertainment of the gospel facilitated; when they compared the prophesies of the Old Testament with
the declarations of the New, and found things so long predicted before they were transacted in the public
view.
</p>
<p>
     [3.] By ordering concurrent testimonies, as to matter of fact, that the matter of fact was not deniable.
That there was such a person as Christ, that his miracles were stupendous, that his doctrine did not incline
to sedition, that he affected not worldly applause, that he did suffer at Jerusalem, was acknowledged by
all; not a man among the greatest enemies of Christians was found that denied the matter of fact. And this
great truth, that Christ is the Messiah and Redeemer, hath been with universal consent owned by all the
professors of Christianity throughout the world: whatever bickerlngs there have been among them about
some particular doctrines, they all centred in that truth of Christ’s being the Redeemer. The first
publication of this doctrine was sealed by a thousand miracles, and so illustrious, that he was an utter
stranger to the world that was ignorant of them.
</p>
<p>
     [4.] In keeping up some principles and opinions in the world to facilitate the belief of this, or render
men inexcusable for rejecting of it. The incarnation of the son of God could not be so strange to the world,
if we consider the general belief of the appearances799 of their gods among them; that the Epicureans and
others, that denied any such appearances, were counted atheists.800 And Pythagoras was esteemed to be
one, not of the inferior genii and lunar demons, but one of the higher gods, who appeared in a human
body, for the curing and rectifying mortal life;801 and himself tells Abaris, the Scythian, that he was
άνθρωπόμορφος, that he “took the flesh of man,” that men might not be astonished at him, and in a fright
fly from his instructions. It was not therefore accounted an irrational thing among them, that God should
be incarnate: but, indeed, the great stumbling-block was a crucified God. But had they known the holy
and righteous nature of God, the malice of sin, the universal corruption of human nature, the first
threatening, and the necessity of vindicating the honor of the law, and clearing the justice of God, the
notion of his crucifixion would not have appeared so incredible, since they believed the possibility of an
incarnation.
</p>
<p>
     Another principle was that universal one of sacrifices for expiation, and rendering God propitious to
man, and was practised among all nations. I remember not any wherein this custom did not prevail; for it
did even among those people where the Jews, as being no trading nation, had not any commerce; and also
in America, found out in these latter ages. It was not a law of nature; no man can find any such thing
written in his own heart, but a tradition from Adam. Now that among the loss of so many other doctrines
that were handed down from Adam to his immediate posterity, as, in particular, that of the “Seed of the
woman,” which one would think a necessary appendix to that of sacrificing, this latter should be
preserved as a fragment of an ancient tradition, seems to be an act of Divine wisdom, to prepare men for
the entertainment of the doctrine of the great Sacrifice for the expiation of the sin of the world. And as the
apostle forms his argument from the Jewish sacrifices, in the epistle to the Hebrews, for the convincing
them of the end of the death of Christ, so did the ancient fathers make use of this practice of the heathen
to convince them of the same doctrine.
</p>
<p>
     [5.] The wisdom of God appeared in the time and circumstances of the first solemn publication of the
gospel by the apostles at Jerusalem. The relation you may read in Acts 2:1–12. The Spirit was given to the
apostles on the day of Pentecost; a time wherein there were multitudes of Jews from all nations, not only
near, but remote, that heard the great things of God spoken in the several languages of those nations
where their habitations were fixed, and that by twelve illiterate men, that two or three hours before knew
no language but that of their native country. It was the custom of the Jews, that dwelt among other
nations, at a distance from Jerusalem, to assemble together at Jerusalem at the feast of Pentecost: and God
pitched upon this season, that there might be witnesses of this miracle in many parts of the world: there
were some of every nation under heaven (ver 5); that is, of that known part of the world, so saith the text.
Fourteen several nations are mentioned; and proselytes as well as Jews by birth. They are called“devout
men,” men of conscience, whose testimony would carry weight with it among their neighbors at their
return, because of their reputation by their religious carriage. Again, this was not heard and seen by some
of them at one time, and some at another, by some one hour, by others the next suecessively,802 but
altogether, in a solemn assembly, that the testimony of so many witnesses at a time, might be more valid,
and the truth of the doctrine appear more illustrious and undeniable. And it must needs be astonishing to
them, to hear that person magnified in so miraculous a manner, who had so lately been condemned by
their countrymen as a malefactor. Wisdom consists in the timing of things. And in this circumstance doth
the wisdom of God appear, in furnishing the apostles with the Spirit at such a time, and bringing forth
such a miracle, as the gift of tongues, on a sudden, that every nation might hear in their own language the
wonder of redemption, and as witnesses at their returns into their own countries, report it to others; that
the credit they had, in their several places, might facilitate the belief and entertainment of the gospel,
when the apostles, or others, should arrive to those several charges and dioceses appointed for them to
preach the gospel in. Had this miracle been wrought in the presence only of the inhabitants of Judea, that
understood only their own language, or one or two of the neighboring tongues, it had been counted by
them rather a madness than a miracle. Or had they understood all the tongues which they spoke, the news
of it had spread no further than the limits of their own habitations, and had been confined within the
narrow bounds of the land of Judea. But now it is carried to several remote nations, where any of those
auditors then assembled had their residence. As God chose the time of the Passover for the death of
Christ, that there might be the greatest number of the inhabitants of the country, as witnesses of the matter
of fact, the innocence and sufferings of Christ, so he chose the time of Pentecost for the first publishing
the value and end of this blood to the world. Thus the evangelical law was given in a confluence of people
from all parts and nations, because it was a covenant with all nations: and the variety of languages spoken
by a company of poor Galileans, bred up at the lake of Tiberias, and in poor corners of Canaan, without
the instructions of men for so great a skill, might well evidence to the hearers, that God that brought the
confusion of languages first at Babel, did only work that cure of them, and combine all together at
Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) The wisdom of God is seen in the instruments he employed in the publishing the gospel. He did
not employ philosophers, but fishermen; used not acquired arts, but infused wisdom and courage. This
treasure was put into, and preserved in earthen vessels, that the wisdom, as well as the power of God,
might be magnified. The weaker the means are which attain the end, the greater is the skill of the
conductor of them. Wise princes choose men of most credit, interest, wisdom, and ability, to be ministers
of their affairs, and ambassadors to others. But what were these that God chose for so great a work, as the
publishing a new doctrine to the world? What was their quality but mean, what was their authority
without interest? What was their ability, without eminent parts for so great a work, but what Divine grace
in a special manner endowed them with? Nay, what was their disposition to it? as dull and unwieldy.
Witness the frequent rebukes for their slow-heartedness, from their Master, when he conversed in the
flesh with them. And one of the greatest of them, so fond of the Jewish ceremonies and Pharisaical
principles, wherein he had been more than ordinarily principled, that he hated the Christian religion to
extirpation, and the professors of it to death; by those ways which were out of the road of human wisdom,
and would be accounted the greatest absurdity to be practised by men that have a repute for discretion, did
God advance his wisdom (1 Cor. 1:25): “The foolishness of God is wiser than man.” By this means it was
indisputably evidenced to unbiassed minds, that the doctrine was divine. It could not rationally be
imagined, that instruments destitute of all human advantages, should be able to vanquish the world,
confound Judaism, overturn heathenism, chase away the devils, strip them of their temples, alienate the
minds of men from their several religions, which had been rooted in them by education, and established
by a long succession. It could not, I say, reasonably be imagined to be without a supernatural assistance,
an heavenly and efficacious working: whereas, had God taken a course agreeable to the prudence of man,
and used those that had been furnished with learning, tipped with eloquence, and armed with human
authority, the doctrines would have been thought to have been of a human invention, and to be some
subtle contrivance for some unworthy and ambitious end: the nothingness and weakness of the
instruments manifest them to be conducted by a Divine power, and declare the doctrine itself to be from
heaven. When we see such feeble instruments proclaiming a doctrine repugnant to flesh and blood,
sounding forth a crucified Christ to be believed in, and trusted on, and declaiming against the religion and
worship under which the Roman empire had long flourished; exhorting them to the contempt of the world,
preparation for afflictions, denying themselves, and their own honors, by the hopes of an unseen reward,
things so repugnant to flesh and blood; and these instruments concurring in the same story, with an
admirable harmony in all parts, and sealing this doctrine with their blood; can we upon all this, ascribe
this doctrine to a human contrivance, or fix any lower author of it than the wisdom of heaven? It is the
wisdom of God that carries on his own designs in methods most suitable to his own greatness, and
different from the customs and modes of men, that less of humanity, and more of divinity might appear.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) The wisdom of God appears in the ways and manner, as well as in the instruments of its
propagation, by ways seemingly contrary. You know how God had sent the Jews into captivity in
Babylon, and though he struck off their chains, and restored them to their country, yet many of them had
no mind to leave a country wherein they had been born and bred. The distance from the place of the
original of their ancestors, and their affection to the country wherein they were born, might have
occasioned their embracing the idolatrous worship of the place. Afterwards the persecutions of Antiochus
scattered many of the Jews for their security into other nations; yet a great part, and perhaps the greatest,
preserved their religion, and by that were obliged to come every year to Jerusalem to offer, and so were
present at the effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and were witnesses of the miraculous effects
of it. Had they not been dispersed by persecution, had they not resided in several countries, and been
acquainted with their languages, the gospel had not so easily been diffused into several countries of the
world. The first persecutions also raised against the church, propagated the gospel; the scattering of the
disciples enflamed their courage, and dispersed the doctrine (Acts 8:3), according to the prophecy of
Daniel (12:4): “Many should run to and fro, and knowledge should be increased.” The flights and
hurryings of men should enlarge the territories of the gospel. There was not a tribunal, but the primitive
Christians were cited to; not a horrible punishment, but was inflicted apon them. Treated they were, as the
dregs and offals of mankind, as the common enemies of the world; yet the flames of the martyrs
brightened the doctrine, and the captivity of its professors made way for the throne of its empire. The
imprisonment of the ark was the downfall of Dagon. Religion grew stronger by sufferings, and
Christianity taller by injuries. What can this be ascribed to, but the conduct of a wisdom superior to that of
men and devils, defeating the methods of human and hellish policy; thereby making the “wisdom of this
world foolishness with God” (1 Cor. 3:19)?
</p>
<p>
     V. The Use, 1. Of Information. If wisdom be an excellency of the Divine nature; then,
</p>
<p>
     1. Christ’s Deity may hence be asserted. Wisdom is the emphatical title of Christ in Scripture (Prov.
8:12, 13, 31), where wisdom is brought in speaking as a distinct person; ascribing counsel, and
understanding, and the knowledge of witty inventions to itself. He is called also the power of God, and the
wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:24). And the ancients generally understood that place (Col. 2:3), “In him are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” as an assertion of the Godhead of Christ, in regard of the
infiniteness of his knowledge; referring wisdom to his knowledge of divine things; and knowledge to his
understanding of all human things. But the natural sense of the place seems to be this, that all wisdom and
knowledge is displayed by Christ in the gospel; and the words, ἐν αὐτῶν, refer either to Christ, or the
mystery of God spoken of, (ver. 2). But the Deity of Christ, in regard of infinite wisdom, may be deduced
from his creation of things, and his government of things; both which are ascribed to him in Scripture.
The first ascribed to him (John 1:3): “All things were made by him;” and without him was not any thing
made, that was made.” The second (John 5:22): “The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son;” and
both put together (Col. 2:16, 17). Now since he hath the government of the world, he hath the perfections
necessary to so great a work. As the creation of the world, which is ascribed to him, requires an infinite
power, so the government of the world requires an infinite wisdom. That he hath the knowledge of the
hearts of men, was proved in handling the omniscience of God. That knowledge would be to little purpose
without wisdom to order the motions of men’s hearts, and conduct all the qualities and actions of
creatures, to such an end as is answerable to a wise government; we cannot think so great an employment
can be without an ability necessary for it. The government of men and angels is a great part of the glory of
God; and if God should entrust the greatest part of his glory in hands unfit for so great a trust, it would be
an argument of weakness in God, as it is in men, to pitch upon unfit instruments for particular charges;
since God hath therefore committed to him his greatest glory, the conduct of all things for the highest end,
he hath a wisdom requisite for so great an end, which can be no less than infinite. If then Christ were a
finite person, he would not be capable of an infinite communication; he could not be a subject wherein
infinite wisdom could be lodged; for the terms finite and infinite are so distant, that they cannot
commence one another; finite can never be changed into infinite, no more than infinite can into finite.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Hence we may assert the right and fitness of God for the government of the world, as he is the
wisest Being. Among men, those who are excellent in judgment, are accounted fittest to preside over, and
give orders to others; the wisest in a city are most capable to govern a city; or at least, though ignorant
men may bear the title, yet the advice of the soundest and skilfullest heads should prevail in all public
affairs: we see in nature, that the eye guides the body, and the mind directs the eye. Power and wisdom
are the two arms pf authority; wisdom knows the end, and directs the means; power executes the means
designed for such an end.803 The more splendid and strong those are in any, the more authority results
from thence, for the conduct of others that are of an inferior orb; now God being infinitely excellent in
both, his ability and right to the management of the world cannot be suspected; the whole world is but one
commonwealth, whereof God is the monarch. Did the government of the world depend upon the election
of men and angels, where could they itch, or where would they find perfections capable of so great a work
but in the Supreme Wisdom? His wisdom hath already been apparent in those laws, whereby he formed
the world into a civil society, and the Israelites into a commonwealth. The one suited to the consciences
and reasons of all his subjects, and the other suited to the genius of that particular nation, drawn out of the
righteousness of the moral law, and applicable to all cases that might arise among them in their
government; so that Moses asserts, that the wisdom apparent in their laws enacted by God, as their chief
magistrate, would render them famous among other nations, in regard of their wisdom, as well as their
righteousness (Deut. 4:6, 7, 9). Also, this perfection doth evidence, that God doth actually govern the
world. It would not be a commendable thing for a man to make a curious piece of clock-work, and take no
care for the orderly motion of it. Would God display so much of his skill in framing the heaven and earth,
and none in actual guidance of them to their particular and universal ends? Did he lay the foundation in
order, and fit every stone in the building, make all things in weight and measure, to let them afterwards
run at hap-hazard? Would he bring forth his power to view in the creation, and let a more glorious
perfection lie idle, when it had so large a field to move in? Infinite wisdom is inconsistent with inactivity.
All prudence doth illustrate itself in untying the hardest knots, and disposing the most difficult affairs to a
happy and successful issue. All those various arts and inventions arnong men which lend their assisting
hand to one another, and those various employments their several geniuses lead them to, whereby they
support one another’s welfare, are beams and instincts of Divine wisdom in the government of the world.
He that “made all things in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24), would not leave his works to act and move only
according to their own folly, and idly behold them jumble together, and run counter to that end he
designed them for; we must not fancy Divine wisdom to be destitute of activity.
</p>
<p>
    3. Here we may see a ground of God’s patience. The most impotent persons are the most impatient,
when unforeseen emergencies arise; or at events expected by them, when their feeble prudence was not a
sufficient match to contest with them, or prevent them, But the wiser any man is, the more he bears with
those things which seem to cross his intentions, because he knows he grasps the whole affair, and is sure
of attaining the end he proposeth to himself; yet, as a finite wisdom can have but a finite patience, so an
infinite wisdom possesses an infinite patience. The wise God intends to bring glory to himself, and good
to some of his creatures, out of the greatest evils that can happen in the world, he beholds no exorbitant
afflictions and monstrous actions, but what he can dispose to a good and glorious end, even to “work
together for good to them that love God” (Rom. 8:28); and, therefore, doth not presently fall foul upon the
actors, till he hath wrought out that temporary glory to himself, and good to his people which he designs.
The times of ignorance God winked at, till he had brought his Son into the world, and manifested his
wisdom in redemption, and when this was done he presseth men to a “speedy repentance” (Acts 17:30);
that, as he forbore punishing their crimes, in order to the displaying his wisdom in the designed
redemption; so when he had effected it, they must forbear any longer abusing his patience.
</p>
<p>
     4. Hence appears the immutability of God in his decrees. He is not destitute of a power and strength to
change his own purposes, but his infinite perfection of wisdom is a bar to his laying aside his eternal
resolves and forming new ones (Isa. 46:10); he resolves the end from the beginning, and his counsel
stands; stands immovable, because it is his counsel. It is an impotent counsel, that is subject to a daily
thwarting itself. Inconstant persons are accounted, by men, destitute of a due measure of prudence. If God
change his mind it is either for the better or the worse; if for the better, he was not wise in his former
purpose; if for the worse, he is not wise in his present resolve. No alteration can be without a reflection of
weakness upon the former or present determination. God must either cease to be as wise as he was before,
or begin to be wiser than he was before the change, which to think or imagine is to deny a Deity. If any
man change his resolution, he is apprehensive of a flaw in his former purpose, and finds an inconvenience
in it, which moves him to such a change, which must be either for want of foresight in himself, or want of
a due consideration of the object of his counsel, neither of which can be imagined of God without a denial
of the Deity. No, there are no blots and blemishes in his purposes and promises. Repentance, indeed, is an
act of wisdom in the creature, but it presupposeth folly in his former actions, which is inconsistent with
infinite perfection. Men are often too rash in promising; and, therefore, what they promise in haste, they
perform at leisure, or not at all: they consider not before they vow, and make after-inquiries, whether they
had best stand to it. The only wise God needs not any after-game: as he is sovereignly wise, he sees no
cause of reversing anything, and wants not expedients for his own purpose; and as he is infinitely
powerful, he hath no superior to hinder him from executing his will, and making his people enjoy the
effects of his wisdom. If he had a recollection of thoughts, as man hath, and saw a necessity to mend
them, he were not infinitely wise in his first decrees: as in creation he looked back upon the several pieces
of that goodly frame he had erected, and saw them so exact that he did not take up his pencil again to
mend any particle of the first draught, so his promises are made with such infinite wisdom and judgment,
that what he writes is irreversible and forever, as the decrees of the Medes and Persians. All the words of
God are eternal because they are the births of righteousness and judgment (Hos. 2:19); “I will betroth thee
to me forever, in righteousness and judgment.” He is not of a wavering and flitting discretion: if he
threatens, he wisely considers what he threatens; if he promises, he wisely considers what he promises;
and therefore is immutable in both.
</p>
<p>
     5. Hence it follows that God is a fit object for our trust and confidence: for God being infinitely wise,
when he promises anything, he sees everything which may hinder, and everything which may promote the
execution of it, so that he cannot discover anything afterwards that may move him to take up after-
thoughts: he hath more wisdom than to promise anything hand over head, or anything which he knows he
cannot accomplish. Though God, as true, be the object of our trust, yet God, as wise, is the foundation of
our trust. We trust him in his promise; the promise was made by mercy, and it is performed by truth; but
wisdom conducts all means to the accomplishment of it. There are many men, whose honesty we can
confide in, but whose discretion we are diffident of: but there is no defect, either of the one or the other,
which may scare us from a depending upon God in our concerns. The words of man’s wisdom the apostle
entitles “enticing” (1 Cor. 2:4), in opposition to the words of God’s wisdom, which are firm, stable, and
undeniable demonstrations. As the power of God is an encouragement of trust, because he is able to
effect, so the wisdom of God comes into the rank of those attributes which support our faith. To put a
confidence in him, we must be persuaded, not only that he is ignorant of nothing in the world, but that he
is wise to manage the whole course of nature, and dispose of all his creatures, for the bringing his
purposes and his promises to their designed perfection.
</p>
<p>
     6. Hence appears the necessity of a public review of the management of the world, and of a day of
judgment. As a day of judgment may be inferred from many attributes of God, as his sovereignty, justice,
omniscience, &amp;c., so, among the rest, from this of wisdom. How much of this perfection will lie unveiled
and obscure, if the sins of men be not brought to view, whereby the ordering the unrighteous actions of
men, by his directing and over-ruling hand of providence, in subserviency to his own purposes and his
people’s good, may appear in all its glory! Without such a public review, this part of wisdom will not be
clearly visible; how those actions, which had a vile foundation in the hearts and designs of men, and were
formed there to gratify some base lust, ambition, and covetousness, &amp;c. were, by a secret wisdom
presiding over them, conducted to amazing ends. It is a part of Divine wisdom to right itself, and convince
men of the reasonableness of its laws, and the unreasonableness of their contradictions to it. The
execution of the sentence is an act of justice, but the conviction of the reasonableness of the sentence is an
act of wisdom, clearing up the righteousness of the proceeding; and this precedes, and the other follows
(Jude 15); “To convince all that are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds.” that wisdom which contrived
satisfaction, as well as that justice which required it, is concerned in righting the law which was enacted
by it. The wisdom of a sovereign Lawgiver is engaged not to see his law vilified and trampled on, and
exposed to the lusts and affronts of men, without being concerned in vindicating the honor of it. It would
appear a folly to enact and publish it, if there were not a resolution to right and execute it. The wisdom of
God can no more associate iniquity and happiness together, than the justice of God can separate iniquity
from punishment. It would be defective, if it did always tamely bear the insolences of offenders, without a
time of remark of their crimes, and a justification of the precept, rebelliously spurned at. He would be
unwise, if he were unjust; unrighteousness hath no better a title in Scripture than that of folly. It is no part
of Wisdom to give birth to those laws which he will always behold ineffectual, and neither vindicate his
law by a due execution of the penalty, nor right his own authority, contemned in the violation of his law,
by a just revenge: besides, what wisdom would it be for the Sovereign Judge to lodge such a spokesman
for himself as conscience in the soul of man, if it should be alway found speaking, and at length be found
false in all that it speaks? There is, therefore, an apparent prospect of the day of account, from the
consideration of this perfection of the Divine nature.
</p>
<p>
     7. Hence we have a ground for a mighty reverence and veneration of the Divine Majesty. Who can
contemplate the sparklings of this perfection in the variety of the works of his hands, and the exact
government of all his creatures, without a raised admiration of the excellency of his Being, and a falling
flat before him, in a posture of reverence to so great a Being? Can we behold so great a mass of matter,
digested into several forms, so exact a harmony and temperament in all the creatures, the proportions of
numbers and measures, and one creature answering the ends and designs of another, the distinct beauties
of all, the perpetual motion of all things without checking one another; the variety of the nature of things,
and all acting according to their nature with an admirable agreement, and all together, like different
strings upon an instrument, emitting divers sounds, but all reduced to order in one delightful lesson;—I
say, can we behold all this without admiring and adoring the Divine wisdom, which appears in all? And
from the consideration of this, let us pass to the consideration of his wisdom in redemption, in reconciling
divided interests, untying hard knots, drawing one contrary out of another; and we must needs
acknowledge that the wisdom of all the men on earth, and angels in heaven, is worse than nothing and
vanity in comparison of this vast Ocean. And as we have a greater esteem for those that invent some
excellent artificial engines, what reverence ought we to have for him that hath stamped an unimitable
wisdom upon all his works! Nature orders us to give honor to our superiors in knowledge, and confide in
their counsels; but none ought to be reverenced as much as God, since none equals him in wisdom.
</p>
<p>
     8. If God be infinitely wise, it shows us the necessity of our address to him, and invocation of his
Name. We are subject to mistakes, and often overseen; we are not able rightly to counsel ourselves. In
some cases, all creatures are too short-sighted to apprehend them, and too ignorant to give advice proper
for them, and to contrive remedies for their ease; but with the Lord there is counsel (Jer. 32:19), “He is
great in counsel, and mighty in working;” great in counsel to advise us, mighty in working to assist us.
We know not how to effect a design, or prevent an expected evil. We have an infinite Wisdom to go to,
that is every way skilful to manage any business we desire, to avert any evil we fear, to accomplish
anything we commit into his hands. When we know not what to resolve, he hath a counsel to “guide us”
(Psalm 73:24). He is not more powerful to effect what is needful, than wise to direct what is fitting. All
men stand in need of the help of God, as one man stands in need of the assistance of other men, and will
not do anything without advice; and he that takes advice, deserves the title of a wise man, as well as he
that gives advice. But no man needs so much the advice of another man, as all men need the counsel and
assistance of God: neither is any man’s wit and wisdom so far inferior to the prudence and ability of an
angel, as the wisdom of the wisest man and the most sharp-sighted angel, is inferior to the infinite wisdom
of God. We see, therefore, that it is best for us to go to the fountain, and not content ourselves with the
streams; to beg advice from a wisdom that is infinite and infallible, rather than from that which is finite
and fallible.
</p>
<p>
     Use 2. If wisdom be the perfection of the Divine Majesty, how prodigious is the contempt of it in the
world? In general, all sin strikes at this attribute, and is in one part or other a degrading of it: the first sin
directed its venom against this. As the devils endeavored to equal their Creator in power, so man
endeavored to equal him in wisdom: both indeed scorned to be ruled by his order; but man evidently
exalted himself against the wisdom of God, and aspired to be a sharer with him in his infinite knowledge;
would not let him be the only wise God, but cherished an ambition to be his partner. Just as if a beam
were able to imagine it might be as right as the sun; or a spark fancy it could be as full fraught with heat
as the whole element of fire. Man would not submit to the infinite wisdom of God in the prohibition of
one single fruit in the garden, when by the right of his sovereign authority, he might have granted him
only the use of one. All presumptuous sins are of this nature; they are, therefore, called reproaches of God
(Num. 15:30), “the soul that doth ought presumptuously, reproacheth the Lord.” All reproaches are either
for natural, moral, or intellectual defects. All reproaches of God must imply either a weakness or
unrighteousness in God: if unrighteousness, his holiness is denied; if weakness, his wisdom is blemished.
In general, all sin strikes at this perfection two ways.
</p>
<p>
     1. As it defaceth the wise workmanship of God. Every sin is a deforming and blemishing our own
souls, which, as they are the prime creatures in the lower world, so they have greater characters of Divine
wisdom in the fabric of them: but this image of God is ruined and broken by sin. Though the spoiling of it
be a scorn of his holiness, it is also an affront to his wisdom; for though his power was the cause of the
production of so fair a piece, yet his wisdom was the guide of his power, and his holiness the pattern
whereby he wrought it. His power effected it, and his holiness was exemplified in it; but his wisdom
contrived it. If a man had a curious clock or watch, which had cost him many years pains and the strength
of his skill to frame it; for another, after he had seen and considered it, to trample upon it, and crush it in
pieces, would argue a contempt of the artificer’s skill. God hath shown infinite art in the creation of man;
but sin unbeautifies man, and ravisheth his excellency. It cuts and slasheth the image of God stamped by
divine wisdom, as though it were an object only of scorn and contempt. The sinner in every sin acts, as if
he intended to put himself in a better posture, and in a fairer dress, than the wisdom of God hath put him
in by creation.
</p>
<p>
     2. In the slighting his laws. The laws of God are highly rational; they are drawn from the depths of the
Divine understanding, wherein there is no unclearness, and no defect. As his understanding apprehends all
things in their true reason, so his will enjoins all things for worthy and wise ends. His laws are contrived
by his wisdom for the happiness of man, whose happiness, and the methods to it, he understands better
than men or angels can do. His laws being the orders of the wisest understanding, every breach of his law
is a flying in the face of his wisdom. All human laws, though they are enforced by sovereign authority,
yet they are, or ought to be, in the composing of them, founded upon reason, and should be particular
applications of the law of nature to this or that particular emergency. The laws of God, then, who is
summa ratio, are the birth of the truest reason; though the reason of every one of them may not be so clear
to us. Every law, though it consists in an act of the will, yet doth presuppose an act of the understanding.
The act of the Divine understanding in framing the law, must be supposed to precede the act of his will in
commanding the observance of that law. So every sin against the law, is not only against the will of God
commanding, but the reason of God contriving, and a cleaving to our own reason, rather than the
understanding or mind of God: as if God had mistaken in making his law, and we had more understanding
to frame a better, and more conducing to our happiness: as if God were not wise enough to govern us, and
prescribe what we should do, and what we should avoid; as if he designed not our welfare but our
misfortune. Whereas, the precepts of God are not tyrannical edicts, or acts of mere will, but the fruits of
counsel; and, therefore, every breach of them is a real declamation against his discretion and judgment,
and preferring our own imaginations, or the suggestions of the devil, as our rule, before the results of
Divine counsel.
</p>
<p>
     While we acknowledge him wise in our opinion, we speak him foolish by our practice; when, instead
of being guided by him, we will guide ourselves. No man will question, but it is a controlling Divine
wisdom, to make alterations in his precepts; dogmatically, either to add some of their own, or expunge
any of his: and is it not a crime of the like reflection to alter them practically? When we will observe one
part of the law, and not another part; but pick and choose where we please ourselves, as our humors and
carnal interest prompt us; it is to charge that part of the law with folly, which we refuse to conform unto.
The more cunning any man is in sin, the more his sin is against Divine wisdom, as if he thought to outwit
God. He that receives the promises of God, and the “testimony of Christ, sets to his seal, that God is true”
(John 3:33). By the like strength of argument, it will undeniably follow, that he that refuseth obedience to
his precepts, sets to his seal that God is foolish. Were they not rational, God would not enjoin them; and if
they are rational, we are enemies to infinite wisdom, by not complying with them. If infinite prudence
hath made the law, why is not every part of it observed; if it were not made with the best wisdom, why is
any part of it observed? If the defacing of his image be any sin, as being a defaming his wisdom in
creation, the breaking his law is no less a sin, as being a disgracing his wisdom in his administration. ’Tis
upon this account, likely, that the Scripture so often counts sinners fools, since it is certainly inexcusable
folly to contradict undeniable and infallible Wisdom; yet this is done in the least sin: and as he that breaks
one tittle of the law, is deservedly accounted guilty of the breach of the whole (James 2:10), so he that
despiseth the least stamp of wisdom in the minutest part of the law, is deservedly counted as a contemner
of it, in the frame of the whole statute-book. But, in particular, the wisdom of God is affronted and
invaded.
</p>
<p>
     (1.) By introducing new rules and modes of worship, different from Divine institutions. Is not this a
manifest reflection on this perfection of God, as though he had not been wise enough to provide for his
own honor, and model his own service, but stood in need of our directions, and the caprichios of our
brains? Some have observed, that it is a greater sin in worship to do that we should not, than to omit what
we should perform.804 The one seems to be out of weakness, because of the high exactness of the law; and
the other out of impudence, accusing the wisdom of God of imperfection, and controlling it in its
institutions. At best, it seems to be an imputation of human bashfulness to the Supreme Sovereign; as if he
had been ashamed to prescribe all that was necessary to his own honor, but had left something to the
ingenuity and gratitude of men. Man has, ever since the foolish conceit of his old ancestor Adam,
presumed he could be as wise as God; and if he who was created upright entertained such conceits, much
more doth man now, under a mass of corruption, so capable to foment them. This hath been the continual
practice of men; not so much to reject what once they had received as Divine, but add somgthing of their
own inventions to it. The heathens renounced not the sacrificing of beasts for the expiation of their
offences (which the old world had received by tradition from Adam, and the new world, after the deluge,
from Noah). But they had blended that tradition with rites of their own, and offered creatures unclean in
themselves, and not fit to be offered to an infinitely pure Being; for the distinction of clean and unclean
was as ancient as Noah (Gen. 8:20), yea, before (Gen. 7:2). So the Jews did not discard what they had
received from God, as circumcision, the Passover, and sacrifices; but they would mix a heap of heathenish
rites with the ceremonies of Divine ordination, and practise things which he had not commanded, as well
as things which he had enjoined them. And, therefore, it is observable, that when God taxeth them with
sin, he doth not say, they brought in those things which he had forbidden into his worship; but those
things which he had not commanded, and had given no order for, to intimate, that they were not to move a
step without his rule (Jer. 7:31): “They have built the high palaces of Tophet, which I commanded them
not, neither came it into my heart;” and (Lev. 10:1); Nadab’s and Abihu’s strange fire was not
commanded; so charging them with impudence and rashness in adding something of their own, after he
had revealed to them the manner of his service, as if they were as wise as God. So loth is man to
acknowledge the supremacy of Divine understanding, and be sensible of his own ignorance. So after the
divulging of the gospel, the corruptors of religion did not fling off, but preserved the institutions of God,
but painted and patched them up with pagan ceremonies; imposed their own dreams with as much force as
the revelations of God. Thus hath the papacy turned the simplicity of the gospel into pagan pomp, and
religion into politics; and revived the ceremonial law, and raked some limbs of it out of the grave, after
the wisdom of God had rung her knell, and honorably interred her; and sheltered the heathenish
superstitions in christian temples, after the power of the gospel had chased the devils, with all their
trumpery, from their ancient habitations. Whence should this proceed, but from a partial atheism, and a
mean deceit of the Divine wisdom? As though God had not understanding enough to prescribe the form of
his own worship; and not wisdom enough to support it, without the crutches of human prudence. Human
prudence is too low to parallel Divine wisdom; it is an incompetent judge of what is fit for an infinite
Majesty. It is sufficiently seen in the ridiculous and senseless rights among the heathens; and the cruel and
devilish ones fetched from them by the Jews. What work will human wisdom make with divine worship,
when it will presume to be the director of it, as a mate with the wisdom of God! Whence will it take its
measures, but from sense, humor and fancy? as though what is grateful and comely to a depraved reason,
were as beautiful to an unspotted and Infinite Mind. Do not such tell the world, that they were of God’s
cabinet council, since they will take upon them to judge, as well as God, what is well-pleasing to him?
Where will it have the humility to stop, if it hath the presumption to add any one thing to revealed modes
of worship? How did God tax the Israelites with making idols “according to their own understanding”
(Hos. 13:2)! imagining their own understandings to be of a finer make, and a perfecter mould than their
Creator’s; and that they had fetched more light from the chaos of their own brains, than God had from
eternity in his own nature. How slight will the excuse be, God hath not forbidden this, or that, when God
shall silence men with the question, Where, or when did I command this, or that? There was no addition
to be made under the law to the meanest instrument God had appointed in his service. The sacred perfume
was not to have one ingredient more put into it, than what God had prescribed in the composition; nor was
any man upon pain of death to imitate it; nor would God endure that sacrifices should be consumed with
any other fire than that which came down from heaven. So tender is God of any invasions of his wisdom
and authority. In all things of this nature, whatsoever voluntary humility and respect to God they may be
disguised with, there is a swelling of the fleshly mind against infinite understanding, which the apostle
nauseates (Col. 2:18). Such mixtures have not been blessed by God: as God never prospered the mixtures
of several kinds of creatures, to form and multiply a new species, as being a dissatisfaction with his
wisdom as Creator; so he doth not prosper mixtures in worship, as being a conspiracy against his wisdom
as a Lawgiver. The destruction of the Jews was judged by some of their doctors to be, for preferring
human traditions before the written word; which they ground on (Isaiah 29:33): “Their fear for me was
taught by the precepts of men.” The injunctions of men were the rule of their worship, and not the
prescripts of my law.805 To conclude, such as make alterations in religion, different from the first
institution, are intolerable busy bodies, that will not let God alone with his own affairs. Vain man would
be wiser than his Maker, and be dabbling in that which is His sole prerogative.
</p>
<p>
    2. In neglecting means instituted by God. When men have risings of heart against God’s ordinances,
“they reject the counsel of the Lord against themselves,” or, in themselves (Luke 7:30), ἠθέτησαν. They
disannulled the wisdom of God, the spring of his ordinances. All neglects are disregards of Divine
prescriptions, as impertinent and unavailable to that end for which they were appointed, as not being
suited to the common dictates of reason; sometimes out of a voluntary humility, such as Peter’s was,
when he denied Christ’s condescension to wash his feet (John 13:8), and thereby judged of the comeliness
of his Master’s intention and action. Such as continually neglect the great institution of the Lord’s supper,
out of a sense of unworthiness, are in the same rank with Peter, and do, as well as he, fall under the blame
and reproof of Christ. Men would be saved, and use the means, but either means of their own
appointment, or not at all the means of God’s ordering.806 They would have God’s wisdom and will
condescend to theirs, and not theirs conformed to God’s; as if our blind judgments were fittest to make the
election of the paths to happiness.
</p>
<p>
    Like Naaman, who, when he was ordered by the prophet, for the cure of his leprosy, to “wash seven
times in Jordan,” would be the prophet’s director, and have him touch him with his hand; as if a patient,
sick of a desperate disease, should prescribe to his skilful physician what remedies he should order for his
cure, and make his own infirm reason, or his gust and palate, the rule, rather than the physician’s skill.
Men’s inquiries are, “Who will show us any good?” They rather fasten upon any means than that which
God hath ordained.807 We invert the order Divine wisdom hath established, when we would have God
save us in our own way, not in his. It is the same thing as if we would have God nourish us without bread,
and cure our disease without medicines, and increase our wealth without our industry, and cherish our
souls without his word and ordinances. It is to demand of him an alteration of his methods, and a
separation of that which he hath by his eternal judgment joined together. Therefore for a man to pray to
God to save him when he will not use the means he hath appointed for salvation, when he slights the
word, which is the instrument of salvation, is a contempt of the wisdom of Divine institutions. Also in
omissions of prayer. When we consult not with God upon emergent occasions, we trust more to our own
wisdom than God’s, and imply that we stand not in need of his conduct, but have ability to direct
ourselves, and accomplish our ends without his guidance. Not seeking God is, by the prophet, taxed to be
a reflection upon this perfection of God (Isa. 31:1, 2): “They look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither
seek the Lord” &amp;c. And the like charge he brings against them (Hos. 8:9): “They are gone up to Assyria, a
wild ass alone by himself, not consulting God.”
</p>
<p>
    3. In censuring God’s revelations and actions, if they be not according to our schemes: when we will
not submit to his plain will without penetrating into the unrevealed reason of it, nor adore his counsels
without controlling them, as if we could correct both law and gospel, and frame a better method of
redemption than that of God’s contriving. Thus men slighted the wisdom of God in the gospel, because it
did not agree with that philosophical wisdom and reason they had sucked in by education from their
masters (1 Cor. 1:21, 22), contrary to their practice in their superstitious worship, where the oracles they
thought divine were entertained with reverence, not with dispute, and though ambiguous, were not
counted ridiculous by the worshipper. How foolish is man in this wherein he would be accounted wise!
Adam, in innocence, was unfit to control the doctrine of God when the eye of his reason was clear; and
much more are we, since the depravation of our natures. The revelations of God tower above reason in its
purity, much more above reason in its mud and earthiness. The rays of Divine wisdom are too bright for
our human understandings, much more for our sinful understandings. It is base to set up reason, a finite
principle, against an infinite wisdom; much baser to set up a depraved and purblind reason against an all-
seeing and holy wisdom. If we would have a reason for all that God speaks, and all that God acts, our
wisdom must become infinite as his, or his wisdom become finite as ours. All the censures of God’s
revelations arise from some prejudicate opinions, or traditional maxims, that have enthroned themselves
in our minds, which are made the standard whereby to judge the things of God, and receive or reject them
as they agree with, or dissent from, those principles (Col. 2:8). Hence it was that the philosophers, in the
primitive times, were the greatest enemies to the gospel: and the contempt of Divine wisdom, in making
reason the supreme judge of Divine revelation, was the fruitful mother of the heresies in all ages springing
up in the church, and especially of that Socinianism, that daily insinuates itself into the minds of men.
This is a wrong to the wisdom of God. He that censures the words or actions of another, implies that he is,
in his censure, wiser than the person censured by him. It is as insupportable to determine the truth of
God’s plain dictates by our reason, as it is to measure the suitableness or unsuitableness of his actions by
the humor of our will. We may sooner think to span the sun, or grasp a star, or see a gnat swallow a
Leviathan, than fully understand the debates of eternity. To this we may refer too curious inquiries into
Divine methods, and “intruding into those things which are not revealed” (Col. 2:18). It is to affect a
wisdom equal with God, and an ambition to be of his cabinet council. We are not content to be creatures,
that is, to be every way below God; below him in wisdom, as well as power.
</p>
<p>
     4. In prescribing God’s method of acting. When we pray for a thing without a due submission to
God’s will; as if we were his counsellors, yea his tutors, and not his subjects, and God were bound to
follow our humors, and be swayed according to the judgment of our ignorance; when we would have such
a mercy which God thinks not fit to give, or have it in this method, which God designs to convey through
another channel. Thus we would have the only wise God take his measures from our passions; such a
controlling of God was Jonah’s anger about a gourd (chap. 4:1): “It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he
was very angry.” We would direct Him how to dispose of us; as though he, that had infinite wisdom to
contrive and rear the excellent fabric of the world, had not wisdom enough, without our discretions, to
place us in a sphere proper for his own ends, and the use he intends us in the universe. All the speeches of
men (would I had been in such an office, had such a charge; would I had such a mercy, in such a method,
or by such instruments,) are entrenchments upon God’s wise disposal of affairs. This imposing upon God
is a hellish disposition, and in hell we find it. The rich man in hell, that pretends some charity for his
brethren on earth, would direct God a way to prevent their ruin, by sending one from the dead to school
them, as a more effectual means than “Moses and the prophets” (Luke 16:29, 30). It is a temper also to be
found on earth; what else was the language of Saul’s saving the Amalekites’ cattle against the plain
command of God (1 Sam. 15:15)? As if God in his fury had overshot himself and overlooked his altar, in
depriving it of so great a booty for its service; as if it were an unwise thing in God, to lose the prey of so
many stately cattle, that might make the altar smoke with their entrails, and serve to expiate the sins of the
people; and therefore he would rectify that which he thought to be an oversight in God, and so magnifies
his own prudence and discretion above the Divine. We will not let God act as he thinks fit, but will be
directing him, and “teaching him knowledge” (Job 21:22.) As if God were a statue, an idol, that had eyes
and saw not, hands, but acted not; and could be turned as an image may be, to what quarter of the heaven
we please ourselves. The wisdom of God is unbiassed; he orders nothing but what is fittest for his end,
and we would have our shallow brains the bias of God’s acting. And will not God resent such an
indignity, as a reflection upon his wisdom as well as authority, when we intimate that we have better
heads than he, and that he comes short of us in understanding?
</p>
<p>
     5. In murmuring and impatience. One demands a reason, why he hath this or that cross? Why he hath
been deprived of such a comfort, lost such a venture, languisheth under such a sickness, is tormented with
such pains, oppressed by tyrannical neighbors, is unsuccessful in such designs? In these, and such like,
the wisdom of God is questioned and defamed. All impatience is a suspicion, if not a condemnation of the
prudence of God’s methods,. and would make human feebleness and folly the rule of God’s dealing with
his creatures. This is a presuming to instruct God, and a reproving him for unreasonableness in his
proceedings, when his dealings with us do not exactly answer our fancies and wishes; as if God, who
made the world in wisdom, wanted skill for the management of his creatures in it (Job 40:2): “Shall he
that contends with the Almighty, instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.” We that are not
wise enough to know ourselves, and what is needful for us; presume to have wit enough to guide God in
his dealing with us. The wisdom of God rendered Job more useful to the world by his afflictions, in
making him a pattern of patience, than if he had continued him in a confluence of all worldly comforts,
wherein he had been beneficial only in communicating his morsels to his poor neighbors. All murmuring
is a fastening error upon unerring Wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    6. In pride and haughtiness of spirit. No proud man, but sets his heart “as the heart of God” (Ezek.
27:2, 3). The wisdom of God hath given to men divers offices, set them its divers places; some have more
honorable charges, some meaner. Not to give that respect their offices and places call for, is to quarrel
with the wisdom of God, and overturn the rank and order wherein he hath placed things. It is unfit we
should affront God in the disposal of his creatures, and intimate to him by our carriage, that he had done
more wisely in placing another, and that he hath done foolishly in placing this or that man in such a
charge. Sometimes men are unworthy the place they fill; they may be set there in judgment to themselves
and others: but the wisdom of God in his management of things, is to be honored and regarded. It is an
infringing the wisdom of God, when we have a vain opinion of ourselves, and are blind to others. When
we think ourselves monarchs, and treat others as worms or flies in comparison of us. He who would
reduce all things to his own honor, perverts the order of the world, and would constitute another order
than what the wisdom of God hath established; and move them to an end contrary to the intention of God,
and charges God with want of discretion and skill.
</p>
<p>
    7. Distrust of God’s promise is an impeachment of his wisdom.
</p>
<p>
    A secret reviling of it, as if he had not taken due consideration before he past his word; or a suspicion
of his power, as if he could not accomplish his word. We trust the physician’s skill with our bodies, and
the lawyer’s counsel with our estates; but are loath to rely upon God for the concerns of our lives. If he be
wise to dispose of us, why do we distrust him? If we distrust him; why do we embrace an opinion of
wisdom? Unbelief also is a contradiction to the wisdom of God in the gospel, &amp;c., but that I have already
handled in a discourse of the nature of unbelief.
</p>
<p>
    Use 3. Of comfort. God hath an infinite wisdom, to conduct us in our affairs, rectify us in our
mistakes, and assist us in our straits. It is an inestimable privilege to have a God in covenant with us; so
wise, to communicate all good, to prevent all evil; who hath infinite ways to bring to pass his gracious
intentions towards us. “How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out” (Rom.
11:33)! His judgments or decrees are incomprehensibly wise, and the ways of effecting them are as wise
as his resolves effected by them. We can as little search into his methods of acting, as we can into his
wisdom of resolving; both his judgments and ways are unsearchable.
</p>
<p>
    1. Comfort in all straits and afflictions. There is a wisdom in inflicting them, and a wisdom in
removing them. He is wise to suit his medicines to the humor of our disease, though he doth not to the
humor of our wills: he cannot mistake the nature of our distemper, or the virtue of his own physic. Like a
skilful physician, he sometimes prescribes bitter potions, and sometimes cheering cordials, according to
the strength of the malady, and necessity of the patient, to reduce him to health. As nothing comes from
him, but what is for our good, so nothing is acted by him in a rash and temerarious way. His wisdom is as
infinite as his goodness; and as exact in managing, as his goodness is plentiful in streaming out to us. He
understands our griefs, weighs our necessities, and no remedies are bevond the reach of his contrivance.
When our feeble wits are bewildered in a maze, and at the end of their line for a rescue, the remedies
unknown to us are not unknown to God. When we know not how to prevent a danger, the wise God hath a
thousand blocks to lay in the way; when we know not how to free ourselves from an oppressive evil, he
hath a thousand ways of relief. He knows how to time our crosses, and his own blessings. The heart of a
wise God, as well as the heart of a wise man, discerns both time and judgment (Eccles. 8:5). There is as
much judgment in sending them, as judgment in removing them. How comfortable is it to think, that our
distresses, as well as our deliverances, are the fruits of infinite wisdom! Nothing is done by him too soon
or too slow; but in the true point of time, with all its due circumstances, most conveniently for his glory
and our good. How wise is God to bring the glory of our salvation out of the depths of a seeming ruin, and
make the evils of affliction subservient to the good of the afflicted.
</p>
<p>
     2. In temptations, his wisdom is no less employed in permitting them, than in bringing them to a good
issue. His wisdom in leading our Saviour to be tempted of the devil, was to fit him for our succor; and his
wisdom in suffering us to be tempted, is to fit us for his own service, and our salvation. He makes a thorn
in the flesh to be an occasion of a refreshing grace to the spirit, and brings forth cordial grapes from those
pricking brambles, and magnifies his grace by his wisdom, from the deepest subtilties of hell. Let Satan’s
intentions be what they will, he can be for him at every turn, to outwit him in his stratagems, to baffle him
in his enterprises; to make him instrumental for our good, where he designs nothing but our hurt. The
Lord hath his methods of deliverance from him (2 Pet. 2:9). “The Lord knows how to deliver the godly
out of temptation.”
</p>
<p>
     3. In denials, or delays of answers of prayer. He is gracious to hear; but he is wise to answer in an
acceptable time, and succor us in a day proper for our salvation (2 Cor. 6:2). We have partial affections to
ourselves, ignorance is natural to us (Rom. 8:26). We ask we know not what, because we ask out of
ignorance. God grants what he knows, what is fit for him to do, and fit for us to receive; and the exact
season wherein it is fittest for him to bestow a mercy. As God would have us bring forth our fruit in
season, so he will send forth his mercies in season. He is wise to suit his remedy to our condition, to time
it so, as that we shall have an evident prospect of his wisdom in it; that more of Divine skill, and less of
human, may appear in the issue. He is ready at our call; but he will not answer, till he see the season fit to
reach out his hand. He is wise to prove our faith, to humble us under the sense of our own unworthiness,
to wet our affections, to set a better estimate on the blessings prayed for, and that he may double the
blessing, as we do our devotion: but when his wisdom sees us fit to receive his goodness, he grants what
we stand in need of. He is wise to choose the fittest time, and faithful to give the best covenant mercy.
</p>
<p>
     4. In all evils threatened to the church by her enemies. He hath knowledge to foresee them, and
wisdom to disappoint them (Job 5:13); “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the
froward is carried headlong.” The church hath the wisdom of God, to enter the lists with the policy of hell.
He defeated the serpent in the first net he laid, and brought a glorious salvation out of hell’s rubbish, and
is yet as skilful to disappoint the after-game of the surpentine brood. The policy of hell, and the subtilty of
the world, are no better than folly with God (1 Cor. 3:19). All creatures are fools, as creatures, in
comparison with the Creator. The angels he chargeth with folly, much more us sinners. Depraved
understandings are not fit mates for a pure and unblemished. mind. Pharaoh, with his wisdom, finds a
grave in the sea; and Ahitophel’s plots are finished in his own murder. He breaks the enemies by his
power, and orders them by his skill to be a feast to his people (Psalm 74:14); “Thou breakest the head of
the leviathan, and gavest him to be meat to the people in the wilderness.” The spoils of the Egyptians’
carcasses, cast upon the shore, served the Israelites’ necessities (or were as meat to them); as being a
deliverance the church might. feed upon in all ages, in a wilderness condition, to maintain their faith, the
vital principle of the soul. There is a wisdom superior to the subtilties of men, which laughs at their
follies, and “hath them in derision” (Psalm 2:4). “There is no wisdom or counsel against the Lord” (Prov.
21:30). You never question the wisdom of an artist to use his file, when he takes it into his hand. Wicked
instruments are God’s axes and files; let him alone, he hath skill enough to manage them: God hath too
much affection to destroy his people, and wisdom enough to beautify them by the worst tools he uses. He
can make all things conspire to a perfect harmony for his own ends, and his people’s good, when they see
no way to escape a danger feared, or attain a blessing wanted.
</p>
<p>
     Use 4. For Exhortation. I. Meditate on the wisdom of God in creation and government. How little do
we think of God when we behold his works! Our sense dwells upon the surface of plants and animals,
beholds the variety of their colors, and the progress in their motion; our reason studies the qualities of
them; our spirits seldom take a flight to the Divine wisdom which framed them. Our senses engross our
minds from God, that we scarce have a thought free to bestow upon the Maker of them, but only on the
by. The constancy of seeing things that are common stifles our admiration of God, due upon the sight of
them. How seldom do we raise our souls as far as heaven, in our views of the order of the world, the
revolutions of the seasons, the nature of the creatures that are common among us, and the mutual
assistance they give to each other! Since God hath manifested himself in them, to neglect the
consideration of them is to neglect the manifestation of God, and the way whereby he hath transmitted
something of his perfections to our understanding. It renders men inexcusably guilty of not glorifying of
God (Rom. 1:19, 20). We can never neglect the meditation of the creatures, without a blemish cast upon
the Creator’s wisdom. As every river can conduct us to the sea, so every creature points us to an ocean of
infinite wisdom. Not the minutest of them, but rich tracts of this may be observed in them, and a due
sense of God result from them. They are exposed to our view, that something of God may be lodged in
our minds; that, as our bodies extract their quintessence for our nourishment, so our minds may extract a
quintessence for the Maker’s praise. Though God is principally to be praised, in and for Christ, yet, as
grace doth not rase out the law of nature, so the operations of grace put not the dictates of nature to
silence, nor suspend the homage due to God upon our inspection of his works. God hath given full
testimonies of this perfection in the heavenly bodies, dispersing their light, and distributing their
influences to every part of the world; in framing men into societies, giving them various dispositions for
the preservation of governments; making some wise for counsel, others martial for action; changing old
empires, and raising new. Which way soever we cast our eyes, we shall find frequent occasions to cry out,
“O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God” (Rom. 11:33)! To this purpose, we
must not only look upon the bulk and outside of his works, but consider from what principles they were
raised, in what order disposed, and the exact symmetry and proportion of their parts. When a man comes
into a city or temple, and only considers the surface of the buildings, they will amaze his sense, but not
better his understanding, unless he considers the methods of the work, and the art whereby it was erected.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) This was an end for which they were created. God did not make the world for man’s use only, but
chiefly for his own glory; for man’s use to enjoy his creatures, and for his own glory to be acknowledged
in his creatures, that we may consider his art in framing them, and his skill in disposing them, and not
only gaze upon the glass without considering the image it represents, and acquainting ourselves whose
image it is. The creatures were not made for themselves, but for the service of the Creator, and the service
of man. Man was not made for himself, but for the service of the Lord that created him. He is to consider
the beauty of the creation, that he may thereby glorify the Creator. He knows in art their excellentcy; the
creatures themselves, do not. If, therefore, man be idle and unobservant of them, he deprives God of the
glory of his wisdom, which he should have by his creatures. The inferior creatures themselves cannot
observe it. If man regard it not, what becomes of it? His glory can only be handed to him by man. The
other creatures cannot be active instruments of his glory, because they know not themselves, and therefore
cannot render him an active praise. Man is, therefore, bound to praise God for himself, and for all his
creatures, because he only knows himself, and the perfections of the creatures, and the Author both of
himself and them. God created such variety, to make a report of himself to us; we are to receive the
report, and to reflect it back to him. To what purpose did he make so many things, not necessary, for the
support and pleasure of our lives, but that we should behold him in them, as well as in the other? We
cannot behold the wisdom of God in his own essence, and eternal ideas, but by the reflection of it in the
creatures: as we cannot steadily behold the sun with our eye, but either through a glass, or by reflection of
the image of it in the water. God would have us meditate on his perfections; he therefore chose the same
day wherein he reviewed his work and rested from it, to be celebrated by man for the contemplation of
him (Gen. 2:2, 3), that we should follow his example, and rejoice, as himself did, in the frequent reviews
of his wisdom and goodness in them. In vain would the creatures afford matter for this study, if they were
wholly neglected. God offers something to our consideration in every creature. Shall the beams of God
shine round about us, and strike our eyes, and not affect our minds? Shall we be like ignorant children,
that view the pictures, or point to the letters in a book, without any sense and meaning? How shall God
have the homage due to him from his works, if man hath no care to observe them? The 148th Psalm is an
exhortation to this. The view of them should often extract from us a wonder of the like nature of that of
David’s (Psalm 104:24): “O Lord, how wonderful are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made them all!”
The world was not created to be forgotten, nor man created to be unobservant of it.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) If we observe not the wisdom of God in the views of the creatures, we do no more than brutes. To
look upon the works of God in the world, is no higher an act than mere animals perform. The glories of
heaven, and beauties of the earth, are visible to the sense of beasts and birds. A brute beholds the motion
of a man, as it may see the wheels of a clock, but understands not the inward springs of motion; the end
for which we move, or the soul that acts us in our motion; much less that Invisible Power which presides
over the creatures, and conducts their motion. If a man do no more than this, he goes not a step beyond a
brutish nature, and may very well acknowledge himself with Asaph, a foolish and ignorant beast before
God (Psalm 73:22). The world is viewed by beasts, but the Author of it to be contemplated by man. Since
we are in a higher rank than beasts, we owe a greater debt than beasts; not only to enjoy the creatures, as
they do, but behold God in the creatures, which they cannot do. The contemplation of the reason of God
in his works, is a noble and suitable employment for a rational creature: we have not only sense to
perceive them, but souls to mind them. The soul is not to be without its operation: where the operation of
sense ends, the work of the soul ought to begin. We travel over them by our senses, as brutes; but we must
pierce further by our understandings, as men, and perceive and praise Him that lies invisible in his visible
manufactures. Our senses are given us as servants to the soul, and our souls bestowed upon us for the
knowledge and praise of their and our common Creator.
</p>
<p>
    (3.) This would be a means to increase our humility. We should then flag our wings, and vail our sails,
and acknowledge our own wisdom to be as a drop to the ocean, and a shadow to the sun. We should have
mean thoughts of the nothingness of our reason, when we consider the sublimity of the Divine wisdom.
Who can seriously consider the sparks of infinite skill in the creature, without falling down at the feet of
the Divine Majesty, and acknowledge himself a dark and foolish creature (Psalm 8:4, 5)? When the
Psalmist considered the heavens, the moon, and stars, and God’s ordination and disposal of them, the use
that results from it is, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?” We should no more think to mate him
in prudence, or set up the spark of our reason to vie with the sun. Our reason would more willingly submit
to the revelation, when the characters of Divine wisdom are stamped upon it, when we find his wisdom in
creation incomprehensible to us.
</p>
<p>
    (4.) It would help us in our acknowledgments of God, for his goodness to us. When we behold the
wisdom of God in creatures below us, and how ignorant they are of what they possess, it will cause us to
reflect upon the deeper impressions of wisdom in the frame of our own bodies and souls, an excellency
far superior to theirs; this would make us admire the magnificence of his wisdom and goodness, sound
forth his praise for advancing us in dignity above other works of his hands, and stamping on us, by
infinite art, a nobler image of himself. And by such a comparison of ourselves with the creatures below
us, we should be induced to act excellently, according to the nature of our souls; not brutishly, according
to the nature of the creatures God hath put under our feet.
</p>
<p>
    (5.) By the contemplation of the creatures, we may receive some assistance in clearing our knowledge
in the wisdom of redemption. Though they cannot of themselves inform us of it, yet since God hath
revealed his redeeming grace, they can illustrate some particulars of it to us. Hence the Scripture makes
use of the creatures, to set forth things of a higher orb to us: our Saviour is called a Sun, a Vine, and a
Lion; the Spirit likened to a dove, fire, and water. The union of Christ and his church, is set forth by the
marriage union of Adam and Eve. God hath placed in corporeal things the images of spiritual, and
wrapped up in his creating wisdom the representations of his redeeming grace: whence some call the
creatures, natural types of what was to be transacted in a new formation of the world, and allusions to
what God intended in and by Christ.
</p>
<p>
     (6.) The meditation of God’s wisdom in the creatures is, in part, a beginning of heaven upon earth. No
doubt but there will be a perfect opening of the model of Divine wisdom. Heaven is for clearing what is
now obscure, and a full discovering of what seems at present intricate (Psalm 36:9.): In his light shall we
see light: all the light in creation, government, and redemption. The wisdom of God in the new heavens,
and the new earth, would be to little purpose, if that also were not to be regarded by the inhabitants of
them. As the saints are to be restored to the state of Adam, and higher; so they are to be restored to the
employment of Adam, and higher: but his employment was, to behold God in the creatures. The world
was so soon depraved, that God had but little joy in, and man but little knowledge of his works. And since
the wisdom of God in creation is so little seen by our ignorance here, would not God lose much of the
glory of it, if the glorified souls should lose the understanding of it above? When their darkness shall be
expelled, and their advantages improved; when the eye that Adam lost shall be fully restored, and with a
greater clearness; when the creature shall be restored to its true end, and reason to its true perfection
(Rom. 8:21, 22); when the fountains of the depths of nature and government shall be opened, knowledge
shall increase, and according to the increase of our knowledge, shall the admiration of Divine wisdom
increase also. The wisdom of God in creation was not surely intended to lie wholly unobserved in the
greatest part of it; but since there was so little time for the full observation of it, there will be a time
wherein the wisdom of God shall enjoy a resurrection, and be fully contemplated by his understanding
and glorified creature.
</p>
<p>
     Exhort. 2. Study and admire the wisdom of God in redemption. This is the duty of all Christians. We
are not called to understand the great depth of philosophy; we are not called to a skill in the intricacies of
civil government, or understand all the methods of physic; but we are called to be Christians, that is,
studiers of Divine evangelical wisdom. There are first principles to be learned; but not those principles to
be rested in without a further progress (Heb. 6:1): “Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of
Christ, let us go on to perfection.” Duties must be practised, but knowledge is not to be neglected. The
study of Gospel mysteries, the harmony of Divine truths, the sparkling of Divine wisdom, in their mutual
combination to the great ends of God’s glory and man’s salvation, is an incentive to duty, a spur to
worship, and particularly to the greatest and highest part of worship, that part which shall remain in
heaven; the admiration and praise of God, and delight in him. If we acquaint not ourselves with the
impressions of the glory of Divine wisdom in it, we shall not much regard it as worthy our observance in
regard of that duty. The gospel is a mystery; and, as a mystery, hath something great and magnificent in it
worthy of our daily inspection; we shall find fresh springs of new wonders, which we shall be invited to
adore with a religious astonishment. It will both raise and satisfy our longings. Who can come to the
depths of “God manifested in the flesh?” How amazing is it, and unworthy of a slight thought, that the
death of the Son of God should purchase the happy immortality of a sinful creature, and the glory of a
rebel be wrought by the ignominy of so great a person! that our Mediator should have a nature whereby to
covenant with his Father, and a nature whereby to he a Surety for the creature! How admirable is it, that
the fallen creature should receive an advantage by the forfeiture of his happiness! How mysterious is it,
that the Son of God should bow down to death upon a cross for the satisfaction of justice; and rise
triumphantly out of the grave, as a declaration, that justice was contented and satisfied! that he should be
exalted to heaven to intercede for us; and at last return into the world to receive us, and invest us with a
glory forever with himself! Are these things worthy of a careless regard, or a blockish amazement? What
understanding can pierce into the depths of the divine doctrine of the incarnation and birth of Christ; the
indissoluble union of the two natures? What capacity is able to measure the miracles of that wisdom,
found in the whole draught and scheme of the gospel? Doth it not merit, then, to be the object of our daily
meditation? How comes it to ass, then, that we are so little curious to concern our thoughts in those
wonders, that we scarce taste or sip of these delicacies? that we busy ourselves in trifles, and consider
what we shall eat, and in what fashion we shall be dressed; please ourselves with the ingeniousness of a
lace or feather; admire a moth-eaten manuscript, or some half-worn piece of antiquity, and think our time
ill-spent in the contemplating and celebrating that wherein God hath busied himself, and eternity is
designed for the perpetual expressions of? How inquisitive are the blessed angels! with what vigor do
they renew their daily contemplations of it, and receive a fresh contentment from it; still learning, and still
inquiring (1 Pet. 1:12)! Their eye is never off the mercy-seat; they strive to see the bottom of it, and
employ all the understanding they have to conceive the wonders of it. Shall the angels be ravished with it
and bend themselves down to study it, who have but little interest in it in comparison of us, for whom it
was both contrived and dispensed;—and shall not our pains be greater for this hidden treasure? Is not that
worthy the study of a rational creature, that is worthy the study of the angelical? There must indeed be
pains; it is expressed by “digging” (Prov. 2:4). A lazy arm will not sink to the depth of a mine. The
neglect of meditating on it is inexcusable, since it hath the title and character of the wisdom of God. The
ancient prophets searched into it, when it was folded up in shadows, when they saw only the fringes of
Wisdom’s garment (1 Pet. 1:10); and shall not we, since the sun hath mounted up in our horizon, and
sensibly scattered the light of the knowledge of this and the other perfections of God? As the Jewish
sabhath was appointed to celebrate the perfections of God, discovered in creation, so is the Christian
sabhath appointed to meditate on, and bless God, for the discovery of his perfections in redemption. Let
us, therefore, receive it according to its worth: let it be our only rule to walk by. It is worthy to be valued
above all other counsels; and we should never think of it without the doxology of the apostle, “To the
only wise God be glory through Jesus Christ, for ever!” that our speculations may end in affectionate
admirations, and thanksgivings, for that which is so full of wonders. What a little prospect should we have
had of God, and the happiness of man, had not his wisdom and goodness revealed these things to us! The
gospel is a marvellous light, and should not be regarded with a stupid ignorance, and pursued with a
duller practice.
</p>
<p>
    Exhort. 3. Let none of us be proud of, or trust in our own wisdom. Man, by affecting wisdom out of
the way of God, got a crack in his head, which hath continued five thousand years and upwards, and ever
since our own wisdom and “knowledge hath perverted us” (Isa. 47:10). To be guided by this, is to be
under the conduct of a blind leader, and follow a traitor and enemy to God and ourselves. Man’s prudence
often proves hurtful to him: he often accomplisheth his ruin, while he designs his establishment; and finds
his fall, where he thought to settle his fortune: such bad eyes hath human wisdom often in its own affairs.
Those that have been heightened with a conceit of their own cunning, have at last proved the greatest
fools. God delights to make “foolish the wisdom of this world” (1 Cor. 1:20). Thus God writ folly upon
the crafty brains of Ahithophel, and simplicity upon the subtle projects of Herod against our Saviour; and
the devil, the prince of carnal wisdom, was befooled into a furthering our redemption by his own projects
to hinder it. Carnal policy, against the prescripts of Divine wisdom, never prospers: it is like an ignis
fatuus, which leads men out of the way of duty, and out of the way of security, and perverts them into the
mire and dangerous precipices. When Jeroboam would coin a religion to serve his interest of state, he tore
up the foundations both of his kingdom and family. The way the Jews took to prevent a fresh invasion of
the Romans, by the crucifying Christ, brought the judgment more swift upon them (John 11:48). There is
no man ruined here, or damned hereafter, but by his own wisdom and will. (Prov. 3:5, 7), “The fear of the
Lord, and departure from evil, are inconsistent with an overweening conceit of our own wisdom;” and
leaning to our own understanding, is inconsistent with a trusting in the Lord with all our hearts. It is as
much a deifying ourselves, to trust to our own wit, as it is a deifying the creature to affect or confide in it,
superior to God or equally with him. The true way to wisdom is to be sensible of our own folly (1 Cor.
3:18), “If any man be wise, let him become a fool.” He that distrusts his own guidance, will more securely
and successfully follow the counsel of another in whom he confides. The more water, or any other liquor,
is poured out of a vessel, the more air enters. The more we distrust our own wisdom, the more capable we
are of the conduct of God’s. Had Jehoshaphat relied upon his own policy, he might have found a defeat
when he met with a deliverance; but he disowned his own skill and strength in telling God, “We know not
what to do, but our eyes are upon thee” (2 Chron. 20:12). Let us, therefore, with Agur, disesteem our own
understanding to esteem Divine. Human prudence is like a spider’s web, easily blown away, and swept
down by the besom of some unexpected revolution. God, by his infinite wisdom, can cross the wisdom of
man, and make a man’s own prudence hang in his own light. (Isa. 29:14), “The understanding of their
prudent men shall be hid.”
</p>
<p>
    Exhort. 4. Seek to God for wisdom. The wisdom we have by nature, is like the weeds the earth brings
forth without tillage. Our wisdom since the fall, is the wisdom of the serpent, without the innocency of the
dove: it flows from self-love, runs into self-interest. It is the wisdom of the flesh, and a prudence to
manage means for the contending our lusts. Our best wisdom is imperfect, a mere nothing and vanity, in
comparison of the Divine, as our beings are in comparison of his essence. We must go to God for a holy
and innocent wisdom, and fill our cisterns from a pure fountain. The wisdom that was the glory of
Solomon, was the donation of the Most High. (James 1:5), “If any man want wisdom, let him ask of God,
that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” The faculty of
understanding is from God by nature; but a heavenly light to direct the understanding is from God by
grace. Children have an understanding, but stand in need of wise masters to rectify it, and form judicious
notions in it. “There is a spirit in man, but the inspiration of the Almighty gives him understanding” (Job
32:8). We must beg of God, wisdom. The gospel is the wisdom of God; the concerns of it great and
mysterious, not to be known without a “new understanding” (1 John 5:20). A new understanding is not to
be had but from the Creator of the first. The Spirit of God is the “searcher of the deep things of God;” the
revealer of them to us, and the enlightener of our minds to apprehend them; and, therefore, called a “Spirit
of wisdom and revelation” (Eph. 1:17). Christ is made wisdom to us, as well as righteousness; not only by
imputation, but effusion.808 Seek to God, therefore, for that wisdom which is like the sun, and not that
worldly wisdom which is like a shadow: for that wisdom whose effects are not so outwardly glorious, but
inwardly sweet, seek it from him, and seek it in his word, that is, the transcript of Divine wisdom;
“through his precepts understanding is to be had” (Psalm 119:104). As the wisdom of men appears in
their laws, so doth the wisdom of God in his statutes. By this means we arrive to a heavenly sagacity. If
these be rejected, what wisdom can there be in us? a dream and conceit only (Jer. 8.): “They have rejected
the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?” Who knows how to order any concerns as he ought,
or any one faculty of his soul? Therefore, desire God’s direction in outward concerns, in personal, family,
in private and public. He hath not only a wisdom for our salvation, but for our outward direction. He doth
not only guide us in the one, and leave Satan to manage us in the other. Those that go with Saul to a witch
of Endor, go to hell for craft, and prefer the wisdom of the hostile serpent before the holy counsel of a
faithful Creator. If you want health in your body, you advise with a physician; if direction for your estate,
you resort to a lawyer; if passage for a voyage, you address to a pilot; why not much more yourselves,
your all, to a wise God? As Pliny said, concerning a wise man, “O, Sir, how many Catos are there in that
wise person!” how much more wisdom than men or angels possess, is infinitely centered in the wise God!
</p>
<p>
    Exhort. 5. Submit to the wisdom of God in all cases. What else was inculcated in the first precept,
forbidding man to eat of the fruit of the “tree of knowledge of good and evil,” but that he should take heed
of the swelling of his mind against the wisdom of God? It is a wisdom incomprehensible to flesh and
blood; we should adore it in our minds, and resign up ourselves to it in our practice. How unreasonable
are repinings against God, whereby a creature’s ignorance indicts and judges a Creator’s prudence! Were
God weak in wisdom, and only mighty in power, we might suspect his conduct. Power without wisdom
and goodness is an unruly and ruinous thing in the world. But God being infinite in one, as well as the
other, we have no reason to be jealous of him, and repine against his methods; why should we quarrel
with him that we are not as high, or as wealthy as others; that we have not presently the mercy we want?
If he be wise, we ought to stay his time, and wait his leisure, because “he is a God of judgment” (Isa.
30:18). Presume not to shorten the time which his discretion hath fixed; it is a folly to think to do it. By
impatience we cannot hasten relief; we alienate him from us by debasing him to stand at our bar, disturb
ourselves, lose the comfort of our lives, and the sweetness of his mercy. Submission to God we are in no
case exempted from, because there is no case wherein God doth not direct all the acts of his will by
counsel. Whatsoever is drawn by a straight rule must be right and straight; the rule that is right in itself, is
the measure of the straightness of everything else; whatsoever is wrought in the world by God, must be
wise, good, righteous; because God is essentially wisdom, goodness, and righteousness.
</p>
<p>
    (1.) Submit to God, in his revelations. 1. Measure them not by reason: the truths of the gospel must be
received with a self-emptiness and annihilation of the creature. If our reason seems to lift up itself against
revelation, because it finds no testimony for it in its own light, consider how crazy it is in natural and
obvious things, and therefore sure it is not strong enough to enter into the depths of Divine wisdom: the
wisdom of God in the gospel is too great an ocean to be contained or laved out by a cockleshell. It were
not infinite, if it were not beyond our finite reach; our reason must as well stoop to his wisdom, as our
wills to his sovereignty. How great a vanity is it for a glow-worm to boast that it is as full of light as the
sun in the firmament! for reason to leave its proper sphere, is to fall into confusion, and thicken its own
darkness. We should settle ourselves in the belief of the Scripture, and confirm ourselves by a meditation
on those many undeniable arguments for its Divine authority,—the fulfilling of its predictions, the
antiquity of the writing, the holiness of the precepts, the heavenliness of the doctrine, the glorious effects
it hath produced, and doth yet produce, different from human methods of success; and submit our reason
to the voice of so high a majesty. 2. Not to be too curiously inquisitive into what is not revealed. There is
something hid in whatsoever is revealed. We know the Son of God was begotten from eternity, but how
he was begotten, we are ignorant. We know there is a union of the Divine nature with the human, and that
the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily; but the manner of its inhabitation we are in a great part
ignorant of. We know that God hath chosen some and refused others, and that he did it with counsel; but
the reason why he chose this man and not that, we know not; we can refer it to nothing but God’s
sovereign pleasure. It is revealed that there will be a day wherein God shall judge the world; but the
particular time is not revealed. We know that God created the world in time; but why he did not create the
world millions of years before, we are, ignorant of, and our reasons would be bewildered in their too
much curiosity. If we ask why he did not create it before, we may as well ask why he did create it then?
And may not the same question be asked, if the world had been created millions of years before it was?
That he created it in six days, and not in an instant, is revealed; but why he did not do it in a moment,
since we are sure he was able to do it, is not revealed. Are the reasons of a wise man’s proceedings hid
from us? and shall we presume to dive into the reason of the proceedings of an only wise God, which he
hath judged not expedient to discover to us? Some sparks of his wisdom he hath caused to issue out, to
exercise and delight our minds; others he keeps within the centre of his own breast; we must not go about
to unlock his cabinet. As we cannot reach to the utmost lines of his power, so we cannot grasp the
intimate reasons of his wisdom. We must still remember, that which is finite can never be able to
comprehend the reasons, motives, and methods of that which is infinite. It doth not become us to be resty,
because God hath not admitted us into the debates of eternity. We are as little to be curious at what God
hath hid, as to be careless of what God hath manifested. Too great an inquisitiveness beyond our line, is
as much a provoking arrogance, as a blockish negligence of what is revealed, is a slighting ingratitude.
</p>
<p>
    (2.) Submit to God in his precepts and methods. Since they are the results of infinite wisdom, disputes
against them are not tolerable; what orders are given out by infallible Wisdom are to be entertained with
respect and reverence, though the reason of them be not visible to our purblind minds. Shall God have
less respect from us than earthly princes, whose laws we observe without being able to pierce into the
exact reason of them all? Since we know he hath not a will without an understanding, our observance of
him must be without repining; we must not think to mend our Creator’s laws, and presume to judge and
condemn his righteous statutes. If the flesh rise up in opposition, we must cross its motions, and silence its
murmurings; his will should be an acceptable will to us, because it is a wise will in itself. God hath no
need to impose upon us and deceive us; he hath just and righteous ways to attain his glory and his
creatures’s good. To deceive us, would be to dishonor himself, and contradict his own nature. He cannot
impose false injurious precepts, or unavailable to his subjects’ happiness; not false, because of his truth;
not injurious, because of his goodness; not vain, because of his wisdom. Submit, therefore, to him in his
precepts, and in his methods too. The honor of his wisdom, and the interest of our happiness, call for it.
Had Noah disputed with God about building an ark, and listened to the scoffs of the senseless world, he
had perished under the same fate, and lost the honor of a preacher and worker of righteousness. Had not
the Israelites been their own enemies, if they had been permitted to be their own guides, and returned to
the Egyptian bondage and furnaces, instead of a liberty and earthly felicity in Canaan? Had our Saviour
gratified the Jews by descending from the cross, and freeing himself from the power of his adversaries, he
might have had that faith from them which they promised him; but it had been a faith to no purpose,
because without ground; they might have believed him to be the Son of God, but he could not have been
the Saviour of the world. His death, the great ground and object of faith, had been unaccomplished; they
had believed a God pardoning without a consent to his justice, and such a faith could not have rescued
them from falling into eternal misery. The precepts and methods of Divine wisdom must be submitted to.
</p>
<p>
     (3.) Submit to God in all crosses and revolutions. Infinite Wisdom cannot err in any of his paths, or
step the least hair’s breadth from the way of righteousness: there is the understanding of God in every
motion; an eye in every wheel, the wheel that goes over us and crusbeth us. We are led by fancy more
than reason: we know no more what we ask, or what is fit for us, than the mother of Zebedee’s children
did, when she petitioned Christ for her sons’ advancement, when he came into his temporal kingdom
(Matt. 20:22): the things we desire might pleasure our fancy or appetite, but impair our health: one man
complains for want of children, but knows not whether they may prove comforts or crosses: another for
want of health, but knows not whether the health of his body may not prove the disease of his soul. We
might lose in heavenly things, if we possess in earthly things what we long for. God, in regard of his
infinite wisdom, is fitter to carve out a condition than we ourselves; our shallow reason and self-love,
would wish for those things that are injurious to God, to ourselves, to the world; but God always chooses
what is best for his glory, and what is best for his creatures, either in regard to themselves, or as they
stand in relation to hire, or to others, as parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
     We are in danger from our self-love, in no danger in complying with God’s wisdom: when Rachel
would die, if she had no children, she had children, but death with one of them (Gen. 30:1). Good men
may conclude, that whatsoever is done by God in them, or with them, is best and fittest for them; because
by the covenant which makes over God to them, as their God, the conduct of his wisdom is assured to
them as well as any other attribute: and, therefore, as God in every transaction appears as their God, so he
appears as their wise Director, and by this wisdom he extracts good out of evil, makes the affliction which
destroys our outward comforts consume our inward defilements; and the waves which threatened to
swallow up the vessel, to cast it upon the shore: and when he hath occasion to manifest his anger against
his people, his wisdom directs his wrath. In judgment he hath “a work to do upon Zion;” and when that
work is done, he punishes the fruit of the “stout heart of the king of Assyria” (Isa. 10:12); as in the
answers of prayer he doth give oftentimes “above what we ask or think” (Eph. 3:20), so in outward
concerns he doth above what we can expect, or by our short-sightedness, conclude will be done. Let us,
therefore, in all things, frame our minds to the Divine Wisdom, and say with the Psalmist (Psalm 47:4):
“The Lord shall choose our inheritance and condition for us.”
</p>
<p>
     Exhort. 6. Censure not God in any of his ways. Can we understand the full scope of Divine wisdom in
creation, which is perfected before our eyes? Can we, by a rational knowledge, walk over the whole
surface of the earth, and wade through the sea? Can we understand the nature of the heavens? Are all, or
most, or the thousandth part of the particles of Divine skill, known by us, yea, or any of them thoroughly
known? How can we, then, understand his deeper methods in things that are but of yesterday, that we
have not had a time to view? We should not be too quick, or too rash, in our judgments of him: the best
that we attain to, is but feeble conjectures at the designs of God. As there is something bid in what soever
is revealed in his word, so there is something inaccessible to us in his works, as well as in his nature and
Majesty. In our Saviour’s act in washing his disciples’ feet, he checked Peter’s contradiction (John 13:7):
“What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.” God were not infinitely wise if the
reason of all his acts were obvious to our shallowness. He is no profound statesman, whose inward
intention can be sounded by vulgar heads at the first act he starts in his designed method. The wise God
is, in this, like wise men, that have not breasts like glasses of crystal, to discover all that they intend.
There are “secrets of wisdom above our reach” (Job 11:6); nay, when we see all his acts, we cannot see all
the draughts of his skill in them. An unskilful hearer of a musical lesson may receive the melody with his
ear, and understand not the rarities of the composition as it was wrought by the musician’s mind. Under
the Old Testament there was more of Divine power, and less of his wisdom apparent in his acts: as his
laws, so his acts, were more fitted to their sense. Under the New Testament there is more of wisdom, and
less of power; as his laws, so his acts, are more fitted to a spiritual mind; wisdom is less discernible than
power. Our wisdom, therefore, in this case, as it doth other things, consists in silence and expectation of
the end and event of a work. We owe that honor to God that we do to men wiser than ourselves, to
imagine he hath reason to do what he doth, though our shallowness cannot comprehend it. We must suffer
God to be wiser than ourselves, and acknowledge that there is something sovereign in his ways not to be
measured by the feeble reed of our weak understandings. And, therefore, we should acquiesce in his
proceedings; take heed we be not found slanderers of God, but be adorers instead of censurers; and lift up
our heads in admiration of him and his ways, instead of citing him to answer it at our bar. Many things in
the first appearance may seem to be rash and unjust, which, in the issue, appear comely and regular. If it
had been plainly spoke before that the Son of God should die, that a most holy person should be crucified,
it would have seemed cruel to expose a son to misery; unjust to inflict punishment upon one that was no
criminal; to join together exact goodness and physical evil; that the sovereign should die for the
malefactor, and the observer of the law for the violators of it. But when the whole design is unravelled,
what an admirable connexion is there of justice and mercy, love and wisdom, which before would have
appeared absurd to the muddied reason of man! We see the gardener pulling up some delightful flowers
by the roots, digging up the earth, overwhelming it with dung; an ignorant person would imagine him
wild, out of his wits, and charge him with spoiling his garden: but when the spring is arrived, the spectator
will acknowledge his skill in his former operations. The truth is, the whole design and methods of God are
not to be judged by us in this world; the full declaration of the whole contexture is reserved for the other
world, to make up a part of good men’s happiness in the amazing views of Divine wisdom, as well as the
other perfections of his nature. We can no more perfectly understand his wisdom than we can his mercy
and justice, till we see the last lines of all drawn, and the full expressions of them; we should therefore be
sober and modest in the consideration of God’s ways; “his judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past
finding out.” The riches of his wisdom are past our counting, his depths not to be fathomed, yet they are
depths of righteousness and equity; though the full manifestation of that equity, the grounds and methods
of his proceedings are unknown to us. As we are too short fully to know God, so we are too ignorant fully
to comprehend the acts of God: since he is a God of judgment, we should wait till we see the issue of his
works (Isa. 30:18). And in the meantime, with the apostle in the text, give him the glory of all, in the same
expressions, “To the only wise God be glory, through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.”
