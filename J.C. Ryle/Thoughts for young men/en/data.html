<h1>Introduction<h1>
<br>
    When the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to Titus about his responsibility as 
    a minister, he mentioned young men as a group requiring particular 
    attention. After speaking of older men and older women, and young women, he 
    adds this advice, &quot;Encourage the <i>young</i> <i>men</i> to be self-controlled&quot; (Titus 
    2:6). I am going to follow the Apostle's advice. I propose to offer a few 
    words of <i>friendly exhortation </i>to young men.</p>
<p>
    I am growing old myself, but there are few things that I can remember so 
    well as were the days of my youth. I have a most distinct recollection of 
    the joys and the sorrows, the hopes and the fears, the temptations and the 
    difficulties, the mistaken judgments and the misplaced affections, the 
    errors and the aspirations, which surround and accompany a young man's life. 
    If I can only say something to keep some young man walking in the right way, 
    and preserve him from faults and sins, which may hurt his prospects both for 
    time and eternity, I shall be very thankful. There are <i>four things </i>which I 
    propose to do:<br>
    I. I will mention some general REASONS why young men need exhorting.</p>
    II. I will note some special DANGERS which young men need to be warned 
    about.</p>
    III. I will give some general COUNSEL which I beg young men to receive.</p>
    IV. I will set down some special RULES OF CONDUCT which I strongly advise 
    young men to follow. On each of these four points I have something to say, 
    and I pray to God that what I say may do good to some soul.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h1>I. REASONS FOR EXHORTING YOUNG MEN</h1>

<p>
    What are the general reasons why young men need specific exhortation? I will 
    mention several of them in order.
</p>
    <h2>(1) For one thing, there is the painful fact that there are few young men 
    anywhere who seem to be Christians.</h2>
    I speak without respect of persons; I say it of all. Rich or poor, gentle or 
    rough, educated or uneducated, in the city or in the country — it makes no 
    difference. I shudder to think how few young men are led by the Spirit, how 
    few are on that narrow road which leads to life, how few are setting their 
    affections on things above, how few are taking up the cross, and following 
    Christ. I say all this with sorrow, but I believe, in God's sight, that I am 
    saying nothing more than the truth.</p>
<p>
    Young men, you form a large and most important class in the population of 
    this country; but where, and in what condition, are your souls? Regardless 
    of where we turn for an answer, the report will be one and the same! Let us 
    ask any faithful minister of the gospel, and note what he will tell us. How 
    many unmarried young people can he remember who come to the Lord's Supper? 
    Who are the most backward about the doctrines of salvation, the most 
    irregular about Sunday services, the most difficult to draw to weekly Bible 
    studies and prayer meetings, the most inattentive to whatever is being 
    preached? Which part of his congregation fills him with the most anxiety? 
    Who are the <i>Reubens</i> for whom he has the deepest &quot;searchings of heart&quot;? Who 
    in his flock are the hardest to manage, who require the most frequent 
    warnings and rebukes, who cause him the greatest uneasiness and sorrow, who 
    keep him most constantly in fear for their souls, and seem the most 
    hopeless? Depend on it, his answer will always be, &quot;The Young Men!&quot;</p>
<p>
    Let us ask the parents in any county throughout this land, and see what they 
    will generally say. Who in their families give them the most pain and 
    trouble? Who need the most watchfulness, and most often provoke and 
    disappoint them? Who are the first to be led away from what is right, and 
    the last to remember cautions and good advice? Who are the most difficult to 
    keep in order and limits? Who most frequently break out into open sin, 
    disgrace the name they bear, make their friends unhappy, embitter the older 
    relatives, and cause them to die with sorrow in their hearts? Depend on it, 
    the answer will generally be, &quot;The Young Men!&quot;</p>
<p>
    Let us ask the judges and police officers, and note what they will reply. 
    Who goes to the night clubs and bars the most? Who make up street gangs? Who 
    are most often arrested for drunkenness, disturbing the peace, fighting, 
    stealing, assaults, and the like? Who fill the jails, and penitentiaries, 
    and detention homes? Who are the class which requires the most incessant 
    watching and looking after? Depend on it, they will at once point to the 
    same group, they will say, &quot;The Young Men!&quot;</p>
<p>
    Let us turn to the upper classes, and note the report we will get from them. 
    In one family the sons are always wasting time, health, and money, in the 
    selfish pursuit of pleasure. In another, the sons will follow no profession, 
    and fritter away the most precious years of their life in doing nothing. In 
    another, they take up a profession as a mere form, but pay no attention to 
    its duties. In another, they are always forming wrong connections, gambling, 
    getting into debt, associating with bad companions, keeping their friends in 
    a constant fever of anxiety. Note that rank, and title, and wealth, and 
    education, do not prevent these things! Anxious fathers, and heart-broken 
    mothers, and sorrowing sisters, could tell sad stories about them, if the 
    truth were known. Many a family, with everything this world can give, 
    numbers among its relatives some name that is never named, or only named 
    with regret and shame, some son, some brother, some cousin, some nephew, who 
    will have his own way, and is a grief to all who know him.</p>
<p>
    There is seldom a rich family which hasn't got some thorn in its side, some 
    blot in its page of happiness, some constant source of pain and anxiety; and 
    often, far too often — the true cause is, &quot;The Young Men!&quot;</p>
<p>
    What shall we say to these things? These are facts, plain facts, facts which 
    meet us on every side, facts which cannot be denied. How dreadful this is! 
    How dreadful the thought, that every time I meet a young man, I meet one who 
    is in all probability an enemy of God, traveling on the wide road which 
    leads to hell, unfit for heaven! Surely, with such facts before me, will you 
    not wonder that I exhort you, you must allow that there is a good reason.</p>
    <b><br>
    (2) Death and judgment are waiting for young men, even as it waits for 
    others, and they nearly all seem to forget it.</p>
    </b><br>
    Young men, it is appointed for you to die; and no matter how strong and 
    healthy you may be now, the day of your death is perhaps very near. I see 
    young people sick as well as the elderly. I bury youthful corpses as well as 
    aged. I read the names of persons no older than yourselves in every 
    graveyard. I learn from books that, excepting infancy and old age, more die 
    between thirteen and twenty-three than at any other period of life. And yet 
    you live as if you were sure that presently you will never die.</p>
<p>
    Are you thinking you will pay attention to these things tomorrow? Remember 
    the words of Solomon, &quot;Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what 
    a day may bring forth&quot; (Proverbs 27:1). &quot;I will worry about serious things 
    tomorrow,&quot; said an unsaved person, to one who warned him of coming danger; 
    but his tomorrow never came. Tomorrow is the devil's day, but today is 
    God's. Satan does not care how spiritual your intentions are, or how holy 
    your resolutions, if only they are determined to be done tomorrow. Oh, give 
    no place to the devil in this matter! All men don't live to be elderly 
    fathers, like Isaac and Jacob. Many children die before their fathers. David 
    had to mourn the death of his two finest sons; Job lost all of his ten 
    children in one day. Your lot may be like one of theirs, and when death 
    comes, it will be vain to talk of tomorrow, you must go at once.</p>
<p>
    Do you think that you will have a more convenient time to think about these 
    things? So thought Felix and the Athenians to whom Paul preached to; but it 
    never came. The road to hell is paved with such ideas. Better make sure to 
    work while you can. Leave nothing unsettled that is eternal. Run no risk 
    when your soul is at stake. Believe me, the salvation of a soul is no easy 
    matter. Every one needs a &quot;Great salvation,&quot; whether young or old; all need 
    to be born again — all need to be washed in Christ's blood — all need to be 
    sanctified by the Spirit. Happy is that man who does not leave these things 
    uncertain, but never rests until he has the witness of the Spirit within 
    him, testifying to him that he is a child of God.</p>
<p>
    Young men, your time is short. Your days are but a brief shadow, a mist that 
    appears for a little while and then vanishes, a story that is soon told. 
    Your bodies are not made of brass. &quot;Even the young men,&quot; says Isaiah, 
    &quot;stumble and fall&quot; (Isaiah 40:30). Your health may be taken from you in a 
    moment: it only needs an accident, a fever, an inflammation, a broken 
    blood-vessel, and the worm would soon feed upon you in the grave. There is 
    but a step between any one of you and death. This night your soul might be 
    required of you. You are fast going the way of all the earth, you will soon 
    be gone. Your life is all uncertainty, your death and judgment are perfectly 
    sure. You too must hear the Archangel's trumpet, and go forth to stand 
    before the great white throne of judgment, you too must obey that summons, 
    which Jerome says was always ringing in his ears: &quot;Get up, you dead, and 
    come to judgment.&quot; &quot;Yes, I am coming soon,&quot; is the language of the Judge 
    Himself. I cannot, dare not, will not let you alone.</p>
<p>
    Oh that you would all take to heart the words of the Preacher: &quot;Be happy, 
    young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days 
    of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but 
    know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment&quot; (Ecclesiastes 
    11:9) Amazing, that with such a prospect of coming judgment, any man can be 
    careless and unconcerned! Surely none are so crazy as those who are content 
    to live unprepared to die. Surely the unbelief of men is the most amazing 
    thing in the world. The clearest prophecy in the Bible begins with these 
    words, &quot;Who has believed our message?&quot; (Isaiah 53:1). The Lord Jesus said, 
    &quot;When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot; (Luke 18:8). 
    Young men, I fear this be the report of many of you in the courts above: 
    &quot;They will not believe.&quot; I fear you be hurried out of the world, and awake 
    to find out, too late, that death and judgment are realities. I fear all 
    this, and therefore I exhort you.</p>
    <b><br>
    (3) What young men will be, in all probability depends on what they are now, 
    and they seem to forget this.</p>
    </b><br>
    Youth is the planting time of full age, the molding season in the little 
    space of human life, the turning point in the history of man's mind.</p>
<p>
    By the shoot that springs up we can judge the type of tree that is growing, 
    by the blossoms we judge the kind of fruit, by the spring we judge the type 
    of harvest coming, by the morning we judge the coming day, and by the 
    character of the young man, we may generally judge what he will be when he 
    grows up.</p>
<p>
    Young men, do not be deceived. Don't think you can, at will, serve lusts and 
    pleasures in your beginning, and then go and serve God with ease at your 
    latter end. Don't think that you can live with Esau, and then die with 
    Jacob. It is a mockery to deal with God and your souls in such a fashion. It 
    is an awful mockery to suppose you can give the flower of your strength to 
    the world and the devil, and then put off the King of kings with the scraps 
    and remains of your hearts, the wreck and remnant of your powers. It is an 
    awful mockery, and you may find to your loss that the thing cannot be done.</p>
<p>
    I dare say you are planning on a late repentance. You do not know what you 
    are doing. You are planning without God. Repentance and faith are the gifts 
    of God, and they are gifts that He often withholds, when they have been long 
    offered in vain. I grant you true repentance is never too late, but I warn 
    you at the same time, late repentance is seldom true. I grant you, one 
    penitent thief was converted in his last hours, that no man might despair; 
    But I warn you, only one was converted, that no man might presume. I grant 
    you it is written, Jesus is &quot;Able to save completely those who come to God 
    through him&quot; (Hebrews 7:25). But I warn you, it is also written by the same 
    Spirit, &quot;Since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I 
    stretched out my hand, I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock 
    when calamity overtakes you&quot; (Proverbs 1:24, 26).</p>
<p>
    Believe me, you will find it no easy matter to turn to God whenever you 
    please. It is a true saying of the godly Leighton, &quot;The way of sin is down 
    hill; a man cannot stop when he wants too.&quot; Holy desires and serious 
    convictions are not like the servants of the Centurion, ready to come and go 
    at your desire; rather they are like the unicorn in Job, they will not obey 
    your voice, nor attend at your bidding. It was said of the famous general 
    Hannibal of old, when he could have taken the city he warred against, he 
    would not, and in time when he would, he could not. Beware lest the same 
    kind of thing happens to you in the matter of eternal life.</p>
<p>
    Why do I say all this? I say it because of the force of habit. I say it 
    because experience tells me that people's hearts are seldom changed if they 
    are not changed when young. Seldom indeed are men converted when they are 
    old. Habits have deep roots. Once sin is allowed to settle in your heart, it 
    will not be turned out at your bidding. Custom becomes second nature, and 
    its chains are not easily broken. The prophet has well said, &quot;Can the 
    Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard its spots? Neither can you do good 
    who are accustomed to doing evil&quot; (Jeremiah 13:23). Habits are like stones 
    rolling down hill — the further they roll, the faster and more ungovernable 
    is their course. Habits, like trees, are strengthened by age. A boy may bend 
    an oak when it is a sapling — a hundred men cannot root it up, when it is a 
    full grown tree. A child can wade over the Thames River at its 
    fountain-head — the largest ship in the world can float in it when it gets 
    near the sea. So it is with habits: the older the stronger — the longer they 
    have held possession, the harder they will be to cast out. They grow with 
    our growth, and strengthen with our strength. Custom is the nurse of sin. 
    Every fresh act of sin lessens fear and remorse, hardens our hearts, blunts 
    the edge of our conscience, and increases our evil inclination.</p>
<p>
    Young men, you may fancy I am laying too much stress on this point. If you 
    had seen old men, as I have, on the brink of the grave, without any 
    feelings, seared, callous, dead, cold, hard as stone — you would not think 
    so. Believe me, you cannot stand still in your souls. Habits of good or evil 
    are daily strengthening in your hearts. Every day you are either getting 
    nearer to God, or further off. Every year that you continue unrepentant, the 
    wall of division between you and heaven becomes higher and thicker, and the 
    gulf to be crossed deeper and broader. Oh, dread the hardening effect of 
    constant lingering in sin! Now is the accepted time. See that your decision 
    not be put off until the winter of your days. If you do not seek the Lord 
    when young, the strength of habit is such that you will probably never seek 
    Him at all.</p>
    I fear this, and therefore I exhort you.</p>
    <b><br>
    (4) The devil uses special diligence to destroy the souls of young men, and 
    they don't seem to know it.</p>
    </b><br>
    Satan knows very well that you will make up the next generation and 
    therefore he employs every trick to make you his own. I would not have you 
    to be ignorant of his schemes.</p>
<p>
    You are those on whom he puts his choicest temptations. He spreads his net 
    with the most watchful carefulness, to entangle your hearts. He baits his 
    trap with the sweetest morsels, to get you into his power. He displays his 
    wares before your eyes with his utmost ingenuity, in order to make you buy 
    his sugared poisons, and eat his accursed treats. You are the grand object 
    of his attack. May the Lord rebuke him, and deliver you out of his hands.</p>
<p>
    Young men, beware of being taken by his snares. He will try to throw dust in 
    your eyes, and prevent you seeing anything in its true colors. He would 
    eagerly make you think that evil is good, and good is evil. He will paint, 
    cover with gold, and dress up sin, in order to make you fall in love with 
    it. He will deform, and misrepresent, and fabricate true Christianity, in 
    order to make you take a dislike to it. He will exalt the pleasures of 
    wickedness — but he will hide from you the sting. He will lift up before your 
    eyes the cross and its painfulness– but he will keep out of sight the 
    eternal crown. He will promise you everything, as he did to Christ, if you 
    will only serve him. He will even help you to wear a form of Christianity, 
    if you will only neglect the power. He will tell you at the beginning of 
    your lives, it is too soon to serve God — he will tell you at the end, it is 
    too late. Oh, do not be deceived!</p>
<p>
    You don't know the danger you are in from this enemy; and it is this very 
    ignorance which makes me afraid. You are like blind men, walking among holes 
    and pitfalls; you do not see the perils which are around you on every side.</p>
<p>
    Your enemy is mighty. He is called &quot;The Prince of this world&quot; (John 14:30). 
    He opposed our Lord Jesus Christ all through His ministry. He tempted Adam 
    and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and so brought sin and death into the 
    world. He even tempted David, the man after God's own heart, and caused his 
    latter days to be full of sorrow. He even tempted Peter, the chosen Apostle, 
    and made him deny his Lord. Surely his hostility towards man and God is to 
    be despised.</p>
<p>
    Your enemy is restless. He never sleeps. He is always going around like a 
    roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He is always going back and forth 
    in the earth, and walking up and down on it. You may be careless about your 
    souls: but he is not. He wants your soul to make you miserable, like 
    himself, and will have your soul if he can. Surely his hatred towards men 
    and God is to be despised.</p>
<p>
    And your enemy is cunning. For thousands of years he has been reading one 
    book, and that book is the heart of man. He ought to know it well, and he 
    does know it — all its weakness, all its deceitfulness, all its folly. And he 
    has a storehouse full of temptations, such as are most likely to do the 
    heart of man the most harm. Never will you go to the place where he will not 
    find you. Go into the city — he will be there. Go into the wilderness — he 
    will be there also. Sit among drunkards — and he will be there to help you. 
    Listen to preaching — and he will be there to distract you. Surely such 
    ill-will is to be despised.</p>
<p>
    Young men, this enemy is working hard for your destruction, however little 
    you may think it. You are the prize for which he is specially contending 
    for. He foresees you must either be the blessings or the curses of your day, 
    and he is trying hard to effect a place in your hearts early in your life, 
    in order that you may help advance his kingdom each day. Well does he 
    understand that to spoil the bud is the surest way to mar the flower.</p>
<p>
    Oh that your eyes were opened, like those of Elisha's servant Dothan! Oh 
    that you could see what Satan is scheming against your peace! I must warn 
    you — I must exhort you. Whether you will hear or not, I cannot, dare not, 
    leave you alone.</p>
    <b><br>
    (5) Young men need exhorting because of the sorrow it will save them, to 
    begin serving God now.</b><br>
<p>
    Sin is the mother of all sorrow, and no sort of sin appears to give a man so 
    much misery and pain as the sins of his youth. The foolish acts he did — the 
    time he wasted — the mistakes he made — the bad company he kept — the harm he 
    did himself, both body and soul — the chances of happiness he threw away — the 
    openings of usefulness he neglected; all these things that often embitter 
    the conscience of an old man, throw a gloom on the evening of his days, and 
    fill later hours of his life with self-reproach and shame.</p>
<p>
    Some men could tell you of the untimely loss of health, brought on by 
    youthful sins. Disease racks their limbs with pain, and life is almost a 
    weariness. Their muscular strength is so wasted, that the slightest weight 
    seems a burden. Their eye has become prematurely dim, and their natural 
    energy abated. The sun of their health has gone down while it is yet day, 
    and they mourn to see their flesh and body consumed. Believe me, this is a 
    bitter cup to drink.</p>
<p>
    Others could give you sad accounts of the consequences of idleness. They 
    threw away the golden opportunity for learning. They would not get wisdom at 
    the time when their minds were most able to receive it, and their memory 
    most ready to retain it. And now it is too late. They don't have the time to 
    sit down and learn. They no longer have the same power, even if they had the 
    time. Lost time can never be redeemed. This too is a bitter cup to drink.</p>
<p>
    Others could tell you of grievous mistakes in judgment, from which they 
    suffer all their lives. They had to have it their own way. They would not 
    take advice. They formed some connection which has been altogether ruinous 
    to their happiness. They chose a profession for which they were entirely 
    unsuited. And they see it all now. But their eyes are only open when the 
    mistake cannot be retrieved. Oh, this is also a bitter cup to drink!</p>
<p>
    Young men, young men, I wish you did but know the comfort of a conscience 
    not burdened with a long list of youthful sins. These are the wounds that 
    pierce the deepest. These are the arrows that drink up a man's spirit. This 
    is the iron that enters into the soul. Be merciful to yourselves. Seek the 
    Lord early, and so you will be spared many a bitter tear.</p>
<p>
    This is the truth that Job seems to have felt. He says, &quot;You write down 
    bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth&quot; (Job 
    13:26). So also his friend Zophar, speaking of the wicked, says, &quot;The 
    youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust&quot; (Job 
    20:11).</p>
    David also seems to have felt it. He says to the Lord, &quot;Remember not the 
    sins of my youth and my rebellious ways&quot; (Psalm 25:7).</p>
<p>
    Beza, the great Swiss Reformer, felt it so strongly, that he named it in his 
    will as a special mercy that he had been called out from the world, by the 
    grace of God, at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>
    Go and ask believers now, and I think many will tell you much the same. &quot;Oh 
    that I could live my young days over again!&quot; He will most probably say, &quot;Oh 
    that I had spent the beginning of my life in a better way! Oh that I had not 
    laid the foundation of evil habits so strongly in the springtime of my 
    journey!&quot;</p>
<p>
    Young men, I want to save you all this sorrow, if I can. Hell itself is 
    truth known too late. Be wise in time. What youth sows, old age must reap. 
    Do not give the most precious season of your life to that which will not 
    comfort you in the latter days of your life. Sow to yourselves rather in 
    righteousness: break up your hard ground, don't sow among thorns.</p>
<p>
    Sin may be easy for you to do with your hands, or run smoothly off your 
    tongue now, but depend on it, the effects of your sin and you will meet 
    again in time, however little you may like it. Old wounds will often ache 
    and give pain long after they are healed, and only a scar remains: so may 
    you find it with your sins. The footprints of animals have been found on the 
    surface of rocks that were once wet sand, thousands of years after the 
    animal that made them has perished and passed away; so also may it be with 
    your sins.</p>
    &quot;Experience,&quot; says the proverb, &quot;is a <i>hard school</i> to attend, but fools will 
    learn in no other.&quot; I want you all to escape the misery of learning in that 
    school. I want you to avoid the wretchedness that youthful sins are sure to 
    entail. This is the last reason why I exhort you.

 <p align="justify"><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">II. DANGERS OF YOUNG
    MEN</font></b><br>
    <br>
    There are some special dangers that young men need to be warned against.<br>
    <br>
    (1) One danger to young men is PRIDE.<br>
    <br>
    I know well that all souls are in fearful peril. Old or young, it doesn't
    matter; all have a race to run, a battle to fight, a heart to humble, a
    world to overcome, a body to keep under control, a devil to resist; and we
    may very well say, Who is sufficient for these things? But still every age
    and condition has its own peculiar snares and temptations, and it is well to
    know them. He that is forewarned is forearmed. If I can only persuade you to
    be on your guard against the dangers I am going to name, I am sure I shall
    do your souls an essential service.<br>
    <br>
    Pride is the oldest sin in the world. Indeed, it was before the world. Satan
    and his angels fell by pride. They were not satisfied with their first
    situation and status. Thus pride stocked hell with its first inhabitants.<br>
    <br>
    Pride threw Adam out of paradise. He was not content with the place God
    assigned him. He tried to raise himself, and fell. Thus sin, sorrow, and
    death entered in by pride.<br>
    <br>
    Pride sits in all our hearts by nature. We are born proud. Pride makes us
    rest content with ourselves--think we are good enough as we are--keep us
    from taking advice--refuse the gospel of Christ--turn every one to his own
    way. But pride never reigns anywhere so powerfully as in the heart of a
    young man.<br>
    <br>
    How common is it to see young men with big heads, high-minded, and impatient
    of any counsel! How often they are rude and uncourteous to all around them,
    thinking they are not valued and honored as they deserve! How often will
    they not stop to listen to a hint from an older person! They think that they
    know everything. They are full of conceit of their own wisdom. They think
    elderly people, and especially their relatives, are stupid, and dull, and
    slow. They want no teaching or instruction themselves: they understand all
    things. It almost makes them angry to be spoken to. Like young horses, they
    cannot bear the least control. They must be independent and have their own
    way. They seem to think, like those whom Job mentioned, &quot;You are the people,
    and wisdom will die with you&quot; (Job 12:2). And all this is pride.<br>
    <br>
    Rehoboam was such a person, who despised the counsel of the old experienced
    men who stood before his father, and listened to the advice of the young men
    of his own generation. He lived to reap the consequences of his folly. There
    are many like him.<br>
    <br>
    The prodigal son in the parable was also such a person, who needed to have
    his share of the inheritance so he could set himself up in the lifestyle
    that he desired. He could not submit to live quietly under his father's
    roof, but would go into a far country, and be his own master. Like the
    little child that will leave its mother's hand and walk alone, he soon feels
    the sting for his folly. He became wiser when he had to eat husks with the
    swine. But there are many like him.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I beseech you earnestly, beware of pride. Two things are said to
    be very rare sights in the world--one is a young man that is humble, and the
    other is an old man that is content. I fear that this is only too true.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Do not be proud of your own abilities, your own strength, your own
    knowledge, your own appearance, your own cleverness. Do not be proud of
    yourself, and your endowments of any kind. It all comes from not knowing
    yourself and the world. The older you grow, and the more you see, the less
    reason you will find for being proud. Ignorance and inexperience are the
    pedestal of pride; once the pedestal is removed--pride will soon come down.<br>
    <br>
    Remember how often Scripture sets before us the excellence of a humble
    spirit. How strongly we are warned &quot;Do not think of yourself more highly
    than you ought&quot; (Romans 12:3). How plainly we are told, &quot;The man who thinks
    he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know!&quot; (1 Corinthians
    8:2). How strict is the command, &quot;Clothe yourselves with humility&quot;
    (Colossians 3:12). And again, &quot;Clothe yourselves with humility&quot; (1 Peter
    5:5). This is the garment of which many seem not to have so much as a rag.<br>
    <br>
    Think of the great example our Lord Jesus Christ leaves us in this respect.
    He washed the feet of His disciples, saying, &quot;You should do as I have done
    for you&quot; (John 13:15). It is written, &quot;Though he was rich, yet for your
    sakes He became poor&quot; (2 Corinthians 8:9). And again, &quot;He made Himself
    nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.
    And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled himself&quot; (Philippians
    2:7, 8). Surely to be proud is to be more like the devil and fallen Adam,
    than like Christ.<br>
    <br>
    Think of the wisest man that ever lived--I mean Solomon. See how he speaks
    of himself as a &quot;little child,&quot; as one who &quot;does not know how to carry out
    his duties&quot; or manage for himself (1 Kings 3:7). That was a very different
    spirit from his brother Absalom's, who thought himself equal to anything:
    &quot;If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a
    complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice&quot; (2
    Samuel 15:4). That was a very different spirit from his brother Adonijah's,
    who &quot;exalted himself, saying, I will be king&quot; (1 Kings 1:5). Humility was
    the beginning of Solomon's wisdom. He writes it down as his own experience,
    &quot;Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than
    for him&quot; (Proverbs 26:12).<br>
    <br>
    Young men, take to heart the Scriptures just quoted. Do not be too confident
    in your own judgment. Stop being so sure that you are always right, and
    others wrong. Don't trust your own opinion, when you find it contrary to
    that of older men, and especially to that of your own parents. Age gives
    experience, and therefore deserves respect. It is a mark of Elihu's wisdom,
    in the book of Job, that &quot;Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because
    they were older than he&quot; (Job 32:4). And afterwards he said, &quot;I am young in
    years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you
    what I know. I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach
    wisdom&quot; (Job 32:6-7). Humility and silence are beautiful graces in young
    people. Never be ashamed of being a learner: Jesus was one at twelve years;
    when He was found in the temple, He was &quot;sitting among the teachers,
    listening to them and asking them questions&quot; (Luke 2:46). The wisest men
    would tell you they are always learners, and are humbled to find after all
    how little they know. The great Sir Isaac Newton used to say that he felt
    himself no better than a little child, who had picked up a few precious
    stones on the shore of the sea of knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, if you would be wise, if you would be happy, remember the warning
    I give you--Beware of pride.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (2) Another danger to young men is the LOVE OF PLEASURE.<br>
    <br>
    Youth is the time when our passions are strongest--and like unruly children,
    cry most loudly for indulgence. Youth is the time when we have generally our
    most health and strength: death seems far away, and to enjoy ourselves in
    this life seems to be everything. Youth is the time when most people have
    few earthly cares or anxieties to take up their attention. And all these
    things help to make young men think of nothing except pleasure. &quot;I serve
    lusts and pleasures:&quot; that is the true answer many a young man should give,
    if asked, &quot;Whose Servant are you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Young men, time would not permit me to tell you all the fruits this love of
    pleasure produces, and all the ways in which it may do you harm. Why should
    I speak of carousing, partying, drinking, gambling, movie-going, dancing,
    and the like? There are few to be found who don't know something of these
    things by bitter experience. And these are only instances. All things that
    give a feeling of excitement for the time--all things that drown thought,
    and keep the mind in a constant whirl--all things that please the senses and
    delight the flesh--these are the sort of things that have mighty power at
    your time of life, and they owe their power to the love of pleasure. Be on
    your guard. Do not be like those of whom Paul speaks, &quot;Lovers of pleasure
    rather than lovers of God&quot; (2 Timothy 3:4).<br>
    <br>
    Remember what I say: if you would cling to earthly pleasures--these are the
    things which murder souls. There is no surer way to get a seared conscience
    and a hard heart towards the things of God, than to give way to the desires
    of the flesh and mind. It seems like nothing at first, but it tells in the
    long run.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Consider what Peter says: &quot;Abstain from sinful desires, which war against
    your soul&quot; (1 Peter 2:11). They destroy the soul's peace, break down its
    strength, lead it into captivity, and make it a slave.<br>
    <br>
    Consider what Paul says: &quot;Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your
    earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed&quot;
    (Colossians 3:5). &quot;Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the
    sinful nature with its passions and desires&quot; (Galatians 5:24). Once the body
    was a perfect home for a soul--now it is all corrupt and disordered, and
    needs constant watching. It is a burden to the soul--not a helper; a
    hindrance--not an assistance. It may become a useful servant, but it is
    always a bad master.<br>
    <br>
    Consider, again, the words of Paul: &quot;Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus
    Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful
    nature&quot; (Romans 13:14). &quot;These,&quot; says Leighton, &quot;are the words, the very
    reading of which gave Augustine a great conviction of heart, causing an
    immoral young man to be turned into a faithful servant of Jesus Christ.&quot;
    Young men, I wish this might be the case with all of you.<br>
    <br>
    Remember, again, if you cling to earthly pleasures, they will all be
    unsatisfying, empty, and pointless. Like the locusts of the vision in
    Revelation, they seem to have crowns on their heads: but like the same
    locusts, you will find they have stings--real stings--in their tails. All
    that glitters is not gold. All that tastes sweet is not good. All that
    pleases for a while is not real pleasure.<br>
    <br>
    Go and take your fill of earthly pleasures if you will--you will never find
    your heart satisfied with them. There will always be a voice within, crying,
    like the leech in Proverbs 30:15, &quot;Give! Give!&quot; There is an empty place
    there, which nothing but God can fill. You will find, as Solomon did by
    experience, that earthly pleasures are but a meaningless show--promising
    contentment but bringing a dissatisfaction of spirit--gold plated caskets,
    exquisite to look at on the outside, but full of ashes and corruption
    within. Be wise in your youth. Write the word &quot;poison&quot; on all earthly
    pleasures. The most lawful of them must be used in moderation. All of them
    are soul- destroying if you give them your heart. Pleasure, must first have
    the guarantee that it is not sinful--then it is to be enjoyed in moderation.<br>
    <br>
    And I will not shrink from warning all young men to remember the seventh
    commandment; to beware of adultery and sexual immorality, of all impurity of
    every kind. I fear that we don't very often speak on this part of God's law.
    But when I see how prophets and Apostles have dealt with this subject, when
    I observe the open way in which the Reformers of our own Church denounced
    it, when I see the number of young men who walk in the wicked footsteps of
    Reuben, and Hophni, and Phinehas, and Amnon, I for one cannot, with a good
    conscience, hold my peace. The world becomes more wicked because of our
    failure to teach and preach on this commandment. For my own part, I feel it
    would be false and unscriptural delicacy, in addressing men, not to speak of
    that which is preeminently the &quot;young man's sin.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The violation of the seventh commandment is the sin above all others, that,
    as Hosea says, &quot;takes away the understanding&quot; (Hosea 4:11). It is the sin
    that leaves deeper scars upon the soul than any other sin that a man can
    commit. It is a sin that destroys thousands of young men in every age, and
    has even overthrown a few of the saints of God in the past. Samson and David
    are fearful proofs. It is the sin that man dares to smile at, and smoothes
    over using the terms: thrills, love, uncontrollable passions, and natural
    desires. But it is the sin that the devil rejoices over, for he is the
    &quot;unclean spirit;&quot; and it is the sin that God abhors, and declares He &quot;will
    judge&quot; (Hebrews 13:4).<br>
    <br>
    Young men, &quot;Flee from sexual immorality&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:18) if you love
    life. &quot;Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things
    God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient&quot; (Ephesians 5:6). Flee from
    the opportunity of it--from the company of those who might draw you into
    it--from the places where you might be tempted to do it. Read what our Lord
    says about it in Matthew 5:28, &quot;I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman
    lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&quot; Be like the
    holy servant Job: &quot;I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a
    girl&quot; (Job 31:1). Flee from talking about it. It is one of the things that
    ought not even be hinted about in conversation. You cannot even touch black
    grease without getting your hands dirty. Flee from the thoughts of it;
    resist them, destroy them, pray against them--make any sacrifice rather than
    give way to them. Imagination is the hotbed where this sin is too often
    hatched. Guard your thoughts, and there will be little fear about your
    actions.<br>
    <br>
    Consider the caution I have been giving. If you forget everything else, do
    not let this be forgotten.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (3) Another danger to young men is THOUGHTLESSNESS.<br>
    <br>
    Not thinking is one simple reason why thousands of souls are thrown away
    forever into the Lake of Fire. Men will not consider, will not look ahead,
    will not look around them, will not reflect on the end of their present
    course, and the sure consequences of their present days, and wake up to find
    they are damned for a lack of thinking.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, none are in more danger of this than yourselves. You know little
    of the perils around you, and so you are careless how you walk. You hate the
    trouble of serious, quiet thinking, and so you make wrong decisions and
    bring upon yourselves much sorrow. Young Esau had to have his brother's stew
    and sold his birthright: he never thought how much he would want it in the
    future. Young Simeon and Levi had to avenge the rape of their sister Dinah,
    and kill the Shechemites: they never considered how much trouble and anxiety
    they might bring on their father Jacob and his house. Job seems to have been
    especially afraid of this thoughtlessness among his children: it is written,
    that when they had a feast, and the &quot;period of feasting had run its course,
    Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would
    sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, 'Perhaps my children
    have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.' This was Job's regular custom&quot;
    (Job 1:5).<br>
    <br>
    Believe me, this world is not a world in which we can do well without
    thinking, and least of all do well in the matter of our souls. &quot;Don't
    think,&quot; whispers Satan: he knows that an unconverted heart is like a
    dishonest businessman's financial records, they will not bear close
    inspection. &quot;Consider your ways,&quot; says the Word of God--stop and
    think--consider and be wise. The Spanish proverb says it well, &quot;Hurry comes
    from the devil.&quot; Just as men marry in a rush and then are miserable with
    their mate, so they make mistakes about their souls in a minute, and then
    suffer for it for years. Just as a bad servant does wrong, and then says, &quot;I
    never gave it a thought,&quot; so young men run into sin, and then say, &quot;I did
    not think about it--it did not look like sin.&quot; Not look like sin! What would
    you expect? Sin will not come to you, saying, &quot;I am sin;&quot; it would do little
    harm if it did. Sin always seems &quot;good, and pleasant, and desirable,&quot; at the
    time of commission. Oh, get wisdom, get discretion! Remember the words of
    Solomon: &quot;Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm&quot;
    (Proverbs 4:26).<br>
    <br>
    Some, I dare say, will object that I am asking what is unreasonable; that
    youth is not the time of life when people ought to be grave and thoughtful.
    I answer, there is little danger of their being too much so in the present
    day. Foolish talking and kidding, and joking, and excessive amusement, are
    only too common. I don't argue the fact that there is a time for all things;
    but to be always flippant and joking is anything but wise. What does the
    wisest of men say--&quot;It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to
    a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living
    should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad
    face is good for the heart. The heart of the wise is in the house of
    mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure&quot; (Ecclesiastes
    7:2-4). Matthew Henry tells a story of a great statesman in Queen
    Elizabeth's time, who retired from public life in his latter days, and gave
    himself up to serious thought. His former merry companions came to visit
    him, and told him that he was becoming somber: &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I am
    serious; for everyone around me is serious. God is serious in observing
    us--Christ is serious in interceding for us--the Spirit is serious in
    striving with us--the truths of God are serious--our spiritual enemies are
    serious in their endeavors to ruin us--poor lost sinners are serious in
    hell--and why then should you and I not be serious too?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oh, young men, learn to be thoughtful! Learn to consider what you are doing,
    and where you are going. Make time for calm reflection. Commune with your
    own heart, and be still. Remember my caution--Do not be lost merely for the
    lack of thought.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (4) Another danger to young men is CONTEMPT OF CHRISTIANITY.<br>
    <br>
    This also is one of your special dangers. I always observe that none pay so
    little outward respect to Christianity as young men. None take so little
    part in our services, when they are present at them--use Bibles so
    little--sing so little--listen to preaching so little. None are so generally
    absent at prayer meetings, Bible Studies, and all other weekday helps to the
    soul. Young men seem to think they do not need these things--they may be
    good for women and old men, but not for them. They appear ashamed of seeming
    to care about their souls: one would almost fancy they considered it a
    disgrace to go to heaven at all. And this is contempt of Christianity--it is
    the same spirit which made the young people of Bethel mock Elisha--and of
    this spirit I say to all young men, Beware! If it is worthwhile to be a
    Christian, it is worthwhile to be in earnest about it.<br>
    <br>
    Contempt of holy things is the straight road to hell. Once a man begins to
    make a joke of any part of Christianity, then I am never surprised to hear
    that he has turned out to be an unbeliever.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, have you really made up your minds to this? Have you clearly
    looked into the fires which are before you, if you persist in despising
    Christianity? Call to mind the words of David: &quot;The fool says in his heart,
    'There is no God'&quot; (Psalm 14:1). The fool, and no one but the fool has said
    it: but he has never proved it! Remember, if there ever was a book which has
    been proved true from beginning to end, by every kind of evidence, that book
    is the Bible. It has defied the attacks of all enemies and faultfinders.
    &quot;The Word of the Lord is flawless&quot; (Psalm 18:30). It has been tested in
    every way, and the more it has been tested, the more evidently has it been
    shown to be the very handiwork of God Himself. What will you believe, if you
    do not believe the Bible? There is no choice but to believe something
    ridiculous and absurd. Depend on it, no man is so grossly naive as the man
    who denies the Bible to be the Word of God; and if it be the Word of God, be
    careful that you don't despise it.<br>
    <br>
    Men may tell you that there are difficulties in the Bible; things hard to
    understand. It would not be God's book if there were not. And what if there
    are? You don't despise medicines because you cannot explain all that your
    doctor does with them. But whatever men may say, the things needed for
    salvation are as clear as daylight. Be very sure of this--people never
    reject the Bible because they cannot understand it. They understand it too
    well; they understand that it condemns their own behavior; they understand
    that it witnesses against their own sins, and summons them to judgment. They
    try to believe it is false and useless, because they don't like to believe
    it is true. An evil lifestyle must always raise an objection to this book.
    Men question the truth of Christianity because they hate the practice of it.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, when did God ever fail to keep His word? Never. What He has said,
    He has always done; and what He has spoken, He has always made good. Did He
    fail to keep His word at the flood? No. Did He fail with Sodom and Gomorrah?
    No. Did He fail with unbelieving Jerusalem? No. Has He failed with the Jews
    up to this very hour? No. He has never failed to fulfill His word. Take
    care, lest you be found among those who despise God's Word.<br>
    <br>
    Never laugh at Christianity. Never make a joke of sacred things. Never mock
    those who are serious and earnest about their souls. The time may come when
    you will count those happy whom you laughed at--a time when your laughter
    will be turned into sorrow, and your mockery into seriousness.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (5) Another danger to young men is the FEAR OF MAN'S OPINION.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The fear of man&quot; will indeed &quot;prove to be a snare&quot; (Proverbs 29:25). It is
    terrible to observe the power which it has over most minds, and especially
    over the minds of the young. Few seem to have any opinions of their own, or
    to think for themselves. Like dead fish, they go with the stream and tide:
    what others think is right, they think is right; and what others call wrong,
    they call wrong too. There are not many original thinkers in the world. Most
    men are like sheep, they follow a leader. If it was the fashion of the day
    to be Roman Catholics, they would be Roman Catholics, if it was to be
    Islamic, they would be Islamic. They dread the idea of going against the
    current of the times. In a word, the opinion of the day becomes their
    religion, their creed, their Bible, and their God.<br>
    <br>
    The thought, &quot;What will my friends say or think of me?&quot; nips many a good
    inclination in the bud. The fear of being looked at, laughed at, ridiculed,
    prevents many a good habit from being taken up. There are Bibles that would
    be read this very day, if the owners dared. They know they ought to read
    them, but they are afraid: &quot;What will people say?&quot; There are knees that
    would be bent in prayer this very night, but the fear of man forbids it:
    &quot;What would my wife, my brother, my friend, my companion say, if they saw me
    praying?&quot; Oh, what wretched slavery this is, and yet how common! &quot;I was
    afraid of the people and so I gave into them,&quot; Saul said to Samuel, &quot;and so
    he violated the Lord's command&quot; (1 Samuel 15:24). &quot;I am afraid of the Jews,&quot;
    said Zedekiah, the graceless king of Judah: and so he disobeyed the advice
    which Jeremiah gave him (Jeremiah 38:19). Herod was afraid of what his
    guests would think of him: so he did that which made him &quot;greatly
    distressed,&quot; he beheaded John the Baptist. Pilate feared offending the Jews:
    so he did that which he knew in his conscience was unjust--he delivered up
    Jesus to be crucified. If this is not slavery, what is?<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I want you all to be free from this bondage. I want each of you
    to care nothing about man's opinion, when the path of duty is clear. Believe
    me, it is a great thing to be able to say &quot;No!&quot; Here was good King
    Jehoshaphat's weak point--he was too easy and yielding in his dealings with
    Ahab, and therefore caused many of his troubles (1 Kings 22:4). Learn to say
    &quot;No!&quot; Don't let the fear of not seeming good-natured make you unable to do
    it. When sinners entice you, be able to say decidedly, &quot;I will not give in
    to them&quot; (Proverbs 1:10).<br>
    <br>
    Consider how unreasonable this fear of man is. How short lived is man's
    hostility, and how little harm he can do you! &quot;Who are you that you fear
    mortal men, the sons of men, who are but grass, that you forget the LORD
    your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the
    earth?&quot; (Isaiah 51:12-13). And how thankless is this fear! No one will
    really think better of you for it. The world always respects those the most,
    who act boldly for God. Oh, break these bonds, and cast these chains from
    you! Never be ashamed of letting men see that you want to go to heaven. Do
    not think it a disgrace to show that you are a servant of God. Never be
    afraid of doing what is right.<br>
    <br>
    Remember the words of the Lord Jesus: &quot;Do not be afraid of those who kill
    the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can
    destroy both soul and body in hell&quot; (Matthew 10:28). Try only to please God,
    and He will soon make others pleased with you. &quot;When a man's ways are
    pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him&quot;
    (Proverbs 16:7). Young men, be of good courage. Don't worry what the world
    says or thinks: you will not always be with the world. Can man save your
    soul? No. Will man be your judge in the great and dreadful day of judgment?
    No. Can man give you a good conscience in this life, a good hope in death, a
    good answer in the morning of resurrection? No! no! no! Man can do nothing
    of the sort. Then &quot;Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their
    insults. For the moth will eat them up like a garment; the worm will devour
    them like wool&quot; (Isaiah 51:7-8). Call to mind the saying of Gardiner: &quot;I
    fear God, and therefore I have no one else to fear.&quot; Go and be like him.<br>
    <br>
    Such are the warnings I give you. Take them to heart. They are worth
    thinking about. I am greatly mistaken if they are not greatly needed. The
    Lord grant that they have not been given to you in vain.</p>

    <p align="justify"><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">III. GENERAL COUNSELS 
    TO YOUNG MEN<br>
    </font></b><br>
    In the third place, I wish to give some general counsels to young men.<br>
    <br>
    (1) TRY TO GET A CLEAR VIEW OF THE EVIL OF SIN.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, if you did know what sin is, and what sin has done, you would not 
    think it so strange that I exhort you as I do. You do not see it in its true 
    colors. Your eyes are naturally blind to its guilt and danger, and therefore 
    you cannot understand what makes me so worried about you. Oh, don't let the 
    devil succeed in persuading you that sin is a small matter!<br>
    <br>
    Think for a moment what the Bible says about sin; how it dwells naturally in 
    the heart of every man and woman alive (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23), how 
    it defiles our thoughts, words, and actions, and that continually (Genesis 
    6:5; Matthew 15:19), how it renders us all guilty and abominable in the 
    sight of a holy God (Isaiah 64:6; Habakkuk 1:13), how it leaves us utterly 
    without hope of salvation, if we look to ourselves (Psalm 143:2; Romans 
    3:20), how its fruit in this world is shame, and its wages in the world to 
    come--death (Romans 6:21, 23). Think calmly about all this. I tell you this 
    day, it is just as sad to be dying of cancer and not knowing it, as it is to 
    be a living man, and not know it.<br>
    <br>
    Think what an awful change sin has worked on all our natures. Man is no 
    longer what he was when God formed him out of the dust of the ground. He 
    came out of God's hand upright and sinless (Ecclesiastes 7:29). In the day 
    of his creation he was, like everything else, &quot;very good&quot; (Genesis 1:31). 
    And what is man now? A fallen creature, a ruin, a being that shows the marks 
    of corruption all over, his heart like Nebuchadnezzar, degraded and earthly, 
    looking down and not up, his affections like a household in disorder, 
    calling no man master, all extravagance and confusion, his understanding 
    like a lamp flickering in the socket, impotent to guide him, not knowing 
    good from evil, his will like a rudderless ship, tossed to and fro by every 
    desire, and constant only in choosing any way rather than God's. What a 
    wreck man is, compared to what he might have been! We may understand such 
    figures being used as blindness, deafness, disease, sleep, death, when the 
    Spirit has to give us a picture of man as he is. And man as he is, remember, 
    was made so by sin.<br>
    <br>
    Think, too, what it has cost to make atonement for sin, and to provide a 
    pardon and forgiveness for sinners. God's own Son must come into the world, 
    and take upon Him our nature, in order to pay the price of our redemption, 
    and deliver us from the curse of a broken law. He who was in the beginning 
    with the Father, and by whom all things were made, must suffer for sin the 
    just for the unjust--must die the death of a criminal, before the way to 
    heaven can be laid open to any soul. See the Lord Jesus Christ despised and 
    rejected of men, scourged, mocked, and insulted--look at Him bleeding on the 
    cross of Calvary--hear Him crying in agony, &quot;My God, my God, why have you 
    forsaken me?&quot; Note how the sun was darkened, and the rocks shook at the 
    sight; and then consider, young men, what must be the evil and guilt of sin.<br>
    <br>
    Think, also, what sin has already done on the earth. Think how it threw Adam 
    and Eve out of Eden, brought the flood upon the old world, caused fire to 
    come down on Sodom and Gomorrah, drowned Pharaoh and his army in the Red 
    Sea, destroyed the seven wicked nations of Canaan, scattered the twelve 
    tribes of Israel over the face of the earth. Sin alone did all this.<br>
    <br>
    Think, moreover, of all the misery and sorrow that sin has caused, and is 
    causing, to this very day. Pain, disease, death, strifes, quarrels, 
    divisions, envy, jealousy, malice, deceit, fraud, and cheating, violence, 
    oppression, robbery, selfishness, unkindness, and ingratitude; all these are 
    the fruits of sin. Sin is the parent of them all. It is sin that has so 
    marred and spoiled the face of God's creation.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, consider these things, and you will not wonder that we preach as 
    we do. Surely, if you did think of them, you would break with sin forever. 
    Will you play with poison? Will you sport with hell? Will you take fire in 
    your hand? Will you harbor your deadliest enemy in your arms? Will you go on 
    living as if it mattered nothing, whether your sins were forgiven or not, 
    whether sin had dominion over you, or you over sin? Oh, awake to a sense of 
    sin's sinfulness and danger! Remember the words of Solomon: &quot;Fools mock at 
    making amends for sin, but goodwill is found among the upright&quot; (Proverbs 
    14:9).<br>
    <br>
    Hear, then, the request that I make of you this day, pray that God would 
    teach you the real evil of sin. If you would have your soul saved then get 
    up and pray.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (2) SEEK TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.<br>
    <br>
    This is, indeed, the principal thing in Christianity. This is the 
    cornerstone of Christianity. Till you know this, my warnings and advice will 
    be useless, and your endeavors, whatever they may be, will be in vain. A 
    watch that does not keep time is as useless as religion without Christ.<br>
    <br>
    But don't let me be misunderstood. It is not the mere knowing of Christ's 
    name that I mean, it is the knowing of His mercy, grace, and power, the 
    knowing of Him not by the hearing of the ear, but by the experience of your 
    hearts. I want you to know Him by faith, I want you, as Paul says, to know 
    &quot;the power of his resurrection; becoming like Him in His death&quot; (Philippians 
    3:10). I want you to be able to say of Him, He is my peace and my strength, 
    my life and my consolation, my Physician and my Shepherd, my Savior and my 
    God.<br>
    <br>
    Why do I make such a point of this? I do it because in Christ alone &quot;all His 
    [God's] fullness dwells&quot; (Colossians 1:19), because in Him alone there is a 
    full supply of all that we require for the needs of our souls. Of ourselves 
    we are all poor, empty creatures, empty of righteousness and peace, empty of 
    strength and comfort, empty of courage and patience, empty of power to 
    stand, or go on, or make progress in this evil world. It is in Christ alone 
    that all these things are to be found--grace, peace, wisdom, righteousness, 
    sanctification, and redemption. It is just in proportion as we live upon 
    Him, that we are strong Christians. It is only when self is nothing and 
    Christ is all our confidence, it is only then that we shall do great 
    exploits. Only then are we armed for the battle of life, and shall overcome. 
    Only then are we prepared for the journey of life, and shall move forward. 
    To live on Christ, to draw all from Christ, to do all in the strength of 
    Christ, to be ever looking to Christ; this is the true secret of spiritual 
    prosperity. &quot;I can do everything,&quot; says Paul, &quot;through Him who gives me 
    strength&quot; (Philippians 4:13).<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I set before you Jesus Christ this day, as the treasury of your 
    souls; and I invite you to begin by going to Him. Let this be your first 
    step--go to Christ. Do you want to consult friends? He is the best friend: 
    &quot;a friend who sticks closer than a brother&quot; (Proverbs 18:24). Do you feel 
    unworthy because of your sins? Do not fear: His blood cleanses from all sin. 
    He says, &quot;Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; 
    though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool&quot; (Isaiah 1:18). Do 
    you feel weak, and unable to follow Him? Do not fear: He will give you the 
    power to become sons of God. He will give you the Holy Spirit to live in 
    you, and seal you for His own; He will give you a new heart, and He will put 
    a new spirit within you. Are you troubled or beset with a strange bent to 
    evil? Do not fear: there is no evil spirit that Jesus cannot cast out, there 
    is no disease of soul that He cannot heal. Do you feel doubts and fears? 
    Throw them aside: &quot;Come to Me,&quot; He says; &quot;whoever comes to me I will never 
    drive away.&quot; He knows very well the heart of a young man. He knows your 
    trials and your temptations, your difficulties and your foes. In the days of 
    His flesh He was like yours--a young man at Nazareth. He knows by experience 
    a young man's mind. He can understand the feeling of your 
    temptations--because He Himself suffered when He was tempted. Surely you 
    will be without excuse if you turn away from such a Savior and Friend as 
    this.<br>
    <br>
    Hear the request I make of you this day--if you love life, seek to become 
    acquainted with Jesus Christ.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (3) NEVER FORGET THAT NOTHING IS SO IMPORTANT AS YOUR SOUL.<br>
    <br>
    Your soul is eternal. It will live forever. The world and all that it 
    contains will pass away--firm, solid, beautiful, well-ordered as it is, the 
    world will come to an end. &quot;The heavens will disappear with a roar; the 
    elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will 
    be laid bare&quot; (2 Peter 3:10). The works of statesmen, writers, painters, 
    architects, are all short lived: your soul will outlive them all. The 
    angel's voice shall proclaim one day, that &quot;There will be no more delay!&quot; 
    (Revelation 10:6). Try, I beg you, to realize the fact, that your soul is 
    the one thing worth living for. It is the part of you which ought always be 
    considered first. No place, no employment is good for you, which injures 
    your soul. No friend, no companion deserves your confidence, who makes light 
    of your soul's concerns. The man who hurts you, your property, your 
    character, only does you temporary harm. Your true enemy is the one who 
    plots to damage your soul.<br>
    <br>
    Think for a moment why you were born into the world. Not merely to eat and 
    drink, and indulge the desires of the flesh, not merely to dress up your 
    body, and follow its lusts wherever they may lead you, not merely to work, 
    and sleep, and laugh, and talk, and enjoy yourselves, and think of nothing 
    but time. No! you were meant for something higher and better than this. You 
    were placed here to train for eternity. Your body was only intended to be a 
    house for your immortal spirit. It is flying in the face of God's purposes 
    to do as many do--to make the soul a servant to the body, and not the body a 
    servant to the soul.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, God does not show favoritism or respects the honors bestowed by 
    men. He rewards no man's heritage, or wealth, or rank, or position. He does 
    not see with man's eyes. The poorest saint that ever died in a ghetto is 
    nobler in His sight than the richest sinner that ever died in a palace. God 
    does not look at riches, titles, education, beauty, or anything of the kind. 
    There is only one thing that God does look at, and that is the immortal 
    soul. He measures all men by one standard, one measure, one test, one 
    criterion, and that is the state of their souls.<br>
    <br>
    Do not forget this. Keep it in view, morning, noon, and night, the interests 
    of your soul. Rise up each day desiring that your soul may excel, lie down 
    each evening, inquiring of yourself whether you soul has really grown. 
    Remember Zeuxis, the great painter of old. When men asked him why he labored 
    so intensely, and took such extreme pains with every picture, his simple 
    answer was, &quot;I paint for eternity.&quot; Do not be ashamed to be like him. Set 
    your immortal soul before your mind's eye, and when men ask you why you live 
    as you do, answer them in his spirit, &quot;I live for my soul.&quot; Believe me, the 
    day is fast coming when the soul will be the one thing men will think of, 
    and the only question of importance will be this, &quot;Is my soul lost or 
    saved?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (4) REMEMBER IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE A YOUNG MAN AND YET TO SERVE GOD.<br>
    <br>
    I fear the snares that Satan lays for you on this point. I fear that he will 
    succeed in filling your minds with the vain notion, that to be a true 
    Christian as a youth is impossible. I have seen many carried away by this 
    delusion. I have heard it said, &quot;You are requiring an impossibility in 
    expecting so much Christianity from young people. Youth is no time for 
    seriousness. Our desires are strong, and it was never intended that we 
    should keep them under such strong Christian control, as you wish us to do. 
    God meant for us to enjoy ourselves. There will be plenty of time for 
    religion in the future.&quot; And this kind of talk is only too much encouraged 
    by the world. The world is only too ready to wink at youthful sins. The 
    world appears to think it a matter of course that young men must &quot;sow their 
    wild oats.&quot; The world seems to take it for granted that young people must be 
    irreligious, and that it is not possible for them to follow Christ.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I will ask you this simple question--Where will you find anything 
    of this in the Word of God? Where is the chapter or verse in the Bible which 
    will support this talking and reasoning of the world? Doesn't the Bible 
    speak to old and young alike, without distinction? Is not sin--sin, whether 
    committed at the age of twenty or fifty? Will it form the slightest excuse, 
    in the day of judgment, to say, &quot;I know I sinned, but I was young then?&quot; 
    Show your common sense, I beg of you, by giving up such vain excuses. You 
    are responsible and accountable to God from the very moment that you know 
    right and wrong.<br>
    <br>
    I know very well that there are many difficulties in a man's way. But there 
    are always difficulties in the way of doing right. The path to heaven is 
    always narrow, whether we be young or old. There are difficulties, but God 
    will give you the grace to overcome them. God is no hard master. He will 
    not, like Pharaoh, require you to make bricks without straw. He will make 
    sure that the path He requires us to walk is never an impossible road. He 
    never gave commands to man which He would not give man the power to perform.<br>
    <br>
    There are difficulties, but many a young man has overcome them in the past, 
    and so can you. Moses was a young man with passions like yourself; but see 
    what is said of him in Scripture: &quot;By faith Moses, when he had grown up, 
    refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be 
    mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures 
    of sin for a short time. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of 
    greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to 
    his reward&quot; (Hebrews 11:24-26). Daniel was a young man when he began to 
    serve God in Babylon. He was surrounded by temptations of every kind. He had 
    few people with him, and many against him. Yet Daniel's life was so 
    blameless and consistent, that even his enemies could not find any fault in 
    him, except &quot;it has something to do with the law of his God&quot; (Daniel 6:5). 
    And these are not solitary cases. There is a cloud of witnesses whom I could 
    name. Time would not allow me, if I were to tell you of young Isaac, young 
    Joseph, young Joshua, young Samuel, young David, young Solomon, young 
    Abijah, young Obadiah, young Josiah, young Timothy. These were not angels, 
    but men, with natural hearts like your own. They too had obstacles to 
    contend with, lusts to mortify, trials to endure, hard places to travel, 
    like any of you. But young as they were, they all found it possible to serve 
    God. Will they not all rise in judgment and condemn you, if you persist in 
    saying it cannot be done?<br>
    <br>
    Young men, try to serve God. Resist the devil when he whispers it is 
    impossible. Try, and the Lord God of the promises will give you strength in 
    the trying. He loves to meet those who struggle to come to Him, and He will 
    meet you and give you the power that you feel you need. Be like the man whom 
    Bunyan's Pilgrim saw in the Interpreter's house, go forward boldly, saying 
    &quot;Write down my name.&quot; Those words of our Lord are true, though I often hear 
    them repeated by heartless and unfeeling tongues: &quot;Seek and you will find; 
    knock and the door will be opened to you&quot; (Matthew 7:7).<br>
    <br>
    Difficulties which seemed like mountains shall melt away like snow in 
    spring. Obstacles which seemed like giants in the distance, will dwindle 
    into nothing when you actually face them. The lion that blocks the way that 
    you are traveling and causes you great fear, will prove to be chained and 
    unable to harm you. If men believed the promises more, they would never be 
    afraid of their assigned duties. But remember that little word I press upon 
    you, and when Satan says, &quot;You cannot be a Christian while you are young:&quot; 
    answer him, &quot;Get behind me, Satan: by God's help I will try.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (5) DETERMINE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE TO MAKE THE BIBLE YOUR GUIDE AND ADVISER.<br>
    <br>
    The Bible is God's merciful provision for sinful man's soul, the map by 
    which he must steer his course, if he would attain eternal life. All that we 
    need to know, in order to make us peaceful, holy, or happy, is richly 
    contained there. If a young man wants to know how to begin his life well, 
    let him hear what David says: &quot;How can a young man keep his way pure? By 
    living according to your word&quot; (Psalm 119:9).<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I charge you to make a habit of reading the Bible, and not to let 
    the habit be broken. Do not Let the laughter of friends, do not let the bad 
    customs of the family you live in, don't let any of these things prevent 
    your doing it. Determine that you will not only have a Bible, but also make 
    time to read it too. Allow no man to persuade you that it is only a book for 
    Sunday school children and old women. It is the book from which King David 
    got wisdom and understanding. It is the book which young Timothy knew from 
    his childhood. Never be ashamed of reading it. Do not &quot;scorn instruction&quot; 
    (Proverbs 13:13).<br>
    <br>
    Read it with the prayer that the Holy Spirit's grace will help you 
    understand it. It has been said, &quot;A man may just as soon read the Scripture 
    without eyes, as understand the spirit of it without grace.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Read it reverently, as the Word of God, not of man, believing implicitly 
    that what it approves is right, and what it condemns is wrong. Be very sure 
    that every doctrine which will not stand the test of Scripture is false. 
    This will keep you from being tossed to and fro, and carried about by the 
    dangerous opinions of these latter days. Be very sure that every practice in 
    your life which is contrary to Scripture, is sinful and must be given up. 
    This will settle many a question of conscience, and cut the knot of many a 
    doubt. Remember how differently two kings of Judah read the Word of God: 
    Jehoiakim read it, and at once tore the page to pieces, and burned it in the 
    fire (Jeremiah 36:23). And why? Because his heart rebelled against it, and 
    he was resolved not to obey. Josiah read it, and at once tore his clothes, 
    and cried mightily to the Lord (2 Chronicles 34:19). And why? Because his 
    heart was tender and obedient. He was ready to do anything which Scripture 
    showed him was his duty. Oh that you may follow the last of these two, and 
    not the first!<br>
    <br>
    And read it regularly. This is the only way to become &quot;mighty in the 
    Scriptures.&quot; A quick glance at the Bible now and then does little good. At 
    that rate you will never become familiar with its treasures, or feel the 
    sword of the Spirit fitted to your hand in the hour of conflict. But store 
    up your mind with Scripture, by diligent reading, and you will soon discover 
    its value and power. Texts will rise up in your hearts in the moment of 
    temptation. Commands will suggest themselves in times of doubt. Promises 
    will come across your thoughts in the time of discouragement. And thus you 
    will experience the truth of David's words, &quot;I have hidden your word in my 
    heart that I might not sin against you&quot; (Psalm 119:11); and of Solomon's 
    words, &quot;When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch 
    over you; when you awake, they will speak to you&quot; (Proverbs 6:22).<br>
    <br>
    I dwell on these things more because this is an age of reading. There seems 
    no end to the producing of many books, though few of them are really 
    profitable. There seems a rage for cheap printing and publishing. Newspapers 
    of every sort abound, and the tone of some, which have the widest 
    circulation, speaks badly for the taste of the age. Amid the flood of 
    dangerous reading, I plead for my Master's book, I call upon you not to 
    forget the book of the soul. Do not let newspapers, novels, and romances be 
    read, while the prophets and Apostles be despised. Do not let the exciting 
    and sensual swallow up your attention, while the edifying and the 
    sanctifying can find no place in your mind.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, give the Bible the honor due to it every day you live. Whatever 
    you read, read that first. And beware of bad books: there are plenty in this 
    day. Take heed what you read. I suspect there is more harm done to souls in 
    this way than most people have an idea is possible. Value all books in 
    proportion as they are agreeable to Scripture. Those that are nearest to it 
    are the best, and those that are farthest from it, and most contrary to it, 
    the worst. (6) Never make an intimate friend of anyone who is not a friend 
    of God.<br>
    <br>
    Understand me, I do not speak of acquaintances. I do not mean that you ought 
    to have nothing to do with anyone but true Christians. To take such a line 
    is neither possible nor desirable in this world. Christianity requires no 
    man to be discourteous.<br>
    <br>
    But I do advise you to be very careful in your choice of friends. Do not 
    open all your heart to a man merely because he is clever, agreeable, 
    good-natured, and kind. These things are all very well in their way, but 
    they are not everything. Never be satisfied with the friendship of any one 
    who will not be useful to your soul.<br>
    <br>
    Believe me, the importance of this advice cannot be overrated. There is no 
    telling the harm that is done by associating with godless companions and 
    friends. The devil has few better helps in ruining a man's soul. Grant him 
    this help, and he cares little for all the armor with which you may be armed 
    against him. Good education, early habits of morality, sermons, books, all, 
    he knows well, will avail you little, if you will only cling to ungodly 
    friends. You may resist many open temptations, refuse many plain snares; but 
    once you take up a bad companion, and he is content. That awful chapter 
    which describes Amnon's wicked conduct about Tamar, almost begins with these 
    words, &quot;Now Amnon had a friend, a very shrewd man&quot; (2 Samuel 13:3).<br>
    <br>
    You must remember, we are all creatures of imitation: precept may teach us, 
    but it is example that draws us. There is that in us all, that we are always 
    disposed to catch the ways of those with whom we live; and the more we like 
    them, the stronger does the disposition grow. Without our being aware of it, 
    they influence our tastes and opinions; we gradually give up what they 
    dislike, and take up what they like, in order to become closer friends with 
    them. And, worst of all, we catch their ways in things that are wrong far 
    quicker than in things that are right. Health, unhappily, is not contagious, 
    but disease is. It is far more easy to catch a chill than to impart a 
    warmth; and to make each other's religion dwindle away, than grow and 
    prosper.<br>
    <br>
    Young men, I ask you to take these things to heart. Before you let any one 
    become your constant companion, before you get into the habit of telling him 
    everything, and going to him with all your troubles and all your 
    pleasures--before you do this, just think of what I have been saying; ask 
    yourself, &quot;Will this be a useful friendship to me or not?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Bad company&quot; does indeed &quot;corrupt good character&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:33). I 
    wish that text were written in the hearts of all young men. Good friends are 
    among our greatest blessings; they may keep us away from much evil, remind 
    us of our course, speak an appropriate word at the right time, draw us 
    upward, and draw us on. But a bad friend is a burden, a weight continually 
    dragging, us down, and chaining us to earth. Keep company with an unsaved 
    man, and it is more than probable you will in the end become like him. that 
    is the general consequence of all such friendships. The good go down to the 
    bad, and the bad do not come up to the good. The world's proverb is only too 
    correct: &quot;Clothes and company tell true tales about character.&quot; &quot;Show me who 
    a man lives with and I will show you what he is.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I dwell upon this point, because it has more to do with your prospects in 
    life than first appears. If you ever marry, it is more than probable you 
    will choose a wife from among your circle of friends or their acquaintances. 
    If Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram had not formed a friendship with Ahab's family, 
    he would most likely not have married Ahab's daughter. And who can estimate 
    the importance of a right choice in marriage? It is a step which, according, 
    to the old saying, &quot;either makes a man or ruins him.&quot; Your happiness in both 
    lives may depend on it. Your wife must either help your soul or harm it. She 
    will either fan the flame of Christianity in your heart, or throw cold water 
    upon it, and make it burn low. She will either be, wings or handcuffs, an 
    encouragement or an hindrance to your Christianity, according to her 
    character. He that finds a good wife does indeed &quot;finds a good thing;&quot; so if 
    you have the desire to find one, be very careful how you choose your 
    friends.<br>
    <br>
    Do you ask me what kind of friends you should choose? Choose friends who 
    will benefit your soul, friends whom you can really respect, friends whom 
    you would like to have near you on your deathbed, friends who love the 
    Bible, and are not afraid to speak to you about it, friends that you would 
    not be ashamed of having at the coming of Christ, and the day of judgment. 
    Follow the example that David sets for you: he says, &quot;I am a friend to all 
    who fear you, to all who follow your precepts&quot; (Psalm 119:63). Remember the 
    words of Solomon: &quot;He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of 
    fools suffers harm&quot; (Proverbs 13:20). But depend on it, bad company in this 
    life, is the sure way to procure worse company in the life to come.</p>

<h1>IV. SPECIAL RULES FOR  YOUNG MEN</h1>

    In the last place, I will set down some particular rules of conduct which I 

    strongly advise all young men to follow.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    (1) RESOLVE AT ONCE, BY GOD'S HELP, TO BREAK OFF EVERY KNOWN SIN, HOWEVER 

    SMALL.<br>

    <br>

    Look within, each one of you. Examine your own hearts. Do you see there any 

    habit or custom which you know is wrong in the sight of God? If you do, 

    don't delay for a moment in attacking it. Resolve at once to lay it aside. 

    Nothing, darkens the eyes of the mind so much, and deadens the conscience so 

    surely, as an allowed sin. It may be a little one, but it is not any less 

    dangerous. A small leak will sink a great ship, and a small spark will 

    kindle a great fire, and a little allowed sin in like manner will ruin an 

    immortal soul. Take my advice, and never spare a little sin. Israel was 

    commanded to kill every Canaanite, both great and small. Act on the same 

    principle, and show no mercy to little sins. Well says the book of the Song 

    of Songs, &quot;Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards&quot; 

    (Song of Songs 2:15).<br>

    <br>

    You can be sure that no wicked man ever meant to be so wicked at his first 

    beginnings. But he began with allowing himself some little sins, and that 

    led on to something greater, and that in time produced something greater 

    still, and thus he became the miserable being that he now is. When Hazael 

    heard from Elisha of the horrible acts that he would one day do, he said 

    with astonishment, &quot;How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a 

    feat?&quot; (2 Kings 8:13). But he allowed sin to take root in his heart, and in 

    the end he did them all.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, resist sin in its beginnings. They may look small and 

    insignificant, but mind what I say, resist them, make no compromise, let no 

    sin lodge quietly and undisturbed in your heart. There is nothing finer than 

    the point of a needle, but when it has made a hole, it draws all the thread 

    after it. Remember the Apostle's words, &quot;A little yeast works through the 

    whole batch of dough&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:6).<br>

    <br>

    Many a young man could tell you with sorrow and shame, that he traces the 

    ruin of all his worldly prospects to the point I speak of--to giving way to 

    sin in its beginnings. He began habits of deception and dishonesty in little 

    things, and they grew on him. Step by step, he has gone on from bad to 

    worse, till he has done things that at one time he would have thought 

    impossible till at last he has lost his standing, lost his character, lost 

    his peace, and almost lost his soul. He allowed a gap in the wall of his 

    conscience, because it seemed a little one, and once allowed, that gap grew 

    larger every day, till in time the whole wall seemed to come down.<br>

    <br>

    Remember this especially in matters of truth and honesty. Be careful in even 

    the least syllable spoken. &quot;Whoever can be trusted with very little can also 

    be trusted with much&quot; (Luke 16:10). Whatever the world may like to think, 

    there are no little sins. All great buildings are made up of little 

    parts--the first stone is as important as any other. All habits are formed 

    by a succession of little acts, and the first little act is of mighty 

    consequence. The axe in the fable only begged the trees to let him have one 

    little piece of wood to make a handle, and he would never trouble them any 

    more. He got it, and then he soon cut them all down. The devil only wants to 

    get the wedge of a little allowed sin into your heart, and you will soon be 

    all his own. It is a wise saying, &quot;There is nothing small between us and 

    God, for God is an infinite God.&quot;<br>

    <br>

    There are two ways of coming down from the top of a ladder; one is to jump 

    down, and the other is to come down by the steps: but both will lead you to 

    the bottom. So also there are two ways of going to hell; one is to walk into 

    it with your eyes open--few people do that; the other is to go down by the 

    steps of little sins--and that way, I fear, is only too common. Put up with 

    a few little sins, and you will soon want a few more. Even a heathen could 

    say, &quot;Who was ever content with only one sin?&quot; If you put up with little 

    sins then your path in life will be worse and worse every year. Jeremy 

    Taylor very clearly described the progress of sin in a man:<br>

    <br>

    First it startles him, then it becomes pleasing, then easy, then delightful, 

    then frequent, then habitual, then a way of life! Then the man feels no 

    guilt, then obstinate, then resolves never to repent, and then he is damned.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, if you don't want to come to this, remember the rule I give you 

    this day--resolve at once to break off every known sin.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    (2) RESOLVE, BY GOD'S HELP, TO SHUN EVERYTHING WHICH MAY PROVE AN OCCASION 

    OF SIN.<br>

    <br>

    It is an excellent saying, &quot;He that would be safe from the acts of evil, 

    must widely avoid the occasions.&quot; There is an old fable, that the butterfly 

    once asked the owl how she should deal with the fire, which had singed her 

    wings; and the owl counseled her, in reply, not to even look at its smoke. 

    It is not enough that we determine not to commit sin, we must carefully keep 

    at a distance from all approaches to it. By this test we ought to examine 

    the ways we spend our time--the books that we read, the friends that we 

    visit, the part of society which we interact with. We must not be content 

    with saying, &quot;There is nothing wrong here;&quot; we must go further, and say, &quot;Is 

    there anything here which may cause me to sin?&quot;<br>

    <br>

    This is one great reason why idleness is to be avoided. It is not that doing 

    nothing is of itself so wicked; it is the opportunity it affords to evil and 

    empty thoughts; it is the wide door it opens for Satan to throw in the seeds 

    of bad things; it is this which is mainly to be feared. If David had not 

    given opportunity to the devil, by walking on his house-top in Jerusalem 

    with nothing to do, he probably never would have seen Bathsheba bathing, nor 

    murdered her husband Uriah.<br>

    <br>

    This, too, is one good reason why worldly entertainments are so 

    objectionable. It may be difficult, in some instances, to show that they 

    are, in themselves, positively unscriptural and wrong. But there is little 

    difficulty in showing that the tendency of almost all of them is most 

    injurious to the soul. They sow the seeds of an earthly and sensual frame of 

    mind. They war against the life of faith. They promote an unhealthy and 

    unnatural craving after excitement. They minister to the lust of the flesh, 

    and the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. They dim the view of heaven 

    and eternity, and give a false color to the things of time. They take away 

    time for private prayer, and Scripture reading, and calm communion with God. 

    The man who mingles in them is like one who gives Satan an advantage. He has 

    a battle to fight, and he gives his enemy the help of sun, and wind, and 

    hill. It would indeed be strange if he did not find himself continually 

    overcome.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, endeavor, as much as you can, to keep clear of everything which 

    may prove injurious to your soul. People may say you are too conscientious, 

    too particular, and ask where is the great harm of such and such things? But 

    don't listen to them. It is dangerous to play tricks with sharp tools: it is 

    far more dangerous to take liberties with your immortal soul. He that would 

    be safe must not come near the brink of danger. He must look on his heart as 

    a barrel of gunpowder, and be cautious not to handle one spark of temptation 

    more than he can help.<br>

    <br>

    What is the use of your praying, &quot;Lord keep me from temptation,&quot; unless you 

    are careful not to run into it and &quot;keep me from evil,&quot; unless you show a 

    desire to keep out of its way? Take an example from Joseph--Not merely did 

    he refuse solicitation to sin from his master's wife, but he showed his 

    prudence in refusing to even be &quot;with her&quot; (Genesis 39:10). Take to heart 

    the advice of Solomon, not only to &quot;Not set foot on the path of the wicked,&quot; 

    but to &quot;Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go your way&quot; 

    (Proverbs 4:15); &quot;Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in 

    the cup, when it goes down smoothly!&quot; (Proverbs 23:31). The man who took the 

    vow of a Nazarite in Israel, not only took no wine, but be even abstained 

    from grapes in any shape whatever. &quot;Hate what is evil,&quot; says Paul to the 

    Romans (Romans 12:9); not merely not to do it; &quot;Flee the evil desires of 

    youth,&quot; he writes to Timothy; get away from them as far as possible (2 

    Timothy 2:22). Oh, how needful are such cautions! Dinah just had go out 

    among the wicked Shechemites, to see their ways, and she lost her virginity. 

    Lot just had pitched his tent near sinful Sodom, and he lost everything but 

    his life.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, be wise with your time. Do not always be trying to see how near 

    you can allow the enemy of souls to come, and yet escape him. Hold him at 

    arm's length. Try to keep clear of temptation as far as possible, and this 

    will be one great help to keep clear of sin.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    (3) RESOLVE NEVER TO FORGET THE EYE OF GOD.<br>

    <br>

    The eye of God! Think of that. Everywhere, in every house, in every field, 

    in every room, in every company, alone or in a crowd, the eye of God is 

    always on you. &quot;The eyes of the Lord are everywhere, keeping watch on the 

    wicked and the good&quot; (Proverbs 15:3), and they are eyes that read hearts as 

    well as actions.<br>

    <br>

    Endeavor, I beg you, to realize this fact. Remember that you have to deal 

    with an all-seeing God, a God who never sleeps, a God who understands your 

    thoughts, and with whom the night shines as the day. You may leave your 

    father's house, and go away, like the prodigal, into a far country, and 

    think that there is nobody to watch your conduct; but the eye and ear of God 

    are there before you. You may deceive your parents or employers, you may 

    tell them lies, and act one way before their faces, and another behind their 

    backs, but you cannot deceive God. He knows you through and through. He 

    heard what you said as you came here today. He knows what you are thinking 

    of at this minute. He has set your most secret sins in the light of His 

    countenance, and they will one day come out before the world to your shame, 

    except you take heed.<br>

    <br>

    How little is this really felt! How many things are done continually, which 

    men would never do if they thought they were seen! How many matters are 

    transacted in the rooms of imagination, which would never bear the light of 

    day! Yes; men entertain thoughts in private, and say words in private, and 

    do acts in private, which they would be ashamed and blush to have exposed 

    before the world. The sound of a footstep coming has stopped many a deed of 

    wickedness. A knock at the door has caused many an evil work to be hastily 

    suspended, and hurriedly laid aside. But oh, what miserable folly is all 

    this! There is an all-seeing Witness with us wherever we go. Lock the door, 

    pull down the blind, turn out the light; it doesn't matter, it makes no 

    difference; God is everywhere, you cannot shut Him out, or prevent His 

    seeing. &quot;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is 

    uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account&quot; 

    (Hebrews 4:13). Young Joseph understood this well when his employer's wife 

    tempted him. There was no one in the house to see them, no human eye to 

    witness against him; but Joseph was one who lived as seeing Him that is 

    invisible: &quot;How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?&quot; 

    (Genesis 39:9)<br>

    <br>

    Young men, I ask all of you to read Psalm 139. I advise all of you to learn 

    it by heart. Make it the test of all your dealings in this world's business: 

    say to yourself often, &quot;Do I remember that God sees me?&quot;<br>

    <br>

    Live as in the sight of God. This is what Abraham did, he walked before Him. 

    This is what Enoch did, he walked with Him. This is what heaven itself will 

    be, the eternal presence of God. Do nothing that you would not like God to 

    see. Say nothing, you would not like God to hear. Write nothing, you would 

    not like God to read. Go no place where you would not like God to find you. 

    Read no book of which you would not like God to say, &quot;Show it to Me.&quot; Never 

    spend your time in such a way that you would not like to have God say, &quot;What 

    are you doing?&quot;<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    (4) BE DILIGENT IN THE PRACTICE OF YOUR CHRISTIANITY.<br>

    <br>

    Be regular in going to church, whenever it is open for prayer and preaching, 

    and it is in your power to attend. Be regular in keeping, the Lord's day 

    holy, and determine that God's day out of the seven shall always be given to 

    its rightful owner.<br>

    <br>

    I would not want to leave any false impression on your minds. Do not go away 

    and say I told you that going to church made up the whole of Christianity. I 

    will tell you no such thing. I have no wish to see you grow up formalists 

    and Pharisees. If you think the mere carrying of your body to a certain 

    building, at certain times, on a certain day in the week, will make you a 

    Christian, and prepare you to meet God, I tell you flatly you are miserably 

    deceived. All services without heart-service are unprofitable and vain. They 

    only are true worshipers who &quot;Worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for 

    they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks&quot; (John 4:23).<br>

    <br>

    But the practices of Christianity are not to be despised because they are 

    not saviors. Gold is not food, you cannot eat it, but you would not say it 

    is useless, and throw it away. Your soul's eternal wellbeing most certainly 

    does not depend on the practices of Christianity, but it is certain that 

    without them, as a general rule, your soul will not do well. God might take 

    all who are saved to heaven in a chariot of fire, as He did Elijah, but He 

    does not do so. He might teach them all by visions, and dreams, and 

    miraculous interventions, without requiring them to read or think for 

    themselves, but He does not do so. And why not? Because He is a God that 

    works by means, and it is His law and will that in all man's dealings with 

    Him means shall be used. No one but a fool would think of building a house 

    without ladders and scaffolding, and just so no wise man will despise means.<br>

    <br>

    I dwell on this point, because Satan will try hard to fill your minds with 

    arguments against the practices of Christianity. He will draw your attention 

    to the numbers of persons who use them and are no better for the using. &quot;See 

    there,&quot; he will whisper, &quot;do you not observe that those who go to church are 

    no better than those who stay away?&quot; But do not let this move you. It is 

    never fair to argue against a thing because it is improperly used. It does 

    not follow that the practices of Christianity can do no good because many do 

    them and get no good from them. Medicine is not to be despised because many 

    take it and do not recover their health. No man would think of giving up 

    eating, and drinking because others choose to eat and drink improperly, and 

    so make themselves sick. The value of the practices of Christianity, like 

    other things, depends, in a great measure, on the manner and spirit in which 

    we use them.<br>

    <br>

    I dwell on this point too, because of the strong anxiety I feel that every 

    young man should regularly hear the preaching of Christ's gospel. I cannot 

    tell you how important I think this is. By God's blessing, the ministry of 

    the gospel might be the means of converting, your soul, of leading you to a 

    saving knowledge of Christ, of making you a child of God in action and in 

    truth. This would indeed be cause for eternal thankfulness. This would be an 

    event over which angels would rejoice. But even if this were not the case, 

    there is a restraining power and influence in the ministry of the gospel, 

    under which I earnestly desire every young man to be brought. There are 

    thousands whom it keeps back from evil, though it has not yet turned them to 

    God--it has made them far better members of society--though it has not yet 

    made them true Christians. There is a certain kind of mysterious power in 

    the faithful preaching of the gospel, which has an effect on multitudes who 

    listen to it without receiving it into their hearts. To hear sin exposed for 

    what it is, and holiness lifted up, to hear Christ exalted, and the words of 

    the devil denounced--to hear the kingdom of heaven and its blessedness 

    described, and the world and its emptiness exposed; to hear this week after 

    week, Sunday after Sunday, is seldom without a good effect to the soul. It 

    makes it far harder afterwards to run out and commit gross sins. It acts as 

    a wholesome check upon a man's heart. This, I believe, is one way in which 

    that promise of God is made good, &quot;My word that goes out from my mouth: it 

    will not return to me empty&quot; (Isaiah 55:11). There is so much truth in that 

    strong saying of Whitefield, &quot;The gospel keeps many a person from going to 

    jail and from being hanged, if it does not keep him from hell.&quot;<br>

    <br>

    Let me name another point which is closely connected with this subject. Let 

    nothing ever tempt you to become a Christian who does not make every effort 

    to attend church on Sunday and make the day special to the Lord. Make up 

    your mind to give all your Sundays to God. A spirit of disregard for this 

    day is growing up among us with fearful rapidity, and not least among young 

    men. Sunday vacations, Sunday visiting, Sunday excursions, to the exclusion 

    of church attendance and honoring of the Lord, are becoming more common 

    every year than they were, and are doing infinite harm to souls.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, be jealous on this point. Whether you live in the city or in the 

    country, take up a decided line; resolve not to miss church on Sunday and 

    the fellowship of God's people. Do not let the plausible argument of 

    &quot;needing to sleep-in to rest your body,&quot; do not let not the example of all 

    those around you, do not let the invitation of companions pull you away from 

    fellowship and worship; let none of these things move you to depart from 

    this settled rule, that Sunday's are for God's honor and for fellowship with 

    His people.<br>

    <br>

    Once you don't consider Sundays important or anything special in your 

    Christian life, then in the end you will give up caring for your soul. The 

    steps which lead to this conclusion are easy and common. Begin with not 

    honoring the Lord's Day, and you will soon not honor God's people; cease to 

    honor God's book; and in time you will give God no honor at all. Let a man 

    lay the foundation of having no respect for God's worship or the fellowship 

    of the saints, and I am never surprised if he finishes with no God. It is a 

    remarkable saying of Judge Hale, &quot;Of all the persons who were convicted of 

    capital crimes while he was on the bench, he found only a few who would not 

    confess, on inquiry, that they began their career of wickedness by a neglect 

    of the church and God's people.&quot;<br>

    <br>

    Young men, you may have friends who forget the honor of the Lord's day; but 

    resolve, by God's help, that you will always remember to keep it special. 

    Honor it by a regular attendance at some place where the gospel is preached. 

    Settle down under a faithful ministry, and once settled, let your place in 

    church never be empty. Believe me, you will find a special blessing 

    following you: &quot;If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from 

    doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and 

    the LORD'S holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way 

    and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, then you will find your 

    joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and 

    to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob&quot; (Isaiah 58:13-14). And one 

    thing is very certain, your feelings about Sunday and the fellowship will 

    always be a test and criterion of your fitness for heaven. Fellowship and 

    worship are a foretaste and a fragment of heaven. The man who finds them a 

    burden and not a privilege, may be sure that his heart stands in need of a 

    mighty change.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    (5) RESOLVE THAT WHEREVER YOU ARE, YOU WILL PRAY.<br>

    <br>

    Prayer is the life-breath of a man's soul. Without it, we may have a name to 

    live, and be counted Christians; but we are dead in the sight of God. The 

    feeling that we must cry to God for mercy and peace is a mark of salvation; 

    and the habit of spreading before Him our soul's needs is an evidence that 

    we have the spirit of adoption. And prayer is the appointed way to obtain 

    the relief of our spiritual necessities. It opens the treasury, and sets the 

    fountain flowing. If we don't have, it is because we don't ask.<br>

    <br>

    Prayer is the way to procure the outpouring of the Spirit upon our hearts. 

    Jesus has promised the Holy Spirit, the Comforter. He is ready to come down 

    with all His precious gifts, renewing, sanctifying, purifying, 

    strengthening, cheering, encouraging, enlightening, teaching, directing, 

    guiding, into all truth. But then He waits to be asked.<br>

    <br>

    And here it is, I say it with sorrow, here it is that men fall short so 

    miserably. Few indeed are to be found who pray: there are many who go down 

    on their knees, and say a form perhaps, but few who pray; few who cry out to 

    God, few who call on the Lord, few who seek as if they wanted to find, few 

    who knock as if they hungered and thirsted, few who wrestle, few who strive 

    with God earnestly for an answer, few who give Him no rest, few who continue 

    in prayer, few who pray always without ceasing and do not grow weak. Yes: 

    few pray! It is just one of the things assumed as a matter of course, but 

    seldom practiced; a thing which is everybody's business, but in fact hardly 

    anybody performs.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, believe me, if your soul is to be saved, you must pray. God has 

    no speechless children. If you are to resist the world, the flesh, and the 

    devil, you must pray: it is in vain to look for strength in the hour of 

    trial, if it has not been sought for. You may be thrown in with those who 

    never do it, you may have to sleep in the same room with someone who never 

    asks anything of God, still, mark my words, you must pray.<br>

    <br>

    I can believe that you find it difficult to do, difficulties about 

    opportunities to pray, and times to pray, and places to pray. I dare not lay 

    down too strict rules on such points as these. I leave them to your own 

    conscience. You must be guided by circumstances. Our Lord Jesus Christ 

    prayed on a mountain; Isaac prayed in the fields; Hezekiah turned his face 

    to the wall as he lay upon his bed; Daniel prayed by the riverside; Peter, 

    the Apostle, on the housetop. I have heard of young men praying in stables 

    and haylofts. All that I contend for is this, you must know what it is to 

    &quot;go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen&quot; 

    (Matthew 6:6). There must be stated times when you must speak to God face to 

    face, you must every day have your times for prayer--You must pray.<br>

    <br>

    Without this, all my advice and counsel is useless. This is that piece of 

    spiritual armor which Paul names last in his list, in Ephesians 6, but it is 

    in truth that is first in value and importance. This is that meat which you 

    must eat daily, if you would travel safely through the wilderness of this 

    life. It is only in the strength of this that you will get onward towards 

    the mountain of God. I have heard it said that some people who grind metal 

    sometimes wear a magnetic mouthpiece at their work, which catches all the 

    fine metal dust that flies around them, prevents it from entering their 

    lungs, and so saves their lives. Prayer is the mouthpiece that you must wear 

    continually, or else you will never work uninjured by the unhealthy 

    atmosphere of this sinful world. You must pray.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, be sure no time is so well spent as that which a man spends on 

    his knees. Make time for this, whatever your situation may be. Think of 

    David, King of Israel: what does be say? &quot;Evening, morning and noon I cry 

    out in distress, and he hears my voice&quot; (Psalm 55:17). Think of Daniel. He 

    had all the business of a kingdom on his hands; yet he prayed three times a 

    day. See there the secret of his safety in wicked Babylon. Think of Solomon. 

    He begins his reign with prayer for help and assistance, and hence his 

    wonderful prosperity. Think of Nehemiah. He could find time to pray to the 

    God of heaven, even when standing in the presence of his master, Artaxerxes. 

    Think of the example these good men have left you, and go and do likewise.<br>

    <br>

    Oh that the Lord may give you all the spirit of grace and supplication! 

    &quot;Have you not just called to me: 'My Father, my friend from my youth'&quot; 

    (Jeremiah 3:4). Gladly would I consent to the fact that all of this message 

    should be forgotten, if only this doctrine of the importance of prayer might 

    be impressed on your hearts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p align="justify"><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">V. CONCLUSION<br>

    </font></b><br>

    And now I hurry towards a conclusion. I have said things that many perhaps 

    will not like, and not receive; but I appeal to your consciences, Are they 

    not true?<br>

    <br>

    Young men, you all have consciences. Corrupt and ruined by the fall as we 

    are, each of us has a conscience. In a corner of each heart there sits a 

    witness for God, a witness who condemns when we do wrong, and approves when 

    we do right. To that witness I make my appeal this day, are not the things 

    that I have been saying true?<br>

    <br>

    Go then, young men, and resolve this day to remember your Creator in the 

    days of your youth. Before the day of grace is past, before your conscience 

    has become hardened by age, and deadened by repeated trampling under foot, 

    while you have strength, and time, and opportunities, go and join yourself 

    to the Lord in an everlasting covenant not to be forgotten. The Spirit will 

    not always strive. The voice of conscience will become feebler and fainter 

    every year you continue to resist it. The Athenians said to Paul, &quot;We want 

    to hear you again on this subject&quot; but they had heard him for the last time 

    (Acts 17:32). Make haste, and don't delay. Linger and hesitate no more.<br>

    <br>

    Think of the unspeakable comfort you will give to parents, relatives, and 

    friends, if you take my counsel. They have expended time, money, and health 

    to raise you, and make you what you are. Surely they deserve some 

    consideration. Who can know the joy and gladness which young people have in 

    their power to give? Who can tell the anxiety and sorrow that sons like 

    Esau, and Hophni, and Phinehas, and Absalom may cause? Truly indeed does 

    Solomon say, &quot;A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son grief 

    to his mother&quot; (Proverbs 10:1). Oh, consider these things, and give God your 

    heart! Let it not be said of you at last, as it is of many, that your &quot;youth 

    was a disorder, your manhood a struggle, and your old age a regret.&quot;<br>

    <br>

    Think of the good you might be doing for the world. Almost all the eminent 

    saints of God sought the Lord early. Moses, Samuel, David, Daniel, all 

    served God from their youth. God seems to delight in putting special honor 

    upon young servants; and think of what we could expect, if young men in our 

    own day would consecrate the springtime of their lives to God? Workers are 

    wanted now in almost every great and good cause, and cannot be found. 

    Technology of every kind for spreading truth exists, but there are not 

    people to make it work.<br>

    <br>

    Money is more easily obtained for doing good than men. Ministers are wanted 

    for new churches, missionaries are wanted for new fields, teachers are 

    wanted for Sunday School, many a good cause is standing still merely for 

    want of workers. The supply of godly, faithful, trustworthy men, for posts 

    like those I have named, is far below the demand.<br>

    <br>

    Young men of the present day, you are wanted for God. This is an age of 

    activity. We are shaking off some of our past selfishness. Men no longer 

    sleep the sleep of apathy and indifference about others, as their 

    forefathers did. They are beginning to be ashamed of thinking like Cain, &quot;Am 

    I my brother's keeper?&quot; A wide field of usefulness is open before you, if 

    you are only willing to enter into it. The harvest is great, and the workers 

    are few. Be zealous of good works. Come, come to the aid of the Lord against 

    the wickedness of this age.<br>

    <br>

    This is, in some sort, to be like God, not only good, but doing good (Psalm 

    119:68). This is the way to follow the steps of your Lord and Savior: &quot;He 

    went around doing good&quot; (Acts 10:38).<br>

    <br>

    And who can doubt that this is the path which makes an immortal soul 

    beautiful? Who would not rather leave this world like Josiah, grieved by 

    all, than depart like Jehoram, &quot;to no one's regret?&quot; (2 Chronicles 21:20). 

    Is it better to be idle, frivolous, to live for your body, your selfishness, 

    your lusts, and your pride, or to spend and be spent in the glorious cause 

    of usefulness to your fellow men--to be a blessing to your country and the 

    world, to be the friend of the prisoner and the captive, to be the spiritual 

    father of hundreds of immortal souls in heathen lands, to be a burning and a 

    shining light, an epistle of Christ, known and read of all men, the 

    inspiration of every Christian heart that comes across your path? Oh, who 

    can doubt? Who can for one moment doubt?<br>

    <br>

    Young men, consider your responsibilities. Think of the privilege and luxury 

    of doing good. Resolve this day to be useful. Give your hearts at once to 

    Christ.<br>

    <br>

    Think, lastly, of the happiness that will come to your own soul, if you 

    serve God, happiness as you travel through life, and happiness in the end, 

    when the journey is over. Believe me, whatever vain notions you may have 

    heard, believe me, there is a reward for the righteous even in this world. 

    Godliness has indeed the promise of this life, as well as of that which is 

    to come. There is a solid peace in feeling that God is your friend. There is 

    a real satisfaction in knowing that however your unworthiness, you are 

    complete in Christ, that you have an enduring portion, that you have chosen 

    that good part which shall not be taken from you.<br>

    <br>

    The backslider in heart may well be content with his own ways, but &quot;the good 

    man [will be] rewarded for his&quot; (Proverbs 14:14). The path of the worldly 

    man grows darker and darker every year that he lives; the path of the 

    Christian is like a shining light, brighter and brighter to the very end. 

    His sun is just rising when the sun of the worldly is setting forever; his 

    best things are all beginning to blossom and bloom forever, when those of 

    the worldly are all slipping out of his hands, and passing away.<br>

    <br>

    Young men, these things are true. Listen to the word of exhortation. Be 

    persuaded. Take up the cross. Follow Christ. Yield yourselves to God.</p>
