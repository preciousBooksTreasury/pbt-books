</p><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>ACCORDING TO  </b></font>

</p><p align="center"><b><font size="4">PART FIRST.</font></b><font size="4">  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">HAVING particularly guarded, in the preceding 
discourse, the doctrine of salvation by the covenant of grace, and 
having endeavoured to secure the foundation of the Gospel against the 
unwearied attacks of the Pharisees, I shall now particularly guard the 
works of the covenant of grace, and by that means I shall secure the 
superstructure against the perpetual assaults of the Antinomians; a part
 of my work this, which is so much the more important, as the use of a 
strong foundation is only to bear up a useful structure.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">None but fools act without motive. To deprive a 
wise man of every motive to act, is to keep him in total inaction: and 
to rob him of some grand motive, is considerably to weaken his 
willingness to act, or his fervour in acting. The burning love of God is
 undoubtedly the most generous motive to obedience; but alas! thousands 
of good men, like Cornelius, are yet strangers to that powerful 
principle shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost. In thousands of
 weak believers love is not yet properly kindled; it is rather a smoking
 flax than a blazing fire; in thousands of Laodicean professors it is 
scarcely lukewarm; and in all apostates it is waxed cold. Therefore, in 
the sickly state of the Church militant, it is as absurd for any 
preachers to urge no motive of good works but grateful love, as it would
 be in physicians to insist that a good stomach must be the only motive 
from which their patients ought to take either food or physic.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Our Lord, far from countenancing our doctrinal 
refinements in this respect, perpetually secures the practice of good 
works, by promising heaven to all that persevere in doing them; while he
 deters us from sin, by threatening destruction to all that persist in 
committing it; working thus alternately upon our hopes and fears, those 
powerful springs of action in the human breast.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The force of this double incentive to practical 
religion I greatly weakened, when, being carried away by the stream of 
Solifidianism, I rashly said in my old sermon, after some of our 
reformers, that "good works shall be rewarded in heaven and eternal 
life, although not with eternal life and heaven." An Antinomian error 
this, which I again publicly renounce, and against which I enter the 
following Scriptural protest.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If the oracles of God command us to work from an 
initial life of grace for an eternal life of glory, frequently annexing 
the promise of heavenly bliss to good works, and threatening all workers
 of iniquity with hell torments; it follows, that heaven will be the 
gracious reward of good works, and hell the just wages of bad ones.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I readily grant, however, that if we consider 
ourselves merely as sinners, in the light of the first Gospel axiom, and
 according to the covenant of works, which we have so frequently broken,
 heaven is merely the gift of God through our Lord Jesus Christ: for, 
according to that covenant, destruction is the wages of all who have 
committed sin. But if we be converted sinners, or obedient believers, 
and if we consider ourselves in the light of the second Gospel axiom, 
and according to the covenant of grace, every unprejudiced person, who 
believes the Bible, must allow that heaven is the gracious reward of our
 works of faith.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">An illustration may help the reader to see the 
justness of this distinction. A charitable nobleman discharges the debts
 of ten insolvent prisoners, sets them up in great or little farms, 
according to their respective abilities, and laying down a thousand 
pounds before them, he says:-"I have already done much for you, but I 
will do more still. I freely give you this purse to encourage your 
industry. You shall share this gold among you, if you manage your farms 
according to my directions; but if you let your fields be overrun with 
thorns, you shall not only lose the bounty I design for the industrious,
 but forfeit all my preceding favours." Now, who does not see that the 
thousand pounds thus laid down are a free gift of the nobleman; that 
nevertheless, upon the performance of the condition or terms he has 
fixed, they become a gracious reward of industry; and that consequently 
the obtaining of this reward turns now entirely upon the works of 
industry performed by the farmers.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Just so eternal salvation is the free gift of God 
through Jesus Christ; and yet the obtaining of it (on the part of 
adults) turns entirely upon their works of faith; that is, upon their 
works as well as upon their faith. Hence the Scripture says, "He that 
believeth is not condemned;" and, "If thou doest well shalt thou not be 
accepted?" "We that believe are justified;" and, "He that worketh 
righteousness is accepted." Our Lord, speaking of a weeping penitent, 
says equally: "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved 
much;" and, "Thy sins are forgiven; thy faith hath saved thee." As for 
St. Paul, though he always justly excludes the works of unbelief, and 
merely ceremonial works, yet he so joins faith, and the works of faith, 
as to show us they are equally necessary to eternal salvation. "There is
 no condemnation," says he, "to them that are in Christ by faith," (here
 is the Pharisee's portion,) "who walk not after the flesh, but after 
the Spirit." (Here is the Antinomian's portion.) Hence it appears, that 
living faith now and always works righteousness, and that the works of 
righteousness now and always accompany faith, so long as it remains 
living.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"I know this is the doctrine," says the judicious 
Mr. Baxter," that will have the loudest outcries raised against it, and 
will make some cry out, <i>Heresy, Popery, Socinianism! </i>and what 
not? For my own part, the Searcher of hearts knoweth that not 
singularity, nor any good will to Popery, provoketh me to entertain it: 
but that I have earnestly [?] use the word now, to stop up the 
Antinomian gap which one of my opponents tries to keep open by 
insinuating, that though a true believer may commit adultery and murder 
now, yet he will always work righteousness before he die.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I sought the Lord's direction upon my knees before
 I durst adventure on it; and that I resisted the light of this 
conclusion as long as I was able." May this bright testimony make way 
for an illuminated cloud of prophets and apostles! and may the Sun of 
righteousness, rising behind it, so scatter the shades of error, that we
 may awake out of our Laodicean sleep, and Antinomian dreams, and see a 
glorious, unclouded Gospel day!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">That, in subordination to Christ, our eternal 
salvation depends upon good works, i.e., upon the works of faith, will, I
 think, appear indubitable to them that believe the Bible, and candidly 
consider the following scriptures, in which heaven and eternal life in 
glory are suspended upon works, if they spring from a sincere belief in 
the light of our dispensation; I say, if they spring from true faith, it
 being absolutely impossible for a heathen, and much more for a 
Christian, to work righteousness without believing in some degree "that 
God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him," 
as well as the punisher of them that presumptuously sin against him. 
"For without faith it is impossible to please God;" all faithless works 
springing merely from superstition, like those of Baal's priests, or 
from hypocrisy, like those of the Pharisees. Having thus guarded again 
the doctrine of faith, I produce some of the many scriptures that 
directly or indirectly annex the above-mentioned reward to works: And,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. <i>To consideration, conversion, and exercising ourselves in godliness.-"</i>Because
 he considereth, and turneth away from his transgressions, &amp;c, he 
shall surely live, he shall not die. When the wicked man turneth away 
from his wickedness, &amp;c, he shall save his soul alive. Wherefore 
turn yourselves and live ye. Exercise thyself unto godliness, for it is 
profitable unto all things; having the promise of the life that now is, 
and that which is to come."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. <i>To doing the will of God.</i>-"He that does 
the will of my Father shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. He that 
does the will of God abideth for ever. Whosoever shall do the will of 
God, the same is my brother and sister, i.e. the same is an heir of God,
 and a joint heir with Christ."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. <i>To confessing Christ, and calling upon the name of the Lord.- </i>"With
 the mouth confession is made to salvation. Whosoever, therefore, shall 
confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father: but 
whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my 
Father. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>4. To self denial-</i>"If thy hand offend thee,
 cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than 
having two hands to go to hell, &amp;c. And if thine eye offend thee, 
pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God 
with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. There is 
no man that hath left house, or brethren, &amp;c, for my sake and the 
Gospel's, but he shall receive a hundred fold now, and in the world to 
come eternal life. He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it, 
&amp;c. He that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life 
eternal." And our Lord supposes that by "gaining the world" a man may 
"lose his own soul:" for, according to the covenant of grace, even 
reprobates are not totally lost till they make themselves sons of 
perdition, like Judas, i.e. till they personally and absolutely "lose 
their own souls" and heaven by their personal and obstinate pursuit of 
worldly things.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. <i>To diligent labour and earnest endeavours.</i>-"O
 man of God, lay hold on eternal life. Work out your own salvation. 
Labour for the meat that endureth to everlasting life. Keep thy heart 
with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. In so doing 
thou shalt save thyself. Narrow is the gate that leads to life. Strive 
to enter in. The violent press into the kingdom of God, and take it by 
force." <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>6. To keeping the commandments.</i>-"Blessed 
are they that do his commandments, &amp;c, that they may enter through 
the gates into the city, i.e. into heaven. There shall in no wise enter 
into it any thing that worketh abomination. If thou wilt enter into 
life,* keep the commandments. Thou hast answered right; this do and thou
 shalt live. There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: 
[some of whose laws run thus:] Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. 
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. With what 
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. For he shall have judgment 
without mercy, that hath showed no mercy. Blessed are the peace makers, 
for they shall be called the children of God, [and, of course, the heirs
 of the kingdom.] The King shall say unto them, Come, ye blessed of my 
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, for I was hungry and ye 
gave me meat, &amp;c. Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, 
knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance:
 but he that does wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done,
 and there is no respect of persons. Be ye therefore followers of God as
 dear children, &amp;c, for this ye know, that no whore-monger, &amp;c, 
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God. The works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are these, adultery, &amp;c, of which I tell you 
[believers] that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom 
of God."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * See the excellent comment of our Church upon these words of our Lord, Fourth Check. ]<i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>7. To running, fighting, faithfully laying up treasure in heaven, and feeding the flock of God.-</i>"They
 who run in a race run all; but one receiveth the prize: so run that you
 may obtain. Now they are temperate in all things to obtain a 
corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, fight, 
and bring my body into subjection, [that I may obtain;] lest I myself 
should be cast away;" i.e. should not be approved of, should be 
rejected, and lose my incorruptible crown. "Fight the good fight of 
faith, lay hold on eternal life. Lay up treasure in heaven. Make 
yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when you 
fail on earth they may receive you into everlasting habitations. Charge 
them who are rich that they do good, that they be rich in good works, 
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to 
come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. Feed the flock of God, 
&amp;c, being examples to the flock, and when the chief Shepherd shall 
appear, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">8. <i>To love and charity.-"</i>Though I have all 
faith, &amp;c, and have no charity, I am nothing. She [the woman] shall 
be saved, &amp;c, if they [womankind] continue in faith and charity. 
Whosoever hateth his brother hath not eternal life. He that loveth not 
his brother abideth in death. We know we have passed from death unto 
life, because we love the brethren. If any man love not the Lord Jesus, 
let him be anathema. The crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to 
them that love him."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">9. <i>To a godly walk.-"</i>There is no 
condemnation to them, &amp;c, that walk not after the flesh. As many as 
walk according to this rule, mercy [be, or will be] on them. If we walk 
in the light [of good works, Matt. v, 15,] the blood of Christ cleanseth
 us from all sin. The Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing 
will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Many [fallen believers] 
walk, &amp;c, enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction."
  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">10. <i>To persevering watchfulness, faithfulness, prayer, &amp;c.-"</i>He
 that endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved. Be faithful unto 
death, and I will give thee the crown of life. Blessed is the man that 
endureth temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of 
life. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep 
thee, &amp;c. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my 
throne. To him that keepeth my words unto the end, &amp;c, will I give 
the morning star. Take heed to yourselves, &amp;c, watch and pray 
always, that ye may be counted worthy to escape, &amp;c, and to stand 
before the Son of man." In a word,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">11. <i>To patient continuance in mortifying the deeds of the body, and in well doing.-"</i>If
 ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit 
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For he that soweth to his 
flesh, shall of the flesh reap perdition; but he that soweth to the 
Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be 
weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap, [not if we faint 
or not, but] if we faint not. He that reapeth receiveth wages and 
gathereth fruit unto life eternal. Ye have your fruit unto holiness, and
 the end everlasting life." God, at the revelation of his righteous 
judgment "will render to every man according to his deeds; eternal life 
to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory. 
Anguish upon every soul of man that does evil, &amp;c, but glory to 
every man that worketh good, &amp;c, for there is no respect of persons 
with God."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Is it not astonishing, that in sight of so many 
plain scriptures the Solifidians should still ridicule the passport of 
good works, and give it to the winds as a "paper kite?<i>" </i>However, 
if the preceding texts do not appear sufficient, I can send another 
volley of Gospel truths, to show that the initial salvation of believers
 themselves may be lost through bad works.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I know thy works, &amp;c, so then, "because thou 
art lukewarm, I will spue thee out of my mouth." "What doth it profit, 
my brethren, though a man [(tis) any one, and two verses below, any one 
[greek], James ii, 14, 16,] say he hath faith, and hath not works," 
know?] "Can faith save him, &amp;c? Faith if it hath not works is dead, 
being alone. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be 
condemned." [In the original it is the same word which is rendered 
damned, Mark xvi, 16.] "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If 
we deny him, he will also deny us. Add to your faith virtue, &amp;c, 
charity, &amp;c. If ye do these things ye shall never fall, for so an 
entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting 
kingdom of our Lord. It had been better for them that [gap]e escaped the
 pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Saviour, [i.e. for
 believers,] not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they
 have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. 
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into 
the fire. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit my Father taketh 
away. Abide in me, &amp;c. If a man abide not in me [by keeping my 
commandments in faith] he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; 
and [he shall share the fate of the branches that have really belonged 
to the natural vine, and now bear no more fruit] men gather them, and 
cast them into the fire, and they are burned." The fig tree in the 
Lord's moral vineyard is cut down for not bearing fruit. "Him that 
sinneth I will blot out of my book. Some, having put away a good 
conscience, concerning faith have made shipwreck. Such as turn back to 
their own wickedness, the Lord shall lead them forth with the evil 
doers. Toward thee goodness, if [by continuing in obedience] thou 
continue in his goodness, otherwise thou shalt be cut off."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: "For the wickedness of their doings I will 
drive them out of my house, I will love them no more. Some are already 
turned aside after Satan, having damnation because they have cast off 
their first faith; the faith that works by love; the mystery of faith 
kept in a pure conscience; the faith unfeigned [that the apostle couples
 with] a good conscience;" the faith that is made perfect by works; the 
faith that cries, like Rachel, Give me children, give me good works, or 
else I die;-the faith that faints without obedience, and actually dies 
by bad works; the following scriptures abundantly proving that faith, 
and consequently the just who live by faith, may die by bad works.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"When a righteous man doth turn from his 
righteousness and commit iniquity, &amp;c, he shall die in his sin, and 
his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered," Ezek. iii,
 20. Again:  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"When the righteous *, &amp;c, does according to 
all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his 
righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass 
that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them 
shall he die," Ezek. xviii,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* That this is spoken of a truly righteous man, 
i.e. of a believer, appears from the following reasons: (1.) The 
righteous here mentioned is opposed to the wicked mentioned in the 
context. As surely then as the word wicked means there one really 
wicked, so does the word righteous mean here one truly righteous. (2.) 
The righteous man's turning from his righteousness is opposed to the 
wicked man's turning from his iniquity. If therefore the righteous man's
 righteousness is to be understood of feigned goodness, so the wicked 
man's iniquity must be understood of feigned iniquity. (3.) The crime of
 the righteous man here spoken of is turning from his righteousness: but
 if his righteousness were only a hypocritical righteousness, he would 
rather deserve to be commended for renouncing it; a wicked, sly Pharisee
 being more odious to God than a barefaced sinner, who has honesty 
enough not to put on the mask of religion, Rev. iii, 15. (4.) Part of 
this apostate's punishment will consist in not having the righteousness 
that he has done remembered. But if his righteousness is a false 
righteousness, or mere hypocrisy, the Divine threatening proves a 
precious promise; for you cannot please a hypocrite better than by 
assuring him that his hypocrisy shall never be remembered. What a pity 
is it, that to defend our mistakes we should load egregious nonsense and
 gross contradiction upon the only wise God!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">24<i>. </i>Once more: "The righteousness of the 
righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression, &amp;c.
 When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live;*- if he trust to
 his righteousness, and commit iniquity, he shall die for it," Ezek. 
xxxiii, 13.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* These words are another indubitable proof that 
the righteous here mentioned is a truly righteous person; as the holy 
and true God would never say to a wicked Pharisee, that he shall surely 
live.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">It seems that God, foreseeing the Solifidians 
would be hard of belief, notwithstanding the great ado they make about 
faith, condescended to their infirmity, and kindly spoke the same thing 
over and over; for setting again the broad seal of heaven to the truth 
that chiefly guards the second Gospel axiom, he says for the fourth 
time, "When the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth 
iniquity, he shall even die thereby: but if the wicked turn from his 
wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live 
thereby," Ezek. xxxiii, 18, 19.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If Ezekiel be not allowed to be a competent judge,
 let Christ himself be heard: "Then his Lord said unto him, O thou 
wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, &amp;c; shouldst not thou 
also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on 
thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors," 
Matt. xviii, 26, &amp;c.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">All the preceding scriptures are thus summed up by
 our Lord, Matt. xxv, 46, "These [the persons who have not finally done 
the works of faith] shall go into everlasting punishment; but the 
righteous [those who have done them to the end, at least from the time 
of their re-conversion, if they were backsliders] shall go into eternal 
life." This doctrine agrees perfectly with the conclusion of the sermon 
on the mount: "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
 will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock. And 
every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall 
be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand."- Nay,
 this is Christ's explicit doctrine. No words can be plainer than these;
 "They that are in their graves shall hear his voice and come forth; 
they that have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that 
have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation," John v, 29. All 
creeds, therefore, like that of St. Athanasius, and all faith, must end 
in practice. This is a grand article of what might, with peculiar 
propriety, be called the catholic faith-the faith that is common to, and
 essential under all the dispensations of the everlasting Gospel, in all
 countries and ages: "the faith which, except a man believe faithfully,"
 i.e. so as to work righteousness, like the good and faithful servant, 
"he cannot be saved."  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">PART SECOND.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">As some difficulties probably rise in the reader's
 mind against the preceding doctrine, it may not be amiss to produce 
them in the form of objections, and to answer them more fully than I 
have yet done.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I. OBJECTION. "All the scriptures that you have 
produced, are nothing but descriptions of those who shall be saved or 
damned: you have therefore no ground to infer from such texts, that in 
the great day our works of faith shall be rewarded with an eternal life 
of glory, and our bad works punished with eternal death."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER. Of all the paradoxes advanced by mistaken 
divines, your assertion is perhaps the greatest. You have no more ground
 for it than I have for saying that England is a lawless kingdom, and 
that all the promises of rewards, and threatenings of punishments, 
stamped with the authority of the legislative power, are no legal 
sanctions. If I seriously maintained that the bestowing of public 
bounties upon the inventors of useful arts; that the discharge of some 
prisoners, and the condemnation of others, according to the statutes of 
the realm, are things which take place without any respect to law; that 
the acts of parliament are mere descriptions of persons, which the 
government rewards, acquits, or punishes without any respect to 
worthiness, innocence, or demerit; and that the judges absolve or 
condemn criminals merely out of free grace and free wrath; if I 
maintained a paradox so dishonourable to the government and so contrary 
to common sense, would you not be astonished! And if I gave the name of 
Papist to all that did not receive my error as Gospel, would you not 
recommend me to a dose of Dr. Monro's hellebore? And are they much 
wiser, who fix the foul blot upon the Divine government, and make the 
Protestants believe that the sanctions of the King of kings, and the 
judicial dictates of Him who judges the world in righteousness, are not 
laws and sentences, but representations and descriptions?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">A comparison will show the frivolousness of your 
objection. There is, if I mistake not, a statute that condemns a 
highwayman to be hanged, and allows a reward of forty pounds to the 
person that takes him. A counsellor observes that this statute was 
undoubtedly made to deter people from going upon the highway, and to 
encourage the taking of robbers. "Not so," says a lawyer from Geneva; 
"though robbers are hanged according to law, yet the men that take them 
are not legally rewarded; the sum mentioned in the statute is given them
 of free, gratuitous, undeserved, unmerited, distinguishing grace." Nay,
 says the counsellor, if they do not deserve the forty pounds more than 
other people, that sum might as well be bestowed upon the highwaymen 
themselves as upon those who take them at the hazard of their life. "And
 so it might," says the Geneva lawyer; "for although poor, blind 
legalists make people believe that the promissory part of the law was 
made to excite people to exert themselves in the taking of robbers; yet 
we know better at Geneva; and I inform you that the clause you speak of 
is only a description of certain men, for whom the government designs 
the reward of forty pounds gratis." The admirers of Geneva logic clap 
their hands and cry out, "Well said! down with legality!" but an English
 jury smiles and cries, "Down with absurdity!"<i> </i>(See <i>Fourth Check, </i>p. 273.)  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">II. OBJECTION. "You confound our title to, with 
our meetness for heaven, two things which we carefully distinguish. Our 
title to heaven, being solely what Christ has done and suffered for his 
people, has nothing to do with either our holiness or good works; but 
our meetness for heaven supposes holiness, if not good works. Therefore 
God's unconverted, sinful people, who have, in Christ, a complete title 
to heaven, by right of finished salvation, '"shall all be made meet for 
heaven in the day of his power."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER 1. I understand you, and so does Mr. 
Fulsome. You insinuate that, till the day you speak of comes, 
unconverted sinners and backsliders may indulge themselves like the 
servant mentioned in the Gospel, who said, My master delayeth his 
coming, and began to drink with the drunken; but alas! instead of "a day
 of power," he saw a day of vengeance, and his "finished salvation," so 
called, ended in weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. Your distinction is contrary to the Scriptures,
 which represent all impenitent workers of iniquity as having a full 
title to hell according to both law and Gospel; so far are the oracles 
of God from supposing that some workers of iniquity have a full title to
 heaven, absolutely independent on the obedience of faith.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. It is contrary to reason; for reason dictates 
that whosoever has a full title to a punishment, or to a reward, is 
fully meet for it. Where is the difference between saying that a 
murderer is fully meet for, or that he has a full title to the gallows? 
If a palace richly furnished was bestowed upon the most righteous man in
 the kingdom, and you were the person, would it not be absurd to 
distinguish between your title to, and your meetness for that 
recompense? Or if the king, in consequence of a valuable consideration 
received from the prince, had promised a coronet to every swift runner 
in England, next to the prince's interposition and his majesty's 
promise, would not your running well be at once your title to, and 
meetness for that honour! And is not this the case with respect to the 
incorruptible crowns reserved in heaven for those who so run that they 
may obtain?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. Your distinction draws after it the most horrid
 consequences: for if a full title to heaven may be separated from a 
meetness for the lowest place in heaven, it necessarily follows that 
Solomon had a full title to heaven when he worshipped Ashtaroth; and the
 incestuous Corinthian when he defiled his father's bed; in flat 
opposition to the dictates of every man's conscience, (if you except Mr.
 Fulsome and his fraternity.) It follows that St. Paul told a gross 
untruth when he said, "This ye know, that no idolater and no unclean 
person hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." In a 
word, it follows that believers "sanctified with the blood of the 
covenant, who draw back to perdition," (such as the apostates mentioned 
Heb. x, 29,) may have no title to heaven in all their sanctifying faith;
 while some impenitent murderers, like David and Manasses, have a 
perfect title to it in all their crimes and unbelief.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. This <i>is </i>not all. Our Lord's mark, "By 
their fruits ye shall know them," is absolutely wrong if you are right: 
for your distinction abolishes the grand characteristic of the children 
of God and those of the devil, which consists in not committing or 
committing iniquity, from doing or not doing righteousness, according to
 these plain words of St. John, "He that committeth sin is of the devil.
 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
devil. Whosoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that 
loveth not [much less he that murders] his brother," I John iii, 8, 10. 
Thus the Lord's sacred enclosure is broken down, his sheepfold becomes a
 fold for goats, a dog kennel, a swine stye. Nay, for what you know, all
 bloody adulterers may be "sheep in wolves' clothing;" while all "those 
that have escaped the pollution that is in the world" may only be 
"wolves in sheep's clothing;" it mattering not, with regard to the 
goodness of our title to heaven, whether "filthiness to Belial," or 
"holiness to the Lord" be written upon our foreheads. O sir, how much 
more dangerous is your scheme than that of the primitive Babel builders!
 They only brought on a confusion of the original language; but your 
doctrine confounds light and darkness, promises and threatenings, the 
heirs of heaven and those of hell, the seed of the woman and that of the
 serpent.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">II. As to your intimation that holiness is secured
 by teaching that God's people shall absolutely be made willing to 
forsake their sins, and to become righteous in the day of God's power, 
that so they may have a meetness for, as well as a title to heaven; it 
drags after it this horrid consequence: the devil's people, "in the day 
of God's power," shall absolutely be made willing to forsake their 
righteousness, that they may have a meetness for, as well as a title to 
hell. A bitter reverse this of your "sweet Gospel!"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To conclude. If by your distinction you only want 
to insinuate that Christ is the grand and properly meritorious procurer 
of our salvation, from first to last, and that the works of faith are 
only a secondary, instrumental, evidencing cause of our final salvation,
 you mean just as I do. But if you give the world to understand that 
election to eternal glory is unconditional, or, which comes all to one, 
that no sin can invalidate our title to heaven; from the preceding 
observations it appears that you deceive the simple, make Christ the 
minister of sin, and inadvertently poison the Church with the rankest 
Antinomianism.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">III. OBJECTION. "You call the works of Christ the 
primary and properly meritorious cause, and our works of faith the 
secondary and instrumental cause of our eternal salvation. But according
 to your doctrine, our works should be called the first cause, and 
Christ's work the second: for you make the final success of Christ's 
work to depend on our work, which is manifestly setting our performances
 above those of the Redeemer."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER 1. When a gardener affirms that he shall 
have no crop unless he dig and set his garden, does he manifestly set 
his work above that of the God of nature? And when we say that "we shall
 not reap final salvation, if we do not work out our salvation," do we 
exalt ourselves above the God of grace?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. Whether our free agency turns the scale for 
life or death, to all eternity Christ shall have the honour of having 
died to bestow an initial life of grace even upon those who choose death
 in the error of their ways, God to have made them gracious and sincere 
offers of an eternal life of glory. In this sense then Christ's work 
cannot be rendered ineffectual; it being his absolute decree that the 
word of his grace shall be the savour of life to obedient free agents, 
and the savour of death to the disobedient. Therefore, if we will not 
have the eternal benefit of his Redeeming work, we cannot take from him 
the eternal honour of having shed his blood even for those who tread it 
under foot, and who "bring upon themselves swift destruction by denying 
the Lord that bought them."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. Christ is not dishonoured by the doctrine that 
represents the effect of the greater wheel as being thus in part 
suspended upon the turning of the less. The light of the sun shines in 
vain for me if I shut <i>my </i>eyes. Life is a far nobler gift than 
food. I can give my starving neighbour bread, but I cannot give him 
life. Nevertheless, the higher wheel stops, if the inferior is quite at a
 stand: he must die if he has no nourishment. Thus, by God's 
appointment, the preservation of all the first born of the Israelites in
 Egypt depended upon the sprinkling of a lamb's blood; the life of all 
them that were bitten by the fiery serpents was suspended on a look 
toward the brazen serpent; and that of Rahab and her friends hung, if I 
may so speak, on a scarlet thread. Now, if God did not dishonour his 
wisdom when he made the life of so many people to depend upon those 
seemingly insignificant works; and if he continues to make the life of 
all mankind depend upon breathing; is it reasonable to say that he is 
dishonoured by his own doctrine, which suspends our eternal salvation 
upon the works of faith?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. Your objection can be retorted. Most Calvinists
 grant that our justification in the day of conversion depends our 
believing. Thus the Rev. Mr. Madan, in his sermon on James ii, 24, (p. 
18,) says, "Though the Lord Jesus has merited our justification before 
God, yet we are not actually justified, till He be received into the 
heart by faith, and rested on," &amp;c. Therefore, in the day of 
conversion, that great mediator being judge, our justification is 
suspended on the work which he calls "receiving Christ," or "resting on 
him." And how much more may our eternal salvation be suspended on faith 
and works; i.e. on resting upon Christ and working righteousness!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. This is not all. Both Mr. Madan and Mr. Hill 
call faith the instrumental CAUSE of our justification, and every body 
knows that the effect is always suspended on the CAUSE. Now, if so great
 an effect as a sinner's present justification may be suspended upon the
 single CAUSE of faith, why may not a believer's eternal justification 
be suspended upon the double CAUSE of faith and its works? In a word, 
why must Mr. Wesley be represented as heterodox for insinuating that 
believing and working instrumentally CAUSE our eternal justification; 
when Mr. Madan wears the badge of orthodoxy, although he insinuates that
 believing instrumentally CAUSES our justification?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If Mr. Madan say that he allows faith to be an 
instrumental CAUSE, on account of its being the gift of God by which we 
receive Christ; I answer, that we allow the work of faith to be an 
instrumental cause, because it springs from the Spirit of Christ, and 
constitutes our likeness to Christ, and our evangelical righteousness; a
 righteousness this which Christ came into the world to promote. "For 
God sending his Son, &amp;c, condemned sin in the flesh, that the 
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after 
the flesh, but after the Spirit," i.e. we walk in good works. If it is 
asserted that there can be but one instrumental cause of our salvation, 
that is, faith; I appeal to reason, which dictates that Christian faith 
implies a variety of Causes, such as preaching Christ, and hearing him 
preached: for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
This argument, therefore, carries its own answer along with it.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">6. To conclude: Mr. Madan, in the above-quoted 
sermon, (P. 16,) says with great truth:-"Christ and faith are not one 
and the same thing; how then can we reconcile the apostle with himself, 
when he says, in one place, we are justified by Christ; and in another, 
we are justified by faith? This can only be done by having recourse to 
the plain distinction which the Scriptures afford us in considering 
Christ as the meritorious cause, and faith as the instrumental cause, or
 that by which the meritorious cause is applied unto us, so that we are 
benefited thereby." Now all our heresy consists in applying Mr. Madan's 
judicious reasoning to all the scriptures that guard the second Gospel 
axiom, thus: "How can we reconcile the apostle with himself, when he 
says in one place, 'We are saved by Christ,' and in other places, 'We 
are saved by faith, we are saved by hope. Work out your own salvation. 
Confession is made to salvation,' &amp;c, for Christ and faith, Christ 
and hope, Christ and works, Christ and making confession, are not one 
and the same thing? This seeming inconsistency in St. Paul's doctrine 
vanishes by admitting a plain distinction, which the Scriptures afford 
us: that is, (1.) By considering Christ, from first to last, as the 
properly meritorious cause of our present and eternal salvation. (2.) By
 considering faith as the instrumental cause of our salvation from the 
guilt and pollution of sin on earth. And, (3.) By considering the work's
 of faith not only as the evidencing cause of our justification in the 
great day, but also as an instrumental cause of our continuing in the 
life of faith; just as eating, drinking, breathing, and such works, that
 spring from natural life, are instrumental causes of our continuing in 
natural life." Thus faith, and its works, are two inferior causes, 
whereby the properly meritorious cause is so completely applied to 
obedient, persevering believers, that they are now, and for ever shall 
be benefited by it. As I flatter myself that this six-fold answer 
satisfies the candid reader, I pass on to another plausible objection.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">IV. OBJECTION. "Though you assert that from first 
to last the works and sufferings of Christ are the grand and properly 
meritorious cause of our salvation; yet, according to your scheme, man 
having a life of glory upon his choice, and heaven upon working out his 
salvation, the honour of free grace is not secured. For, after all, free
 will and human faithfulness, or unfaithfulness, turn the scale for 
eternal salvation or damnation."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER. l. In the very nature of things we are 
free agents, or the wise and righteous God would act inconsistently with
 his wisdom and equity in dispensing rewards and punishments. If, 
through "the saving grace of God" which "has appeared to all men," we 
were not again endued with an awful power to "choose life," and to be 
faithful, it would be as injudicious to punish or recompense mankind as 
to whip a dead horse for not moving, condemn fire for burning, or grant 
water an eternal reward for its fluidity.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. Were I ashamed of my moral free agency, I 
should be ashamed of the noble power that distinguishes me from the 
brute creation. I should be ashamed of the Old Testament, and of Moses, 
who says, "Behold, I call heaven and earth to record, that I have set 
before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life."
 I should be ashamed of the New Testament, and of Christ, who complains,
 "You will not come unto me that you might have life," i.e. you will not
 use the power which my preventing grace has given you, that you might 
live here a life of faith and holiness, and be hereafter rewarded with a
 life of happiness and glory. In a word, I should give up the second 
Gospel axiom, and tacitly reproach my Maker, who says, "Why will ye die,
 O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that 
dieth; wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. To convince you that free agency, and a right 
use of it, arc by no means inconsistent with Divine grace and genuine 
humility, I ask, Did not God endue our first parents with free will? Are
 not even some rigid Calvinists ashamed to deny it? If free will in man 
is a power dishonourable to God, did not our wise Creator mistake when 
he pronounced man "very good," at the very time man was a free willer? 
For how could man be very good if he had within him a power that 
necessarily militates against the honour of God, as the Calvinists 
insinuate free will does!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. I go one step farther, and ask, Did God ever 
endue one child of Adam with power to avoid one sin? If you say no, you 
contradict the Scriptures, your own conscience, and the consciences of 
all mankind; you fix the blot of folly on all the judges who have 
judicially punished malefactors with death; and when you insinuate that 
the Lawgiver of the universe will send all workers of iniquity 
personally into hell for not "doing what is lawful and right to save 
their souls alive," or for not avoiding sin, when he never gave them the
 least power personally so to do, you pour almost as much contempt upon 
his perfections as if you hinted that he will one day raise all creeping
 insects, to judge them according to their steps, and to cast into a 
place of torment as many as did not move as swiftly as a race horse.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If you answer in the affirmative, and grant that 
God has graciously endued one child of Adam with power to avoid one sin,
 so far you hold free will as well as Moses and Jesus Christ. Now if God
 has bestowed free will upon one child of Adam with respect to the 
avoiding of one sin; why not upon two, with respect to the avoiding of 
two sins? Why not upon all, with respect to the avoiding of all the sins
 that are incompatible with the obedience of faith?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. Again: as it would be absurd to say that God 
gave a power to avoid one sin only to one child of Adam; so it would be 
impious to suppose God gave him this power, that, in case he faithfully 
used it, he should necessarily boast of it. Pharisaic boasting is then 
by no means the necessary consequence of our moral liberty, or of a 
proper use of our free will. Thus it appears that your specious 
objection is founded upon a heap of paradoxes; and that to embrace free 
wrath lest we should not make enough of free grace, and to jump into 
fatalism lest we should be proud of our free will, is not less absurd 
than to prostrate ourselves before a traitor lest we should not honour 
the king, and to run to a house of ill fame lest we should be proud of 
our chastity.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">II. Our doctrine secures the honour of free grace 
as well as Calvinism. You will be convinced of it if you consider the 
following articles of our creed with respect to free grace:-(1.) Before 
the fall, the free grace of our Creator gave us in Adam holiness, 
happiness, and a power to continue in both. (2.) Since the fall, the 
free grace of our Redeemer indulges us with a reprieve, an accepted 
time, a day of visitation and salvation; in a word, with a better 
covenant, and a "free gift that is come upon all men unto [initial] 
justification of life," Rom. v, 15. (3.) That nothing may be wanted on 
God's part, the free grace of our Sanctifier excites us to make a proper
 use of the free gift, part of which is moral liberty. (4.) Thus even 
our free will to good is all of creating, redeeming, and sanctifying 
grace. Therefore, with regard to that glorious power, as well as to 
every other talent, we humbly ask, with St. Paul, "What hast thou, that 
thou hast not received?" (5.) This is not all: we are commanded to 
"account the long suffering of God [a degree of] salvation;" and so it 
is: for without forcing, or necessarily inclining our will, God's 
providential free grace disposes a thousand circumstances in such a 
manner as to second the calls of the everlasting Gospel. The gracious 
Preserver of men works daily a thousand wonders to keep us out of the 
grave, and out of hell. A thousand wheels have turned ten thousand 
times, in and out of the Church, to bring us the purest streams of 
Gospel truth. Countless breathings of the Spirit of grace add virtue to 
those streams; free grace therefore not only prevents, but also in 
numberless ways accompanies, follows, directs, encourages, and assists 
us in all the works of our salvation.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">And yet, while God thus works in us as the God of 
all grace, "both to will and to do of his good pleasure;" that is, while
 he thus gives us the faculty to will, and the power to do; and while he
 secretly, by his Spirit, and publicly, by his ministers and 
providences, excites us to make a proper use of that faculty and power; 
yet, as the God of wisdom, holiness, and justice, he leaves the act to 
our choice; thus treating us as rational creatures, whom he intends 
wisely to reward, or justly to punish, according to their works, and not
 according to his own.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hence it appears that we go every step of the way 
with our Calvinist brethren while they exalt Christ and free grace in a 
rational and Scriptural manner; and that we refuse to follow them only 
when they set Christ at naught as a prophet, a lawgiver, a judge, and a 
king; under pretence of extolling him as a priest; or when they put 
wanton free grace and unrelenting free wrath in the place of the genuine
 free grace testified of in the Scriptures.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">V. OBJECTION. "One more difficulty remains: if I 
freely obey the Gospel and am saved; and if my neighbour freely disobeys
 it and is damned, what makes me to differ from him? Is it not my free 
obedience of faith?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER. Undoubtedly. And his free disobedience 
makes him differ from you; or it would be very absurd judicially to 
acquit and reward you rather than him, according to your works. And it 
would be strange duplicity to condemn and punish him rather than you in a
 day of judgment, after the most solemn protestations that equity and 
impartiality shall dictate the Judge's sentence.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">As to the difficulty arising from St. Paul's 
question, I Cor. iv, 7, "Who maketh thee to differ?" to what I have said
 about it in the preceding sermon, (p. 479,) I add: 1. According to the 
covenant of works "all fall short of the glory of God." And when any one
 asks, with respect to the law of innocence, "Who makes thee to differ?"
 the proper answer is, "There is no difference: every mouth must be 
stopped: all the world is guilty before God:, enter not into judgment 
with thy servant, O Lord." But, according to the covenant of grace, he 
that freely believes and obeys in the strength of free grace, 
undoubtedly makes himself to differ from him that by obstinate 
disobedience "does despite to the Spirit of grace." If this point be 
given up, the Diana and the Apollo, or rather the Apollyon of the 
Antinomians (I mean wanton free grace, and merciless free wrath) are set
 up for ever. However,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. If the question, "Who maketh thee to differ?" 
be asked with respect to the number of our talents, the proper answer 
is, "God's distinguishing grace alone maketh us to differ." And that 
this is the sense which the apostle had in view, is evident from the 
context. He had before reproved the Corinthians for "saying every one, I
 am of Paul, and I of Apollos," &amp;c; and now he adds, "These things I
 have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos, that ye might 
learn in us not to think [of gifted, popular men, or of yourselves] 
above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one 
against another: for who maketh thee to differ?" Why is thy person 
graceful? And why art thou naturally an eloquent man, like Apollos, 
while thy brother's speech is rude, and his bodily presence weak and 
contemptible like mine But,-  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. If you ask, "Who maketh thee to differ?" with 
respect to the improvement or non-improvement of our gifts and graces: 
if you inquire whether God necessitates some to disbelieve that they may
 necessarily sin and be damned; while he necessitates others to believe 
that they may necessarily work righteousness and be saved: I utterly 
deny the last question, and in this sense St. Paul answers his own 
misapplied question thus: "Be not deceived: what a man [not what God] 
soweth, that shall he also reap;" perdition if he sow to the flesh, and 
eternal life if he sow to the Spirit. Nor am I either afraid or ashamed 
to second him, by saying, upon the walls of Jerusalem, that, in the 
last-mentioned sense, <i>We make ourselves to differ. </i>And Scripture,
 reason, conscience, the Divine perfections, and the trump of God, which
 will soon summon us to judgment, testify that this reply stands as firm
 as one half of the Bible, and the second Gospel axiom on which it is 
immovably founded.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Nay, there is not a promise or a threatening in 
the Bible that is not a proof of our Lawgiver's want of wisdom, or of 
our Judge's want of equity, if we are not graciously endued with a 
capacity to make ourselves differ from the obstinate violators of the 
law, and despisers of the Gospel,--that is, if we are not free agents. 
There is not an exhortation, a warning, nor an entreaty in the sacred 
pages, that is not a demonstration of the penman's folly, or of the 
freedom of our will. In a word, there is not a sinner justly punished in
 hell, nor a believer wisely rewarded in heaven, that does not 
indirectly say to all the world of rationals: "Though the God" of grace 
draws thee to obedience, yet it is with "the bands of a man." For, after
 all, he "leaves thee in the hand of thy counsel, to keep the 
commandments, and perform acceptable obedience if thou wilt. Before man 
is life and death, and whether him liketh shall be given him," Ecclus. 
xv, 14, &amp;c.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But, although your obedience of faith makes you to
 differ from your condemned neighbour, you have no reason to reject the 
first Gospel axiom, and to indulge, a boasting contrary to faith and 
free grace: for your Christian faith, which is the root of your 
obedience, is peculiarly the gift of God; whether you consider it as to 
its precious seed, ("the word nigh;") as to its glorious object, (Christ
 and the truth;) as to the means by which that object is revealed, (such
 as preaching and hearing;) as to the opportunities and faculties of 
using those means, (such as life, reason, &amp;c,) or as to the Spirit 
of grace, whose assistance in this case is so important, that he is 
called "the Spirit of faith." And yet that Spirit does not act 
irresistibly; all believers unnecessarily and freely yielding to it, and
 all unbelievers unnecessarily and freely resisting it. So far only does
 the matter turn upon free will. Thus it appears, that although the act 
of faith is ours, we are so much indebted to free grace for it, that 
believers can no more boast* of being their own saviours, because they 
daily believe and work in order to their final salvation, than they can 
boast of being their own preservers, because they daily breathe and eat 
in order to their continued preservation.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">On the other hand, although your condemned 
neighbour's disobedience makes him differ from you, he has no reason to 
reject the second Gospel axiom, and to exculpate himself by charging 
Heaven with capricious partiality and horrid free wrath: because God, 
whose mercy is over all his works, and who is no respecter of persons, 
graciously bestowed a talent of free grace upon him as well as upon you,
 according to one or another of the Divine dispensations. For the royal 
master, mentioned in the Gospel, gave a pound to the servant that buried
 it, as well as to him that gained ten pounds by occupying till his lord
 came.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* There is a two-fold glorying: the one Pharisaic 
and contrary to faith: of this St. Paul speaks, where he says, "Boasting
 is excluded, &amp;c, by the law of faith," Rom. iii, 27. The other 
evangelical and agreeable to faith, since it is a believer's holy 
triumph in God, resulting from the testimony of a good conscience. 
Concerning it the apostle says, "Let every man prove his own work, and 
then shall he have rejoicing [boasting] in himself alone, and not in 
another," Gal. vi, 4. [The word in the original is [<i>καυχησIς] </i>in 
one passage, and [καυχηtIα] in the other.] These seemingly contrary 
doctrines are highly consistent; their opposition answering to that of 
the Gospel axioms. The first axiom allows of no glorying but in Christ, 
who has alone fulfilled the law of works, or the terms of the first 
covenant: but the second axiom allows obedient believers an humble 
[IIαυχημα], "glorying" or "rejoicing," upon their personally fulfilling 
the law of faith, or the gracious terms of the second covenant, 2 Cor. 
i, 12. This rejoicing answers to what St. Paul calls the "witness of our
 own spirit," or "the testimony of a good conscience;" which, next to 
the witness of the word and Spirit concerning God's mercy and Christ's 
blood, is the ground of a Christian's confidence. "Beloved, if our heart
 condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God, &amp;c, because we 
keep his commandments," I John iii, 21, 22. And yet, astonishing! this 
blessed rejoicing, so strongly recommended by St. Paul and St. John, 
who, one would think, knew something of the Gospel, is now represented 
by some modern evangelists as the quintessence of Pharisaism.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"But, upon that footing, what becomes of 
distinguishing grace?" If by, "distinguishing grace" you mean 
Calvinistic partiality, I answer, it must undoubtedly sink, together 
with its inseparable partner, unconditional reprobation, into the pit of
 error, whence they ascended to fill the Church with contentions, and 
the world with infidels. But if you mean <i>Scriptural, distinguishing grace, </i>that
 is, the "manifold wisdom of God," which makes him proceed gradually, 
and admit a pleasing variety in the works of grace, as well as in the 
productions of nature; -if you mean his good pleasure to give the 
heathens one talent, the Jews two, the Papists three, the Protestants 
four; or if you mean the different methods which he uses to call sinners
 to repentance, such as his familiar expostulation with Cain: his 
wonderful warning of Lot's sons-in-law: his rousing King Saul by the 
voice of Samuel, and Saul of Tarsus by the voice of Christ: (Samuel and 
Christ coming, or seeming to come from the invisible world for that 
awful purpose:) his audibly inviting Judas and the rich ruler to follow 
him, promising the latter heavenly treasure if he would give his earthly
 possessions to the poor: his shocking, by preternatural earthquakes the
 consciences of the Philippian jailer and the two malefactors that 
suffered with him: his awakening Ananias, Sapphira, and thousands more 
by the wonders of the day of pentecost, when Lydia and others were 
called only in the common way: if you mean this by "distinguishing 
grace," we are agreed. For grace displayed in as distinguishing a manner
 as it was toward Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida, greatly 
illustrates our Lord's doctrine: "Of him to whom little is given, little
 shall be required; but much shall be required of them that have 
received much;" the equality of God's way not consisting in giving to 
all men a like number of talents, any more than making them all 
archangels; but in treating them all equally, according to the various 
editions of the everlasting Gospel, or law of liberty; and according to 
the good or bad uses they have made of their talents, whether they had 
few or many.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To return to your grand objection: you suppose 
(and this is probably the ground of your mistake) that when a 
deliverance, or a Divine favour, turns upon something which we may do, 
or leave undone, at our option, God is necessarily robbed of his glory. 
But a few queries will easily convince you of your mistake. When God had
 been merciful to Lot and his family, not looking back made all the 
difference between him and his wife; but does it follow that he claimed 
the honour of his narrow escape? Looking at the brazen type of Christ 
made some Israelites differ from others that died of the bite of the 
fiery serpents; but is this a sufficient reason to conclude that the 
healeth men had not sense to distinguish between primary and secondary 
causes, and that they ascribed to their looks the glory due to God for 
graciously contriving the means of their cure? One of your neighbours 
has hanged, and another has poisoned himself; so that not hanging 
yourself, and taking wholesome food, has so far made the difference 
between you and them: but can you reasonably infer that you do not live 
by Divine bounty, and that I rob the Preserver of men of his glory, when
 I affirm that you shall surely die if you do not eat, or if you take 
poison?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Permit me to make you sensible of your mistake by 
one more illustration. An anti-calvinist, who observes that God has 
suspended many of his blessings upon industry, diligently ploughs, sows,
 and weeds his field. A fatalist over the way, lest free grace should 
not have all the glory of his crop, does not turn one clod, and expects 
seed to drop from the clouds into furrows made by an invisible plough on
 a certain day, which he calls "a day of God's power." When harvest 
comes, the one has a crop of wheat, and the other a crop of weeds. Now, 
although industry alone has made the difference between the two fields: 
who is most likely to give God the glory of a crop, the Solifidian 
farmer who reaps thistles - or the laborious husbandman who has joined 
works to his faith in Divine Providence, and joyfully brings his sheaves
 home, saying,-- as St. Paul, "By Divine bounty I have planted and 
Apollos has weeded, but God has given the increase, which is all in 
all?"  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">PART THIRD.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">FLATTERING myself that the preceding answers have 
removed the reader's prejudices, or confirmed him in his attachment to 
genuine free grace, I shall conclude this Essay by some reflections upon
 the pride, or prejudices of those who scruple working with an eye to 
the rewards that God offers with a view to promote the obedience of 
faith.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"If heaven, (say such mistaken persons,) if the 
enjoyment of God in glory be the reward of obedience, and if you work 
with an eye to that reward, you act from self, the basest of all 
motives. Love, and not self interest, sets us, true believers, upon 
action. We work <i>from gratitude </i>and not for profit; <i>from life* </i>and
 not for life. To do good with an eye to a reward, though that reward 
should be a crown of life, is to act as a mercenary wretch, and not as a
 duteous child or a faithful servant."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* 'This is not spoken of pious Calvinists; for 
some of them are remarkably diligent in good works. They are Solifidians
 by halves;-in principle, but not in practice. Their works outshine 
their errors.* I lay nothing to their charge, but inattention, 
prejudice, and glaring inconsistency. I compare them to diligent, 
good-natured druggists, who, among many excellent remedies, sell 
sometimes arsenic. They would not for the world take it themselves, or 
poison their neighbours; but yet they freely retail it, and in so doing 
they are inadvertently the cause of much mischief. Mr. Fulsome, for 
example, could tell which of our Gospel ministers taught him that good 
works are dung, and have nothing to do with eternal salvation. He could 
inform us who lulled him asleep in his sins with the syren songs of 
"unconditional election" and "Finished salvation, in the full extent of 
the word;" that is, he could let us know who gave him his killing dose; 
and numbers of Deists could tell us that a bare taste or smell of 
Calvinism has made them loath the genuine doctrines of grace, just as 
tasting or smelling a tainted partridge has for ever turned some 
people's stomachs against partridge.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* The reader is desired to observe that we 
recommend working from life and gratitude, as well as our opponents. 
Life and thankfulness are two important springs of action, which we use 
as well as they. We maintain, that even those who "have a name to live, 
and are dead in trespasses and sins," cannot be saved without 
"strengthening the things that remain and are ready to die;" and that 
thankfulness for being out of hell, and for having a day of salvation 
through Christ, should be strongly recommended to the chief of sinners. 
But thankfulness and life are not <i>all </i>the springs necessary, in our imperfect state, to move <i>all </i>the wheels of obedience; and we dare no more exclude <i>the other </i>springs, because we have these two, than we dare cut off three of our fingers, because we have a little finger and a thumb.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">This specious error, zealously propagated by 
Molinos, Lady Guyon, and her illustrious convert, Archbishop Fenelon, 
(though afterward renounced by him,) put a stop to a great revival of 
the power of godliness abroad in the last century; and it has already 
struck a fatal blow at the late revival in these kingdoms. I reverence 
and love many that contend for this sentiment; but my regard for the 
truth overbalancing <i>my </i>respect for them, I think it my duty to 
oppose their mistake, as a pernicious refinement of Satan transformed 
into an angel of light. I therefore attack it by the following 
arguments:- </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. This doctrine makes us "wise above what is 
written." We read that hunger and want of bread brought back the 
prodigal son. His father knew it, but instead of treating him as a hired
 servant, he entertained him as a beloved child.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. It sets aside, at a stroke, a considerable part
 of the Bible, which consists in threatenings to deter evil workers, and
 in promises to encourage obedient believers: for if it be base to obey 
in order to obtain a promised reward, it is baser still to do it in 
order to avoid a threatened punishment. Thus the precious grace of 
faith, so far as it is exercised about Divine promises and threatenings,
 is indirectly made void.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. It decries "godly fear," a grand spring of 
action, and preservative of holiness in all free agents that are in a 
state of probation; and by this mean it indirectly charges God with want
 of wisdom, for putting that spring in the breast of innocent man in 
paradise, and for perpetually working upon it in his word and by his 
Spirit, which St. Paul calls "the spirit of bondage unto fear;" because 
it helps us to believe the threatenings denounced against the workers of
 iniquity, and to fear lest ruin should overtake us if we continue in 
our sins.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If ever there was a visible Church without spot 
and wrinkle, it was when the multitude of them that believed were "of 
one heart and of one soul." The worldly mindedness of Ananias and 
Sapphira was the first blemish of the Christian, as Achan's covetousness
 had been of the Jewish Church on this side Jordan. God made an example 
of them, as he had done of Achan; and St. Luke observes upon it that 
"great fear came upon all the Church;" even such fear as kept them from 
"falling after the same example of unbelief." Now were all the primitive
 Christians mean-spirited people, because they were filled with great 
fear of being punished as the first backsliders had been, if they 
apostatized? Is it a reproach to righteous Noah, that "being moved with 
fear he prepared an ark for the saving of his house?" And did our Lord 
legalize the Gospel, when "he began to say to his disciples first of 
all, &amp;c, I say unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill
 the body, &amp;c; but fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath power 
to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him?" Does this mean, "Be 
mercenary: yea, I say unto you, be mercenary?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. Hope has a particular, necessary reference to <i>promises </i>and <i>good things </i>to
 come. Excellent things are spoken of that grace. If St. Paul says, "Ye 
are saved through FAITH," he says also, "We are saved by HOPE." Hence 
St. Peter observes, that "exceeding great promises are given to us, that
 we might be partakers of the Divine nature:" and St. John declares, 
"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as God is 
pure." Now hope never stirs, but in order to obtain good things in view:
 a motive this which our Gospel refiners represent as illiberal and 
base. Their scheme therefore directly tends to ridicule and suppress the
 capital, Christian grace, which faith guards on the left hand, and 
charity on the right.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. Their error springs from a false conclusion. 
Because it is mean to relieve a beggar with an eye to a reward from him,
 they infer that it is mean to do a good work with an eye to a reward 
from God; not considering that a beggar promises nothing, and can give 
nothing valuable; whereas the Parent of good promises and can give 
"eternal life to them that obey him." Their inference is then just as 
absurd as the following argument: "I ought not to set my heart upon an 
earthly, inferior, transitory good; therefore I must not set it upon the
 chief, heavenly, permanent good. It is foolish to shoot at a wrong 
mark; therefore I must not shoot at the right: I must not aim at the 
very mark which God himself has set up for me ultimately to level all my
 actions at, next to his own glory, viz., the enjoyment of himself, the 
light of his countenance, the smiles of his open face, which make the 
heaven of heavens."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">6. God says to Abraham, and in him to all 
believers, "I am thy exceeding great reward." Hence it follows, that the
 higher we rise in holiness and obedience, the nearer we shall be 
admitted to the eternal throne, and the fuller enjoyment we shall have 
of our God and Saviour, our reward and rewarder. Therefore, to overlook 
Divine rewards, is to overlook God himself, who is "our great reward;" 
and to slight "the life to come," of which "godliness has the promise." 
 </font>
</p><p><font size="4">7. The error I oppose can be put in a still 
stronger light. Not to strive to obtain our great reward in full, 
amounts to saying, "Lord, thou art beneath my aim and pursuits: I can do
 without thee, or without so much of thee. I will not bestir myself, and
 do one thing to obtain either the fruition, or a fuller enjoyment of 
thy adorable self." An illustration or two, short as they fall of the 
thing illustrated, may help us to see the great impropriety of such 
conduct. If the king offered to give all officers, who would distinguish
 themselves in the field, his hand to kiss, and a commission in his 
guards, that he might have them near his person; would not military 
gentlemen defeat the intention of this gracious offer, and betray a 
peculiar degree of indifference for his majesty, if in the day of battle
 they would not strike one blow the more on account of the royal 
promise?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: when David asked, What shall be done to him
 that killeth the giant? And when he was informed that Saul would give 
him his daughter in marriage; would the young shepherd have showed his 
regard for the princess, or respect for the monarch, if he had said, "I 
am above minding rewards: what I do, I do freely: I scorn acting from so
 base a motive as a desire to secure the hand of the princess, and the 
honour of being the king's son-in-law?<i>" </i>Could any thing have been
 ruder and more haughty than such a speech? And yet, O see what 
evangelical refinements have done for us! We, who are infinitely less 
before God than David was before King Saul;-we, worms of a day, are so 
blinded by prejudice, as to think it beneath us to mind the offers of 
the King of kings, or to strive for the rewards of the Lord of lords.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Woe to him that striveth [in generosity] with his
 Maker! Let the potsherds strive thus with the potsherds of the earth: 
[but let not] the clay say to him that fashioneth it," "What doest thou 
when thou stirrest me up to good works by the promise of thy rewards? 
Surely, Lord, thou forgettest that the nobleness of my mind, and my 
doctrine of finished salvation, make me above running for a reward, 
though it should be for a life of glory, and thyself. Whatever I do at 
thy command, I am determined not to demean myself; I will do it as 
Araunah, like a king." What depths of Antinomian pride may be hid under 
the covering of our voluntary humility!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">8. The Calvinists of the last century, in their 
lucid intervals, saw the absolute necessity of working for heaven and 
heavenly rewards. We have a good practical discourse of J. Bunyan upon 
these words, "so run that you may obtain." The burden of it is, "If you 
will have a heaven, you must run for it." Whence he calls his sermon, "<i>The heavenly footman;</i>" and Matthew Mead,-- a staunch Calvinist, in his treatise on <i>The Good of Early Obedience, </i>(p.
 429,) says, with great truth, "Maintain a holy, filial fear of God. 
This is an excellent preservative against apostasy. 'By the fear of the 
Lord men depart from evil,' says Solomon, and he tells you, 'The fear of
 the Lord is the fountain of life, whereby men depart from the snares of
 death;' and backsliding from Christ is one of the great snares of 
death. Think much of the day of recompense, and of the glorious reward 
of perseverance in that day:  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">'Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee
 a crown of life.' It is not those that begin well, but those who end 
well, that receive the crown. It is not mercenary service to quicken 
ourselves to obedience by the hope of a recompense. <i>Omnis arnor mercedis non est inercenarius, Isc. </i>David
 said, 'I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.' He 
encouraged himself to duty by the hope of glory, &amp;c. Hope of that 
glorious recompense is of great service to quicken us to perseverance. 
And to the same end does the apostle urge it: 'Be unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour
 is not in vain in the Lord.'"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* As a proof of his being sound in the doctrines 
of Calvinistic grace and confusion, I present the reader with the 
following passage, taken from the same book, printed in London, 1683, 
(p. 307:) "A believer is under the law for conduct, but not for 
judgment, &amp;c. It is the guide of his path, but not the judge of his 
state. The believer is bound to obey it, but not to stand or fall by 
it." That is, in plain English, he should obey it, but his disobedience 
will never bring him under condemnation, and hinder him to stand in 
judgment. "It is a rule of life, &amp;c, and therefore it obliges 
believers as much as others, though upon other motives, &amp;c: for they
 are not to expect life or favour from it, nor fear the death and rigour
 that comes by it. The law has no power to justify a believer, or 
condemn him, and therefore can be no rule to try his state by." In flat 
opposition to the general tenor of the Scriptures, thus, summed up by 
St. John: "In this," namely, committing or not committing sin, "the 
children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil." What this 
author says is true, if it be understood of the Adamic law of innocence;
 but if it be extended to St. Paul's law of Christ, and to St. James' 
law of liberty, it is one of the dangerous tenets that support the chair
 of the Antinomian "man of sin."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">9. When voluntary humility has made us wise above 
what is written by the apostles and by our forefathers, it will make us 
look down with contempt from the top of our fancied orthodoxy, upon the 
motives by which the prophets took up their cross, to serve God and 
their generation. When St. Paul enumerates the works of Moses, he traces
 them back to their noble principle, faith working by a well ordered 
self love: (a love this which is inseparable from the love of God and 
man; the law of liberty binding us to love our neighbour <i>as ourselves, </i>and God <i>above ourselves.) </i>"He
 chose," says the apostle, "to suffer affliction with the people of God,
 rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin," &amp;c. But why? Because he
 was above looking at the prize? Just the reverse: Because 'He had 
respect to the recompense of reward," Heb. xi, 26.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">10. In the next chapter the apostle bids us to 
take Christ himself for our pattern in the very thing which our Gospel 
refiners call mercenary and base: "Looking to Jesus," says he, "who, for
 the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the 
shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." The 
noble reward this, with which his mediatorial obedience was crowned, as 
appears from these words: "He became obedient unto death; wherefore God 
also hath highly exalted him." If the scheme of those who refine the 
ancient Gospel appears to me in a peculiarly unfavourable light, it is 
when I see them impose upon the injudicious admirers of unscriptural 
humility, and make the simple believe that they do God service when they
 indirectly represent Christ's obedience unto death as imperfect, and 
him as mercenary, actuated by a motive unworthy of a child of God. He 
says, "Every one that is perfect shall be as his master:<i>" </i>but we 
(such is our consistency!) loudly decry perfection, and yet pretend to a
 higher degree of it than our Lord and Master; for he was not above 
"enduring the cross [for the joy of] sitting down at the, right hand of 
the throne of God:"<i> </i>but we are so exquisitely perfect, that we will work <i>gratis. </i>It is mercenary, it is beneath us to work for glory!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">11. I fear this contempt is by some indirectly 
poured upon the Lord of glory, to extol the spurious free grace which is
 sister to free wrath; and to persuade the simple that "works have 
nothing to do with our final justification and eternal salvation before 
God." A dogma this, which is as contrary to reason as it is to Scripture
 and morality; it being a monstrous imposition upon the credulity of 
Protestants to assert that works, which God himself will reward with 
final justification and eternal salvation, have nothing to do with that 
justification and that salvation before him: just as if the thing 
rewarded had nothing to do with its reward before the rewarder!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">12. The most rigid Calvinists allow that St. Paul 
is truly evangelical: but which of the sacred writers ever spoke greater
 things of the rewardableness of works than he? What can be plainer, 
what stronger than these words, which I must quote till they are minded:
 "Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, &amp;c, knowing 
[i.e. considering] that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the 
inheritance. But he that doth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which 
he hath done; for there is no respect of persons," Col. iii, 23, &amp;c.
 Again:  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap:
 for he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap perdition; but
 he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap everlasting 
life," Gal. vi. 7, 8.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">From those scriptures it is evident that doing good or bad works <i>is </i>like sowing good or bad seed; and that going to heaven or hell is like gathering what we have sown. Now, as it is the <i>madness </i>of unbelievers to sow wickedness, and to expect a crop of happiness and glory; so it is the <i>wisdom </i>of
 believers to sow righteousness, expecting to "reap in due time if they 
faint not." Nor do we act reasonably, if we do not sow more or less with
 an eye to reaping: for if reaping be quite out of the question with 
Protestants, they may as wisely sow chaff on a fallow, as corn in a 
ploughed field. Hence I conclude that a believer may obey, and that, if 
he be judicious, he will obey, looking both to Jesus and to the rewards 
of obedience; and that the more we can fix the eye of his faith upon his
 "exceeding great reward, and his great recompense of reward," the more 
he will "abound in the work of faith, the patience of hope, and the 
labour of love."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">13. St. Paul's conduct with respect to rewards was
 perfectly consistent with his doctrine. I have already observed, he 
wrote to the Corinthians, that he so "ran and so fought as to obtain an 
incorruptible crown;" and it is well known that in the Olympic games, to
 which he alludes, all ran or fought with an eye to a prize, a reward, 
or a crown. But in his Epistle to the Philippians he goes still farther;
 for he represents his running for a crown of life, his pressing after 
rewards of grace and glory, as the whole of his business. His words are 
remarkable: "This one thing I do; forgetting those things which are 
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press 
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ 
Jesus." And when he had just run his race out, he wrote to Timothy, "I 
have finished my course; henceforth there is laid up for me [as for a 
conqueror] a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous 
Judge, shall give me at that day"-the great day of retribution. As for 
St. John, when he was perfected in love, we find him as "mercenary" as 
St. Paul; for he writes to the elect lady, and to her believing 
children:, "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we 
have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">14. When I read such scriptures, I wonder at those
 who are so wrapt up in the pernicious notion that we ought not to work*
 for a life of glory, as to overlook even the "crown of life," with 
which God will reward those who are "faithful unto death." And I am 
astonished at the remains of my own unbelief, which prevent my being 
always ravished with admiration at the thought of the rewards offered to
 fire my soul into seraphic obedience. Au idle country fellow, who runs 
at the wakes for a wretched prize, labours harder in his sportive race 
than, I fear, I do yet in some of my prayers and sermons. A sportsman, 
for the pitiful honour of coming in at the death of a fox, toils more 
than most professors do in the pursuit of their corruptions. How ought 
confusion to cover our faces! Let those that refine the Gospel glory in 
their shame. Let each of them say, "I thank thee, O God, that I am not 
like a Papist, or like that Arminian, who looks at the rewards which 
thou hast promised. I deny myself, and take up my cross, without 
thinking of the joy and rewards set before me," &amp;c. For my part, I 
desire to humble myself before God, for having so long overlooked the 
"exceeding great reward," and the "crown of life," promised to them that
 obey him and my thoughts shall be expressed in such words as these:- 
"Gracious Lord, if 'he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet
 shall have a prophet's reward;' if 'our light affliction,' when it is 
patiently endured, 'worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal 
weight of glory:' if thou hast said, 'Do good and lend, hoping for 
nothing again [from man,] and your reward shall be great, and ye shall 
be the children of the Highest:' if thou animatest those who are 
persecuted for righteousness' sake, by this promissory exhortation, 
'Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven:' 
nay, if a cup of cold water only, given in thy name, 'shall in no wise 
lose its reward;' and if the least of thy rewards is a smile of 
approbation; let me be ready to go round the world, shouldst thou call 
me to it, that I may obtain such a recompense.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* Truth is so great that it sometimes prevails 
over those that are prejudiced against it. I have observed that Dr. 
Crisp himself, in a happy moment, bore a noble testimony to undefiled 
religion. Take another instance of it. In the volume of the Rev. Mr. 
Whitefield's sermons, taken in short hand, and published by Gurney, (p. 
119,) that great preacher says: "FIRST, we must work FOR Spiritual life 
AFTERWARD FROM it." And (pages 153, 154) he declares: "There are numbers
 of poor that are ready to perish; and if you drop something to them in 
love, God will take care to repay you when you come to judgment." I find
 but one fault with this doctrine. The first of those propositions does 
not guard free grace so well as Mr. Wesley's Minutes do. We should 
always intimate that there is no working FOR a life of glory, or FOR a 
MORE ABUNDANT LIFE of grace, but FROM an initial life of grace, FREELY 
given to us in Christ BEFORE any working of our own. This I mention, not
 to prejudice the reader against Mr. Whitefield, but to show that I am 
not so prejudiced in favour of works, as not to see when even a 
Whitefield, in an unguarded expression, leans toward them to the 
disparagement of free grace.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Since thou hast so closely connected holiness and happiness, my duty and thy favours, 'let no man beguile <i>me </i>of <i>my </i>reward
 in a voluntary humility,' nor suffer me to be 'carried about with every
 wind of doctrine by the sleight of men,' and 'cunning craftiness, 
whereby they lie in wait to deceive.' And I whatsoever my hand findeth 
to do, help me to do it with all my might;' not only lest I lose my 
reward, but also lest I have not 'a full reward;' lest I lose a beam of 
the light of thy countenance, or a degree of that peculiar likeness and 
nearness to thee with which thou wilt recompense those who excel in 
virtue. So shall I equally avoid the delusion of the Pharisees, who 
expect heaven through their faithless works; and the error of 
Antinomians, who hope to enter into thy glory without the passport of 
the works of faith.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"And now, Lord, if thy servant has found favour in
 thy sight, permit him to urge another request; so far as thy wisdom, 
and the laws by which thy free grace works upon free agents will permit,
 incline the minds of Papists and Protestants to receive the truth as it
 is in Jesus. Let not especially this plain testimony, borne to the many
 great promises which thou hast made, and to the astonishing rewards 
which thou, offerest them that work righteousness, be rejected by my 
Calvinist brethren. Keep them from fighting against thy goodness, and 
despising their own mercies, under pretence of fighting against 
'Arminian errors,' and despising 'Pelagian Checks to the Gospel.' And 
make them sensible that it is absurd to decry in word the pope's 
pretensions to infallibility, if by an obstinate refusal to 'review the 
whole affair,' and to weigh their supposed orthodoxy in the balances of 
reason and revelation, they in fact pretend to be infallible themselves;
 and thus, instead of one Catholic pontiff, set up ten thousand 
Protestant popes.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Thou knowest, Lord, that many of them love thee; 
and that, though they disgrace thy Gospel by their doctrinal 
peculiarities, they adorn it by their godly conversation. O endue them 
with more love to their remonstrant brethren! Give them and me that 
charity which 'behaveth not itself unseemly,' which 'rejoiceth not in' a
 favourite error, 'but rejoiceth in the truth,' even when it is advanced
 by our opponents. Thou seest, that if they decry true holiness and good
 works as 'dung and dross,' it is chiefly for fear thy glory should be 
obscured by our obedience. Error transformed into an angel of light has 
deceived them, and they think to do thee service by propagating the 
deception. O gracious God, pardon them this wrong. They 'do it 
ignorantly in unbelief;' therefore seal not up their mistake with the 
seal of thy wrath. Let them yet 'know the truth,' and let the truth 
enlarge their hearts, and 'make them free' from the notion that thou art
 not 'loving to every man' during 'the day of salvation,' and that there
 is neither mercy nor Saviour for the most of their neighbours, even 
during 'the accepted time.'  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Above all, Lord, if they cannot defend their 
mistakes, either by argument or by Scripture quoted according to the 
context, and the obvious tenor of thy sacred oracles, give them more 
wisdom than to expose any longer the Protestant religion, which they 
think to defend; and more piety than to make the men of the world abhor 
thy Gospel, and blaspheme thy name, as free thinkers are daily tempted 
to do, when they see that those who pretend to 'exalt thee' most, are of
 all Protestants the most ready to disarm thy Gospel of its sanctions; 
to turn thy judicial sentences into frivolous descriptions; to overlook 
the dictates of reason and good nature; and to make the press groan 
under illogical assertions, and personal abuse!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Let thy servant speak once more: thou knowest, O 
Lord, that thy power being my helper, I would choose to die rather than 
willfully to depreciate that grace, that free grace of thine which has 
so long kept me out of hell, and daily gives me sweet foretastes of 
heaven. And now, let not readers of a Pharisaic turn mistake what I have
 advanced in honour of the works of faith, and by that mean build 
themselves up in their self-righteous delusion, and destructive contempt
 of thy merits: help them to consider, that if our works are rewardable,
 it is because thy free grace makes them so; thy Father having 
mercifully accepted our persons for thy sake, thy Holy Spirit having 
gently helped our infirmities, thy precious blood having fully atoned 
for our sins and imperfections, thy incessant intercession still keeping
 the way to the throne of grace open for us, and our poor performances. 
Suffer not one of the sons of virtuous pride, into whose hands these 
sheets may fall, to forget that thou hast annexed 'the reward of the 
inheritance' to the assemblage of the works of faith, or to 'patient 
continuance in well doing,' and not to one or two splendid works of 
hypocrisy done just to serve a wordly turn, or to bribe a disturbed, 
clamorous conscience; and enable them so to feel the need of thy pardon 
for past transgression, and of thy power for future obedience, that, as 
the chased hart panteth after the water brooks, so their awakened souls 
may long after Christ, in whom the penitent find inexhaustible springs 
of righteousness and strength; and to whom, "with thee and thy eternal 
Spirit, be for ever ascribed praise, honour, and glory, both in heaven 
and upon earth-praise for the wonders of general redemption, and for the
 innumerable displays of thy free grace unstained by free wrath<i>-honour </i>for
 bestowing the gracious reward of a heavenly salvation upon all 
believers that make their election sure 'by patient continuance in well 
doing'-and <i>glory </i>for inflicting the just punishment of infernal 
damnation upon all that neglect so great salvation, and to the end of 
the accepted time dare thy vengeance by obstinate continuance in ill 
doing."  </font>

<p><font size="4">MADELEY, <i>March </i>10, 1774.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">YESTERDAY a friend lent me Mr. Baxter's <i>Confession of Faith, </i>printed
 in London, 1655. The third part of this valuable book extends through 
above one hundred and forty large pages, and the title of that long 
section runs thus:-"The Testimony of Reformed Divines, ascribing as much
 to Works as I; and many of them delivering the same Doctrine." He 
produces a hundred witnesses, some of whom are collective bodies, such 
as the assembly of divines, the compilers of the homilies of the Church 
of England, and even the synod of Dort. As the Antinomian spirit which 
flamed against Baxter's Works in the last century will probably sparkle 
against the preceding Essay, I beg leave to take shelter behind that 
great man, and a few of his numerous quotations. I shall cite only 
Baxter's page, to which I refer those who desire to see the original of 
his Latin quotations, together with the books, chapters, and pages of 
the various authors.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 322, he quotes the following words from 
Bishop Davenant:- "As no man receiveth that general justification which 
dischargeth from the guilt of all foregoing sins, but on the concurrence
 of repentance, faith, a purpose of a new life, and other actions of the
 same kind; so no man retaineth a state free from guilt in respect of 
following sins, but by means of the same actions of believing in God, 
calling on God, mortifying the flesh, daily repenting and sorrowing for 
sins daily committed. The reason why all these are required on our part 
is this; because these cannot be still absent, but their opposites will 
be present, which are contrary to the nature of a justified man. As 
therefore to the conservation of natural life it is necessarily required
 that a man carefully avoid fire, water, precipices, poisons, and other 
things destructive to the health of the body; so to the conserving of 
spiritual life, it is necessarily required that a man avoid incredulity,
 impenitency, and other things that are destructive and contrary to the 
salvation of souls; which cannot be avoided, unless the opposite and 
contrary actions be exercised. And these actions do not conserve the 
life of grace properly and of themselves, by touching the very effect of
 conservation; but improperly and by accident, by excluding and removing
 the cause of destruction."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 324, Baxter produces these words of the same 
pious bishop:- "We do therefore fight against, not the bare name of 
merit, in a harmless sense frequently used of old by the fathers, but 
the proud and false opinion of merit of condignity, brought lately by 
the Papists into the Church of God."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">And again, (page 325,) "The works of the 
regenerate have an ordination to the rewards of this life and that to 
come: (1.) Because God hath freely promised (according to the good 
pleasure of his will) the rewards of this life and that to come, to the 
good works of the faithful and regenerate," I Tim. iv, 8; Gal. vi, 8; 
Matt. xx, 8.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 328, he quotes the following passage from Dr.
 Twiss:-"It lieth on all the elect to seek salvation, not only by faith,
 but by works also, in that without doubt salvation is to be given by 
way of reward, whereby God will reward not only our faith, but also all 
our good works."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Pages 330 and 334, he quotes Melancthon thus:-"New
 obedience is necessary by necessity of order of the cause and effect; 
also by necessity of duty or command; also by necessity of retaining 
faith, and avoiding punishments, temporal and eternal. Cordatus stirreth
 up against me the city, and also the neighbour countries, and also the 
court itself, because, in explaining the controversy of justification, I
 said that new obedience is necessary to salvation."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Pages 360, 361, he quotes these words of Zarichius:-"Works are necessary, (1.) To justify our faith <i>[coram Deo] </i>before
 God, &amp;c. (2.) They are necessary to the obtaining eternal life, 
&amp;c. (3.) They are necessary to inherit justification as causes, 
&amp;c. (4.) They are profitable to conserve the increase of faith; also
 to pro[ gap]-merit of God, and obtain many good things, both spiritual 
and corporal, both in this life and in another." The words of Zanchius 
are, "<i>Opera utilia suni, &amp;c, </i>ad <i>multa bona turn spiritualia turn corporalia, turn in hac vita turn in alia a Beo promerenda et obLnenda." </i>(Zanch. Tom. 8, p. 787, bc. <i>de .11181. Fidsi.) </i>How
 much more tenderly did Mr. Wesley speak of merit than the orthodox 
Zanchius, whom Mr. Toplady has lately rendered famous among us! I hope 
that if this gentleman ever open his favourite book to the above-quoted 
page, he will drop his prejudices, and confess that his dear Zanchius 
himself nobly contends for the Wesleyan "heresy."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 462, Baxter concludes his book by praying for
 those who had misrepresented him to the world, and obliged him to spend
 so much time in vindicating his doctrine. I most heartily join him in 
the last paragraph of his prayer, in which I beg the reader would join 
us both:  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"The Lord illuminate and send forth some messenger that may acquaint the Churches with that <i>true, middle, reconciling method of theological verities which must be the mean of healing our divisions. </i>Let
 men be raised of greater sufficiency for this work, and of such blessed
 accomplishments as shall be fit to cope with the power of prejudice; 
and let the fury of blind contradiction be so calmed that TRUTH may have
 opportunity to do its work." </font><font size="5"> </font>

</p><p><font size="4">MY LADY,-BECAUSE I think it my duty to defend the 
works of faith against the triumphant errors of the Solifidians, some of
 your ladyship's friends conclude that I am an enemy to the doctrine of 
salvation by faith, and their conclusion amounts to such exclamations as
 these:  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"How could a lady, so zealous for God's glory and 
the Redeemer's grace, commit the superintendency of a seminary of pious 
learning to a man that opposes the fundamental doctrine of 
Protestantism! How could she put her sheep under the care of such a wolf
 in sheep's clothing!" This conclusion, my lady, has grieved me for your
 sake; and to remove the blot that it indirectly fixes upon you, as well
 as to balance my <i>Scriptural Essay on the Rewardableness of the Works of Faith, </i>I publish, and humbly dedicate to your ladyship, this piece of my <i>Equal Check to Pharisaism and Antinomianism. </i>May
 the kindness which enabled you to bear for years with the coarseness of
 my ministrations, incline you favourably to receive this little token 
of my unfeigned attachment to Protestantism, and of my lasting respect 
for your ladyship!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Your aversion to all that looks like controversy-can never make you think that an <i>Equal Check </i>to
 the two grand delusions, which have crept into the Church, is needless 
in our days. I flatter myself, therefore, that though you may blame my 
performance, you will approve of my design. And indeed what true 
Christian can be absolutely neutral in this controversy? If God has a 
controversy with all Pharisees and Antinomians, have not all God's 
children a controversy with Pharisaism and Antinomianism? Have you not 
for one, my lady? Do you not check in private, what I attempt to check 
in public? Does not the religious world know that you abhor, attack, and
 pursue Pharisaism in its most artful disguises? And have I not 
frequently heard you express, in the strongest terms, your detestation 
of Antinomianism, and lament the number of sleeping professors whom that
 Delilah robs of their strength? Nor would you, I am persuaded, my lady,
 have countenanced the opposition which was made against the Minutes, if
 your commendable, though (as it appears to me) at that time too 
precipitate zeal against Pharisaism had not prevented your seeing that 
they contain the Scripture truths which are most fit to stop the rapid 
progress of Antinomianism.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">However, if you still think, my lady, that I 
mistake with respect to the importance of those propositions; you know I
 am not mistaken when I declare before the world that a powerful, 
practical, actually saving faith is the only faith I ever heard your 
ladyship recommend as worthy to be contended for. And so long as you 
plead only for such a faith: so long as you abhor the winter faith that 
saves the Solifidians in their own conceit: while they commit adultery, 
murder, and incest, if they choose to carry Antinomianism to such a 
dreadful length; so long as you are afraid to maintain either directly 
or indirectly, that the evidence and comfort of justifying faith may 
indeed be suspended by sin; but that the righteousness of faith, and the
 justification which it instrumentally procures, can never be lost, no 
not by the most enormous and complicated crimes; whatever diversity 
there may be between your ladyship's sentiments and mine, it can never 
be fundamental. I preach salvation by a faith that actually works by 
obedient love: and your ladyship witnesses salvation by an actually 
operative faith. Nor can I, to this day, see any material difference 
between those phrases: for if I profess a faith that is actually 
operative, I cannot with propriety find fault with a faith that actually
 operates: I cannot with decency sacrifice its works to "Antinomian 
dotages*."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Permit me also to observe, that the grand 
questions debated between my opponents and me are not (as I fear your 
ladyship apprehends) whether Pharisaic merit shall eclipse the 
Redeemer's worthiness; or whether the doctrine of salvation by a lively 
faith shall be given up to mere moralists. I no more plead either for 
the one or for the other, than I do for placing the pretender upon the 
British throne. and for sacrificing the great charter to arbitrary 
power. No, my lady. What we contend about is: (1.) Whether Christ's law 
is not perfectly consistent with his blood. (2.) Whether we are to set 
him at naught as a Prophet, a King, and a Judge, under pretence of 
exalting him as a Priest, an Advocate, and a "Surety of the better 
covenant," that threatens fallen believers with a "sorer punishment" 
than that which was inflicted upon the despisers of the Mosaic covenant.
 (3.) Whether the evangelical worthiness, which a true believer really 
derives from Christ, is not absolutely necessary to salvation. (4.) 
Whether such a worthiness is not as consistent with Christ's original 
and paramount merit, as the light that shines in your apartment is 
consistent with the original and transcendent brightness of the sun. 
(5.) Whether that faith is living, which evidences itself by gross 
immoralities. (6.) Whether it is not rather the "dead faith" that St. 
James exclaims against. And (7.) Whether the Solifidians do not set up 
the "abomination of desolation in the holy place," when they directly or
 <i>indirectly </i>teach that all believers may go any length in sin, 
without losing their heavenly thrones, or the Divine favour: that a man 
may have the justifying, saving, operative faith which your ladyship 
pleads for, while he adds idolatry to incontinence, murder to adultery, 
and curses to the repeated denial of Jesus Christ: that fallen 
believers, who have returned to their sins "as a sow that is washed does
 to her wallowing in the mire," stand immaculate before God in a robe of
 imputed righteousness, even while they "turn God's grace into 
lasciviousness, and commit all uncleanness with greediness:" that they 
shall all infallibly sing in heaven in consequence of their most 
grievous falls on earth; and that a kind of hypocritical, lying free 
grace is to be preached to all sinners, which necessarily shuts up most 
'of them under the absolute free wrath' of a God ever merciless toward 
the majority of mankind.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* The name which Flavel gives to Dr. Crisp's modish tenets.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">**Mr. Hill has done it "directly" in the fourth of
 the Five Letters which he had inscribed to me, and all the Solifidians 
do it "indirectly."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Now, my lady, as I am persuaded that you do not 
admire such an immoral and narrow Gospel: as I believe that if at any 
time it creeps into your chapels, it is without your approbation, under 
the mask of decency, and only by the means of the specious phrases of <i>grace Gospel, electing, everlasting love, finished salvation, </i>and <i>free distinguishing grace, </i>which, according to the analogy of the modish faith, <i>sweetly </i>make way for the inseparable and bitter doctrines of a <i>conjoined Gospel </i>of <i>everlasting hate, reprobating unmercifulness, finished damnation, </i>and <i>free, distinguishing wrath; </i>and
 as I do your ladyship the justice to acknowledge, that your most 
earnest desire is to support what appears to you a free and holy Gospel,
 at the expense of your fortune, life, and character; I beg, my lady, 
you will also do me the justice to believe that if I oppose the 
Solifidian Gospel of the day, it is only because it appears to me a 
confined and unholy Gospel, calculated to foster the Antinomianism of 
Laodicean believers, and to render Christ's undefiled religion <i>contemptable </i>to the RATIONAL, and <i>execrable </i>to
 the MORAL world. If you grant me this request, I shall only trouble you
 with one more, which is, to believe that, notwithstanding the part I 
have taken in the present controversy, I remain, with my former respect 
and devotedness, my lady, your ladyship's most obliged and obedient 
servant in the Gospel,  </font>

</p><p align="center"><font size="4">AN ESSAY ON TRUTH, &amp;c.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">INTRODUCTION.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">EXCEEDINGLY sorry should I be if the testimony which I have borne to the necessity <i>of good </i>works caused any of my readers to do the worst <i>of bad </i>works, that is, to neglect <i>believing, </i>and to depend upon some of the external, <i>faithless </i>performances
 which conceited Pharisees call "good works;" and by which they absurdly
 think to make amends for their sins, to purchase the Divine favour, to 
set aside God's mercy, and to supersede Christ's atoning blood. 
Therefore, lest some unwary souls, going from one extreme to the other, 
should so unfortunately avoid Antinomianism as to run upon the rocks 
which are rendered famous by the destruction of the Pharisees, I shall 
once more vindicate the fundamental anti-Pharisaic doctrine of salvation
 by faith: I say <i>once more, </i>because I have already done it in my 
guarded sermon. And to the scriptures, articles, and arguments produced 
in that piece, I shall now add rational and yet Scriptural observations,
 which, together with appeals to matter of fact, will, I hope, soften 
the prejudices of judicious moralists against the doctrine of faith, and
 reconcile considerate Solifidians to the doctrine of works. In order to
 this, I design in general to prove that true faith is the only plant 
which can possibly bear good works; that it loses its operative nature, 
and dies, when it produces them not; and that it as much surpasses good 
works in importance, as the motion of the heart does all other bodily 
motions. Inquire we first into the nature and ground of saving faith.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION I. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>A plain definition of saving faith, how believing is the gift of God, and whether it is in our power to believe.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">WHAT IS faith? It is <i>believing heartily. </i>What
 is saving faith? I dare not say that it is "believing heartily, my sins
 are forgiven me for Christ's sake;" for if I live in sin, that belief 
is a destructive conceit, and not saving faith. Neither dare I say that 
"saving faith is only a sure trust and confidence that Christ loved me, 
and gave himself for me;"* for, if I did, I should damn almost all 
mankind for four thousand years. Such definitions of saving faith are, I
 fear, too narrow to be just, and too unguarded to keep out 
Solifidianism. A comparison may convince my readers of it. If they 
desired me to define man, and I said, "Man is a rational animal that 
lives in France in the year 1774;" would they not ask me whether I 
suppose all the rational animals that lived on this side the English 
channel in 1773 were brutes? And if you desired to know what I mean by 
saving faith, and I replied, It is a supernatural belief that Christ has
 actually atoned for my sins upon the cross: would you not ask me 
whether Abraham, the father of the faithful, who would have believed a 
lie if he had believed this, had only damning faith?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* When the Church of England and Mr. Wesley give 
us particular definitions of faith, it is plain that they consider it 
according to the Christian dispensation; the privileges of which must be
 principally insisted upon among Christians; and that our Church and Mr.
 Wesley guard faith against Antinomianism, is evident from their 
maintaining, as well as St. Paul, that by bad works we lose a good 
conscience, and "make shipwreck of the faith."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To avoid therefore such mistakes; to contradict no
 scriptures; to put no black mark of damnation upon any man, that in any
 nation "fears God and works righteousness;" to leave no room for 
Solifidianism; and to present the reader with a definition of faith 
adequate to "the everlasting Gospel," I would choose to say, that 
"justifying or saving faith is believing the saving truth with the heart
 unto internal, and [as we have opportunity] unto external 
righteousness, according to our light and dispensation." To St. Paul's 
words, Rom. x, 10, I add the epithets internal and external, in order to
 exclude, according to 1 John iii, 7, 8, the filthy imputation under 
which fallen believers may, if we credit the Antinomians, commit 
internal and external adultery, mental and bodily murder, without the 
least reasonable fear of endangering their faith, their interest in 
God's favour, and their inamissible title to a throne of glory.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But "how is faith the gift of God?" Some persons 
think that faith is as much out of our power as the lightning that 
shoots from a distant cloud; they suppose that God drives sinners to the
 fountain of Christ's blood as irresistibly as the infernal legion drove
 the herd of swine into the sea of Galilee; and that a man is as passive
 in the first act of faith, as Jonah was in the act of the fish, which 
cast him upon the shore. Hence the absurd plea of many who lay fast hold
 on the horns of the devil's altar, unbelief, and cry out, "We can no 
more believe than we can make a world."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I call this an <i>absurd </i>plea for several 
reasons: (1.) It supposes that when "God commands all men every where to
 repent and to believe the Gospel," he commands them to do what is as 
impossible to them as the making of a new world. (2.) It supposes that 
the terms of the covenant of grace are much harder than the terms of the
 covenant of works. For the old covenant required only perfect human 
obedience: but the new covenant requires of us the work of an almighty 
God, i.e. believing; a work this which, upon the scheme I oppose, is as 
impossible to us as the creation of a world, in which we can never have a
 hand. (3.) It supposes that the promise of salvation being suspended 
upon believing, a thing as impracticable to us as the making of a new 
world, we shall as infallibly be damned if God do not believe for us, as
 we should be if we were required to make a world on pain of damnation, 
and God would not make it in our place. (4.) It supposes that believing 
is a work which belongs to God alone: for no man in his senses can doubt
 but creating a world, or its tantamount, believing, is a work which 
none but God can manage. (5.) It supposes that (if he, who <i>believeth not the Divine record, makes God a liar, and shall be damned,) </i>whenever
 unbelievers are called upon to believe, and God refuses them the power 
to do it, he as much forces them to make him a liar and to be damned, as
 the king would force me to give him the lie, and to be hanged, if he 
put me in circumstances where I could have no chance of avoiding that 
crime and punishment, but by submitting to the alternative of creating a
 world. (6.) It supposes that when Christ "marvelled at the unbelief of 
the Jews," he showed as little wisdom as I should were I to marvel at a 
man for not creating three worlds as quickly as a believer can say the 
three creeds. (7.) That when Christ reproved his disciples for their 
unbelief he acted more unreasonably than if he had rebuked them for not 
adding a new star to every constellation in heaven. (8.) That to exhort 
people to [abide] in the faith," is to exhort them to something as 
difficult as to continue creating worlds. And, lastly, that when Christ 
fixes our damnation upon unbelief, see Mark xvi, 16, and John iii, 18, 
he acts far more tyrannically than the king would do if he issued out a 
proclamation informing all his subjects that whosoever shall not, by 
such a time, raise a new island within the British seas, shall be 
infallibly put to the most painful and lingering death.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Having thus exposed the erroneous sense in which 
some people suppose that "faith is the gift of God," I beg leave to 
mention in what sense it appears to me to be so. Believing is the gift 
of God's grace, as cultivating the root of a rare flower given you, or 
raising a crop of corn in your field, is the gift of God's providence. 
Believing is the gift of the God of grace, as breathing, moving, and 
eating, are the gifts of the God of nature. He gives me lungs and air 
that I may breathe: he gives me life and muscles that I may move: he 
bestows upon me food, and a mouth, that I may eat: and when I have no 
stomach, he gives me common sense to see I must die, or force myself to 
take some nourishment or some medicine. But he neither breathes, moves, 
nor eats for me; nay, when I think proper, I can accelerate my 
breathing, motion, and eating; and if I please I may even fast, lie 
down, or hang myself, and by that mean put an end to my eating, moving, 
and breathing. Once more: faith is the gift of God to believers, as 
sight is to you. The Parent of good freely gives you the light of the 
sun, and organs proper to receive it: he places you in a world where 
that light visits you daily: he apprizes you that sight is conducive to 
your safety, pleasure, and profit; and every thing around you bids you 
use your eyes and see: nevertheless, you may not only drop your 
curtains, and extinguish your candle, but close your eyes also. This is 
exactly the case with regard to faith. Free grace removes (in part) the 
total blindness which Adam's fall brought upon us: free grace gently 
sends us some beams of truth, which is the light of the "Sun of 
righteousness;" it disposes the eyes of our understanding to see those 
beams; it excite us various ways to welcome them; it blesses us with 
many, perhaps with all the means of faith, such as opportunities to 
hear, read, inquire; and power to consider, assent, consent, resolve, 
and re-resolve to believe the truth. But, after all, believing is as 
much our own act as seeing. We may, nay, in general do suspend, or omit 
the act of faith; especially when that act is not yet become habitual, 
and when the glaring light that sometimes accompanies the revelation of 
the truth is abated. Nay, we may imitate Pharaoh, Judas, and all 
reprobates; we may do by the eye of our faith what some report that 
Democritus did by his bodily eyes. Being tired of seeing the follies of 
mankind, to rid himself of that disagreeable sight he put his eyes out. 
We may be so averse from "the light which enlightens every man that 
comes into the world;" we may so dread it because our works are evil, as
 to exemplify, like the Pharisees, such awful declarations as 
these:-"Their eyes have they closed, lest they should see, &amp;c: 
wherefore God gave them up to a reprobate mind," and "they were 
blinded."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">When St. Paul says that Christians "believe 
according to the working of God's mighty power, which he wrought in 
Christ when he raised him from the dead," he chiefly alludes to the 
resurrection of Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost; the former
 of these wonders being the great ground and object of the Christian 
faith, and the latter displaying the great privilege of the Christian 
dispensation. To suppose, therefore, that nobody savingly believes, who 
does not believe according to an actual, overwhelming display of God's 
almighty power, is as unscriptural as to maintain that God's people no 
longer believe, than he actually repeats the wonders of Easter day, and 
on the day of pentecost. Is it not clear that the apostle had no such 
notions when he wrote to the Corinthians? "I declare unto you the 
Gospel, which I preached unto you, which you have received; wherein ye 
stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory [if ye hold 
fast, as the original means] what I preached unto you, unless ye have 
believed in vain. For I declared unto you, &amp;c, that Christ died for 
our sins, that he was buried, and that he rose again, according to the 
Scriptures, &amp;c, so we preach, and so ye believed." Again: how plain 
is the account that our Lord and his forerunner give us of faith and 
unbelief! "Verily we speak what we do know, and testify what we have 
seen, and ye receive not our witness. What he [Christ] hath seen and 
heard, that he testifieth, and no man [comparatively] receiveth his 
testimony; but he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal 
that God is true."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Two things have chiefly given room to our mistakes
 respecting the strange impossibility of believing. The first is our 
confounding the truths which characterize the several Gospel 
dispensations. We see, for example, that a poor, besotted drunkard, an 
overreaching, greedy tradesman, a rich, skeptical epicure, and a proud, 
ambitious courtier, have no more taste for "the Gospel of Christ," than a
 horse and a mule have for the high-seasoned dishes that crown a royal 
table. An immense gulf is fixed between them and the Christian faith. In
 their present state they can no more believe "with their heart unto 
righteousness in Christ," than an unborn infant can become a man without
 passing through infancy and youth. But, although they cannot yet 
believe savingly in Christ, may they not believe in God according to the
 import of our Lord's words: "Ye believe IN GOD, believe also IN ME?" If
 the Pharisees could not believe in Christ, it was not because God never
 gave them a power equal to that which created the world; but because 
they were practical Atheists, who actually rejected the morning light of
 the Jewish dispensation, and by that mean absolutely unfitted 
themselves for the meridian light of the Christian dispensation. This is
 evident from our Lord's own words: "I know you, that ye have not the 
love of God [or a regard for God] in you. I come in my Father's name, 
and ye receive me not, [though ye might do it; for] if another shall 
come in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye believe, who 
receive honour one of another? &amp;c. There is one that accuseth you, 
even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, [and submitted 
to his dispensation,] ye would have believed me, [and submitted to] my 
Gospel. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my 
words?<i>"</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The second cause of our mistake about the 
impossibility of believing now, is, the confounding of faith with its 
fruits and rewards; which naturally leads us to think that we cannot 
believe, or that our faith is vain, till those rewards and fruits 
appear. But is not this being ingenious to make the worst of things? Had
 Abraham no faith in God's promise till Isaac was born? Was Sarah a 
damnable unbeliever till she felt the long-expected fruit of her womb 
stir there? Had the woman of Canaan no faith till our Lord granted her 
request, and cried out "O woman, great is thy faith, let it be done unto
 thee even as thou wilt?<i>" </i>Was the centurion an infidel till Christ "marvelled at his faith," and declared "he had not found such faith, no, not in Israel?<i>" </i>Was
 Peter faithless till his master said, "Blessed art thou, Simon 
Bar-jona," &amp;c? Did the weeping penitent begin to believe only when 
Christ said to her, "Go in peace, thy faith hath saved thee?" And had 
the apostles no faith in "the promise of the Father," till their heads 
were actually crowned with celestial fire? Should we not distinguish 
between our sealing the truth of our dispensation with the seal of our 
faith, according to our present light and ability; and God's sealing the
 truth of our faith with the seal of his power, or actually rewarding us
 by the grant of some eminent and uncommon blessing? To believe is our 
part; to make "signs follow them that believe" is GOD's part; and 
because we can no more do God's part than we can make a world, is it 
agreeable either to Scripture or reason to conclude that doing our part 
is equally difficult? Can you find one single instance in the Scriptures
 of a soul willing to believe, and absolutely unable to do it? From 
these two scriptures, "Lord, increase our faith;-Lord, I believe, help 
thou my unbelief," can you justly infer that the praying disciples and 
the distressed father had no power to believe? Do not their words 
evidence just the contrary? That we cannot believe any more than we can 
eat, without the help and power of God, is what we are all agreed upon; 
but does this in the least prove that the help and power, by which we 
believe, is as far out of the reach of willing souls as the help and 
power to make a world?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Such scriptures as these: "Unto you it is given to
 believe: a man can receive nothing, except it be given him from above: 
no man can come unto me except the Father draw him: every good gift [and
 of course that of faith] cometh from the Father of lights." Such 
scriptures, I say, secure indeed the honour of free grace, but do not 
destroy the power of free agency. To us that freely believe in a holy, 
righteous God, it is given freely to believe in a gracious, bleeding 
Saviour; because the sick alone "have need of a physician;" and none but
 those who believe in God can see the need of an advocate with him. But 
ought we from hence to conclude that our unbelieving neighbours are 
necessarily debarred from "believing in God?" When our Lord said to the 
unbelieving Jews, that they could not believe in him, did he not speak 
of a moral impotency-an impotency of their own making? I ask it again, 
If they obstinately resisted the light of their inferior dispensation; 
if they were none of Christ's Jewish sheep, how could they be his 
Christian sheep? If an obstinate boy sets himself against learning the 
letters, how can he ever learn to read? If a stubborn Jew stiffly 
opposes the law of Moses, how can he submit to the law of Christ? Is it 
not strange that some good people should leap into reprobation, rather 
than admit so obvious a solution of this little difficulty?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">From the above-mentioned texts we have then no 
more reason to infer that God forces believers to believe, or that he 
believes for them, than to conclude that God constrains diligent 
tradesmen to get money, or gets it for them, because it is said, "We are
 not sufficient to think any thing as of ourselves, but our sufficiency 
is of God-who gives us all things richly to enjoy. Remember the Lord thy
 God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">From the whole I conclude, that so long as "the 
accepted time" and "the day of salvation" continue, all sinners, who 
have not yet finally hardened themselves, may day and night (through the
 help and power of the general light of Christ's "saving grace," 
mentioned John i, 9, and Tit. ii, 11,) receive some truth belonging to 
the everlasting Gospel; though it should be only this: "There is a God, 
who will call us to an account for our sins, and who spares us to break 
them off by repentance." And their cordial believing of this truth would
 make way for their receiving the higher truths that stand between them 
and the top of the mysterious ladder of truth. I grant it is impossible 
they should leap at once to the middle, much less to the highest round 
of the ladder: but if the foot of it is upon earth, in the very nature 
of things the lowest step is within their reach, and by laying hold on 
it they may go on "from faith to faith," till they stand firm even in 
the Christian faith, if distinguishing grace has elected them to hear 
the Christian Gospel. The most sudden conversions imply this gradual 
transition. As in the very nature of things, when "the Spirit of the 
Lord caught away Philip" from the eunuch, and transported him to Azotus,
 he made Philip's body rapidly measure all the distance between the 
wilderness of Gaza and Azotus: so, when he helped the Philippian jailer 
from the gates of hell to the gates of heaven in one night, he made him 
rapidly pass through the fear of God, the dread of his justice, and the 
pangs of penitential desires after salvation, before he entered into the
 joyous rest that remains for those that heartily believe in Christ. Nor
 is this quick, though gradual transition from midnight darkness to 
noon-day light an unintelligible mystery, since we are witnesses of a 
similar event every revolving day. The vegetable and the animal world 
help us likewise to understand the nature of sudden conversions. Every 
philosopher knows that a mushroom passes through almost as many stages 
of the vegetative life in six hours as an oak does in two hundred 
years:- and those animacules, that frisk into life in the morning of a 
summer's day, propagate their species at noon, are old at four o'clock, 
and dead at six, measure the length of animal life as really as 
Methuselah did his millennium. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>Saving truth is the object of saving faith. What truth is, and what great things are spoken of it. Our salvation turns upon it.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">It appears by the preceding section that saving 
TRUTH IS the ground and object of saving FAITH; but "what is TRUTH?" 
This is the awful question that Pilate once asked of Him who was best 
able to answer it. But alas! Pilate was in such haste through the lying 
fear of man, that he did not stay for an answer. May I venture to give 
one. TRUTH is spiritual <i>substance, </i>and a LIE spiritual <i>shadow. </i>TRUTH is spiritual <i>light, </i>and a LIE spiritual <i>darkness. </i>Truth is the root of all <i>virtue, </i>and a lie is the root of all <i>vice. </i>Truth
 is the celestial tincture that makes spirits good, and a lie the 
infernal tincture that makes them evil. A lie is as nearly related to 
the devil, as infection to one that has the plague, or opacity to the 
earth; and truth is as nearly related to God as fragrancy to burning 
incense, and light to the unclouded sun.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">According to this definition of truth and error, 
may we not give plain and Scriptural answers to some of the deepest 
questions in the world? What is God? The reverse of "the prince of 
darkness," and of the "father of lies:" he is "the Father of lights," 
and "the God of truth:" he "is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
 What is Christ? He is "the brightness of his Father's glory; a light-a 
great light to them that dwell in the shadow of death." He is "the 
truth; the true witness; the truth itself; Emmanuel, God with us, full 
of grace and truth." What is the Holy Ghost? "The Spirit of truth:" yea,
 says St. John, "the Spirit is truth," and "leads into all truth." What 
is Satan? "The spirit of error" that "abode not in the truth; in whom 
there is no truth," and who "deceives the nations which are in the four 
quarters of the earth."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: what is the Gospel? "The word of truth, the
 word of God the word of faith, the word of the kingdom, the word of 
life, and the word of salvation." What are Gospel ministers? Men that 
"bear witness to the truth;" that "rightly divide the word of truth;" 
that are "fellow helpers to the truth;" that "speak forth the words of 
truth;" and "are valiant for the truth upon the earth." What is the 
preaching of the Gospel? "The manifestation of the truth." What is it to
 believe the Gospel? It is to "receive the knowledge of the truth;" to 
"receive the love of the truth;" and to "obey the truth." What is it to 
mistake the Gospel? It is to "err from the truth;" to "turn after 
fables;" and to "give heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of 
devils." What is the Church? "The pillar and ground of truth, against 
which the gates of hell shall not prevail." What is the first fruit of 
sincere repentance? "The acknowledging of the truth." What are 
believers? Persons that are "chosen to salvation through the 
[unnecessitated] belief of the truth;" that "are of the truth;" that 
"know the truth;" that have "the truth in their inward parts;" that have
 "a good report of the truth; in whom dwells the truth; who have been 
taught the truth as it is in Jesus; in whom is the truth of Christ; who 
have purified their souls by obeying the truth;" and "walk in the 
truth." What are unstable souls? Persons "ever learning, and never able 
to come to the knowledge of the truth," with whom "the truth of the 
Gospel does not continue," and who are willfully "bewitched, that they 
should not obey the truth." What are obstinate unbelievers? "Men of 
corrupt minds, destitute of the truth; unreasonable men," that "resist 
the truth;" that" glory and lie against the truth;" that "walk in 
darkness, and do not the truth." "That are apostates? Men that "sin 
willfully after they have received the knowledge of the truth," and 
instead of repenting, "count the blood of the covenant, wherewith they 
were sanctified, an unholy thing." What are perfect men in Christ? Men 
that are "established in the present truth," i.e. in the truth revealed 
under the Christian dispensation, and that can do nothing against the 
truth, but for the truth.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If all turns thus upon TRUTH, and if truth is at 
once spiritual light, and the object of saving faith, it follows: (1.) 
That to walk in the truth, to walk in the light, and to walk by faith, 
are phrases of the same import. (2.) That to be converted is to be 
"turned from darkness to light," that is, from the practical belief of a
 lie to the practical belief of the truth;" or, as St. Paul expresses 
it, "from the power of Satan unto God." And (3.) That the chief business
 of the tempter is to "take the word of truth out of our hearts, lest we
 should believe and be saved;" or, in other terms, to "blind our minds, 
lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto us."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If Jesus Christ is the truth, the light, the life,
 and the Word, that "was in the beginning with God, and was God;" the 
Word "by which all things were made," and are preserved: if he is "the 
light that shineth in darkness," "even when the darkness comprehendeth 
it not:" if "he is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh 
into the world," while the day of salvation lasts: if he is the 
archetype, the eternal, living pattern of all saving truth: if he is the
 essential, almighty Word, from whom revealed truth and the word of our 
salvation flow as constantly as light and heat from the sun: do we not 
slight him, and despise eternal life, when we slight the truth, and 
despise the Word? And may not the great things spoken of the Word 
confirm what has been said of the truth, and help us to answer the 
questions already proposed in a manner equally Scriptural and 
conclusive?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Not forgetting that there is such a thing as "the 
word nigh, the word behind" us, the "still small voice," and "the word 
of that grace which has appeared unto all men, teaching them to deny 
worldly lusts, and to live soberly," &amp;c, I ask, What are 
evangelists? Men who "bear record of the word of God," and "bear witness
 of the light, that all men may believe." "Sowers, that sow the word of 
the kingdom: holding forth the word of life." What are false apostles? 
Men that "corrupt the word of God," that "handle the word of God 
deceitfully," and "preach another Gospel; whose words eat as does a 
canker." What are believers? People that "hear the word of God and keep 
it;" that are "begotten of God by the word of truth;" that "are born 
again <i>by </i>the word of God;" that "hear the sayings of Christ, and 
do them; in whose hearts the word of Christ dwells richly; who receive 
it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, 
which worketh effectually in them that believe" it. They are persons 
that "receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save 
their souls;" that have "tasted the good word of God," that "desire the 
sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby;" that "gladly 
receive the word; have God's word abiding in them;" are made "clean 
through the word which Christ speaks" by his ministers, his Scriptures, 
his Spirit, his works, or his rod; and "in whom the seed of that word 
produces" thirty fold, sixty fold, or a hundred fold, according to their
 light, faithfulness, and opportunity.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: what are unbelievers? Antinomian hypocrites
 "that hear the sayings of Christ, and do them not;" or Pharisaic 
"despisers that stumble at the word, speak against those things which 
are spoken by" God's messengers; "contradicting and blaspheming;" and 
who, by "putting the word of God from them, judge themselves unworthy of
 eternal life." What are martyrs? Witnesses of the truth; "slain for the
 word of God." And what are apostates? Persons in whom "the word is 
choked by the cares of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches;" who 
"fall away when persecution ariseth because of the word; by reason of 
whom the way of truth is evil spoken of;" and in whom the seed of the 
word "becometh unfruitful." Thus all turns still upon truth and the word
 of God.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION III. <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>That according to reason and Scripture there is a saving, almighty</i> <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>power in truth and the word of God.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">SHOULD the reader ask here how it is possible the 
word and the truth should be so nearly related to our Saviour, that to 
receive them is to receive him, and to reject them is to reject him and 
his salvation: I answer, that in the spiritual, as well as in the 
political and mercantile world, signs are necessary by which to convey 
our thoughts and resolutions. Hence the use of letters, notes, bonds, 
and charters; of revelations, traditions, Scriptures, and sacraments. 
Now an honest man's word is as good as his bond or pledge, and as true 
as his heart; his word or bond being nothing but his mind or 
determination fairly conveyed to others by the means of his tongue or of
 his hand. Therefore, in the very nature of things, to receive the word 
of Christ is to receive Christ, who "dwells in our hearts by faith;" 
whom believers "know now after the flesh no more:" who commissioned his 
favourite apostle to say, "He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ 
hath both the Father and the Son;" and who personally declares, "My 
mother and my brothers are these," that "hear the word of God and keep 
it."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">As the legislative power has appointed that pure 
gold duly stamped, and bank notes properly drawn up, shall represent the
 value, and procure the possession of all the necessaries and 
conveniences of life, which can be bought with money; so our heavenly 
Lawgiver has fixed that the "word of truth" shall answer, in his 
spiritual kingdom, the end of gold and letters of exchange in the 
kingdoms of this world; and this spiritual gold, this "word tried to the
 uttermost," he offers to all that are "poor, and blind, and naked, that
 they may be rich in faith. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in 
the fire, that thou mayest be rich."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: as a will conveys an immense fortune; and a
 death warrant a capital punishment; so does the word of God convey "the
 unsearchable riches of Christ" to obedient believers, and the dreadful 
punish rents of the damned to obstinate unbelievers. I readily grant 
that a bank note is not gold, that a will is not an estate, and that a 
death warrant is not the gallows. Nevertheless, so strong is the 
connection between those seemingly insignificant signs, and the 
important things which they signify, that none but fools will throw away
 their bank notes, or the wills of their friends as waste paper; none 
but madmen will sport with their death warrant as with a play bill. Now 
if the written word of men, who, through forgetfulness, fickleness, 
impotence, or unfaithfulness, often break their engagements, can 
nevertheless have such force; how excessively fool hardy are sinners 
that disregard the word of the King of kings, "who cannot lie!" the 
proclamations of the "God of truth, with whom no word is impossible!" 
the promises and threatenings, the will and testament of the Almighty, 
who says, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass 
away!"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Once more: although "no man knows the Father" 
immediately "but the Son," yet the Father may be mediately known by his 
works, his word, and his Son. For, leaving room for the liberty of moral
 agents and their works, God's works are always as his word. Hence we 
read: "God said, Let there be light, and there was light. Cursed be the 
ground for man's sake," and the ground was cursed. "For he spake, and it
 was done; he commanded, and it stood fast." As God's works are the 
express image of his word uttered without,-of his outgoing word (if I 
may so speak;) so his out-going word is the express image of his 
immanent, essential word, which is his eternal mind, and which the 
Scriptures call indifferently, "the Word, the Wisdom, the Son of God," 
or "the express image of his Father's glory." Hence it appears that as 
the essential Word, Christ, is one with the Father; so the word of 
saving truth is one with the Son; and that David, Solomon, and St. Paul,
 spoke noble truths when they said, "Whoso despiseth the word shall be 
destroyed. By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the 
destroyer. The law, or word of the Lord, is an undefiled word: it is 
sure, and giveth wisdom to the simple; it is right, and rejoiceth the 
heart; it is pure, and giveth light; it is true, and righteous 
altogether; more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold: 
better to me than thousands of gold and silver: sweeter also than honey,
 and the honey comb. It is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my 
path; by it is thy servant taught and made wise to salvation; and in 
keeping of it there is great reward, even the reward of the 
inheritance," a kingdom of grace here, and a kingdom of glory hereafter.
  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But let our Lord himself be heard, and he will 
join himself in mystic trinity to the word, and to the truth of God. He 
promiscuously uses the expressions truth and word, which make the burden
 of the last section. When he recommends his disciples to his Father, he
 says, "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth." Hence it 
appears that the truth and the word are terms of the same import; that 
the word of truth is a sanctifying emanation from God, and the ordinary 
vehicle of the Divine power; and that our Lord uttered a rational 
mystery when he said, "He that receiveth you [the witnesses of my truth 
and the sowers of my word] receiveth me; and he that receiveth me 
receiveth him that sent me." But "whosoever shall be ashamed of me and 
of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in 
the glory of his Father." And imperfect believers he encouraged thus: 
"If ye continue in my word, &amp;c, ye shall know the truth, and the 
truth shall make you free, &amp;c. If the Son shall make you free, ye 
shall be free indeed." Important scriptures these, which show the 
connection of the truth with the Son of God! Blessed scriptures, which 
St. Paul sums up in the following words: "Say not in thy heart, Who 
shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above;) 
or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again 
from the dead.) But what saith the righteousness which is of faith? The 
word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart; that is, the word
 of faith, which we preach."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Nor is this doctrine of the apostle contrary to 
what he says on another occasion: "The kingdom of God is not in word, 
but in power," i.e. true religion does not consist in fine talking, but 
in powerful believing and holy living. For what is more powerful than 
truth? "Truth is great, and will prevail:" truth is the strongest thing 
in the world: it overturns the thrones of tyrants, and supports God's 
everlasting throne.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: the word of man brings strange things to 
pass. Let but a general speak, and an army of Russians marches up 
through clouds of smoke, flames of fire, and volleys of iron balls, to 
form heaps of dead or dying bodies before the intrenchments of the 
Turks. An admiral gives the word of command, it may be only by hoisting a
 flag, and a fleet is under sail; artificial clouds and thunders are 
formed over the sea; the billows seem to be mingled with fire; and the 
king of terror flies from deck to deck in his most dreadful and bloody 
forms.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If such is the power of the word of a man, who is 
but a worm, how almighty must be the word of God! "By the word of the 
Lord were the heavens made," saith David: "The worlds were framed by the
 word of God," adds St. Paul, "and he upholdeth all things by the word 
of his power." That word no necessary agents can resist. It rolls the 
planets with as much ease as hurricanes whirl the dust. If free agents 
can resist his word of command, it is only because he permits it for 
their trial. But woe to them that resist it to the end of their day of 
probation: for they shall feel the resistless force of his word of 
punishment: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." And who 
is the God that shall break the adamantine, infernal chains, which that 
dreadful word will rivet upon them?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">We read in the Gospel that our Lord marvelled at 
the centurion's faith, as greater faith than he had found in Israel. But
 wherein consisted the peculiar greatness of that man's faith? Is it not
 evident, from the context, that it was in the noble and lively 
apprehension which he had of the force and energy of Christ's word? 
"Lord," said he, "I am a man under the authority [of my colonel and 
general, and yet] having soldiers under me, I say to one, Go, and he 
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh," &amp;c. Now, Lord, if my 
word has such power, what cannot thine do? "Speak the word only, and my 
servant shall be healed."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Why is Abraham called "the father of the 
faithful?" Is it not because "judging Him faithful [and almighty] that 
had promised, against hope he believed in hope, that he should become 
the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall
 thy seed be?" Is it not because "he staggered not at the promise, [or 
word] of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to 
God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to 
perform; and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness? And 
shall not the like faith be imputed to us also, if we believe" the 
saving truth revealed, or the Divine record given under the present 
dispensation of the Gospel, viz. "that God raised up Jesus our Lord from
 the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our 
justification?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">O! who can describe the needless perplexities of 
those willful unbelievers that have the truth of their dispensation 
clearly brought to them, and yet, like Thomas, resolutely set themselves
 against it, saying, "I will not believe!" And who can enumerate the 
blessings which those childlike souls inherit, who, instead of 
quarrelling with, cordially embrace the word of God, and set to their 
seal that God is true? They seal God's truth, and God seals their 
hearts. "Their faith is imputed to them for righteousness; their faith 
saves them; it is done to them according to their faith; the God of hope
 fills them with all joy and peace in believing." Thus, "through faith, 
they [not only] subdue the kingdom [of darkness, but] inherit the 
[present] kingdom of God, righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy 
Ghost, received by the hearing of faith." Well disposed reader, if thou 
doubtest the truth of those scriptures, try it by believing now what 
appears to thee to be the saving truth of thy dispensation: believe it 
with all thy present might, be it little or be it much; and if in a 
little time thou dost not find thyself more settled and free, more able 
to fight against sin, and to take up thy cross, let me bear the blame 
for ever.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Did the success of God's word depend only upon 
him, the truth would always operate in a saving manner. If men were not 
to "work out their own salvation" by freely repenting, believing, and 
obeying, with the power "to will and to do," which God gives them of his
 good pleasure, all mankind would repent, believe, and obey, as 
passively as clocks go, and as regularly as the sun rises. But we are 
moral agents; and works morally good depend as much upon the concurrence
 of God's free grace, and of our free obedience of faith, as the birth 
of the prince of Wales did upon the marriage of the king and queen. 
Hence we read: "To whom sware he that they should not enter ink his 
rest, but to them that believed not? For the word preached did not 
profit them," not because the seed was bad, or because they had no power
 to receive it, but because "it was not mixed with faith in them that 
heard it. "Wherefore," says the apostle, "to-day if you will hear his 
voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c. Take heed lest there be in any of
 you an evil heart of unbelief, &amp;c, and exhort one another daily" to
 believe.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The genuine seed of the word is then always good, 
always full of Divine energy. If it does not spring up, or if, after it 
has sprung up, it does not "bring forth fruit to perfection," it is 
entirely the fault of the ground. "The words that I speak," says our 
Lord, though it should be only by the mouth of my servants, "they are 
spirit and they are life" to believing hearts. For "Christ gave himself 
for the Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing 
of water by the word; if it continue in the faith, holding fast the 
faithful word,-the word of the truth of the Gospel, which is come in all
 the world, and bringeth forth fruit" since the day it is heard in 
faith; it being the grand office of the Spirit to make "the word of 
God," when it is mixed with faith on our part, "sharper than any 
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and 
spirit," and "to the discerning [and destroying of the bad] thoughts and
 intents of the heart."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Nothing, therefore, can be more certain than the 
connection between the power of God and the truth of the Gospel. "Truth 
(says a divine of the last century) is that eternal word of the Father 
which, in the Son, by the Holy Ghost, is revealed to us, to be our guide
 back again to that bosom whence it and" we first came: it is that 
Jacob's ladders let down to us from heaven to earth, whereby his angels 
(his messengers) lead up from earth to heaven: it is that Rahab's 
scarlet thread, let down from the window of heaven to wind us up by. The
 apostle calls it a girdle, 'the girdle of truth,' a girdle, that by 
many several links ending where it began, returning whence it first 
proceeded, clasps itself again in the bosom of its author, God." 
According to this noble description of truth, is it not evident that all
 the righteous power which works in the spiritual world is the power of 
God and of truth? And therefore that our Lord answered like Divine 
wisdom "manifest in the flesh" when he asserted that "to believe on him 
is to work the work of God:" that "he who believeth hath everlasting 
life:" that" though he were dead, yet shall he live:" that "he that 
liveth and believeth on him [which implies a continuance of the action] 
shall never die:" that "rivers of living water [streams of comfort and 
power] shall flow out of his belly [i.e. spring from his inmost soul;] 
and that he shall do great works, the Gospel being the power of God to 
salvation to every one that believeth;" and "all things being possible 
to him that believeth," because his faith apprehends the word, truth, 
and power of the Almighty.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION IV. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>There are various sorts of truths. Idolatry and
 formality consist in pulling inferior in the room of superior truths. 
Evangelical and moral, </i>i.e. <i>religious truth alone change the heart.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">WHEN I said that living faith has saving truth for
 its object, I did not use the word "saving" without reason: for as 
every stone is not precious, so every truth is not saving. There are 
then various sorts of truths. "There is a sun," is a <i>physical </i>or <i>natural </i>truth. "Our ideas of the sun are mental pictures of the sun," is a <i>metaphysical </i>truth. "All the points of a circle are equally distant from the center," is a <i>mathematical </i>truth. "NO just conclusion can be drawn from false premises," is a <i>logical </i>truth. "Alexander conquered Persia," is a <i>historical </i>truth.
 "There is a God, and this God is to be worshipped according to the 
different manifestations of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," are two <i>religious </i>truths, the first of which belongs to <i>natural, </i>and the second to <i>revealed religion. </i>"Every man is to love his neighbour as himself," is a <i>moral </i>truth. "A spiritual Jew is circumcised in heart, and a spiritual Christian is baptized with the Spirit," is an <i>evangelical </i>truth, typified by the outward signs of circumcision and of baptism.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">When <i>natural </i>and inferior truths raise our minds to the God of <i>nature </i>and of <i>grace, </i>they answer their <i>spiritual </i>ends:
 but if they are put in the place of their archetypes and antitypes, 
"the truth of God is changed into a lie." Take some instances of it: 
"The invisible things of God," says St. Paul, "are understood by the 
things that are made," or visible; but who considers the profound truth 
couched under his words? Certainly not those heathens who worship the <i>material, </i>instead of the <i>immaterial </i>Sun:
 nor those Jews who are regardless of the circumcision of the heart, and
 rest satisfied with an external circumcision: nor those Papists who pay
 Divine honours to a bit of typical bread which their fancy has turned 
into the identical body of our Lord: nor yet those Protestants who, 
being unmindful of the baptism of the Spirit, exert themselves only in 
sprinkling infants with, or dipping adults in material water: for they 
all equally forget that the letter of natural and typical things alone 
profiteth little, or nothing comparatively; and that it killeth, when it
 is opposed to the Spirit, and made to supersede the invisible and 
heavenly archetypes, which visible and earthly things shadow out; or 
when it causes us to set aside the precious antitypes which typical 
things point unto.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Thus thousands of sinners, like the rich glutton 
in the Gospel, are spiritually, if not corporally, killed by meats and 
drinks, which should raise them to their invisible archetypes, the 
heavenly manna, and the wine of God's kingdom. Thus conjugal love, which
 should raise married persons to a more lively contemplation of the 
mystical union between the heavenly bridegroom and his faithful spouse, 
has a quite contrary effect upon numbers. Absurdly resting in the fading
 type, they think that "I have married a wife," is a sufficient reason 
to give Christ a bill of divorce, or to show him the greatest 
indifference. Thus also the Jews committed the deadly sins of idolatry 
and murder, through their regard for their brazen serpent and the 
temple; an extravagant regard this, which caused them to neglect, and at
 last to crucify Christ, the invaluable antitype of both the brazen 
serpent and of the temple.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hence it appears that the sin of formalists is not
 unlike that of idolaters. As God has blessed his Church with various 
forms of worship, and literal manifestations of his truth, that they 
might lead us to the power of godliness, and to the truth in the Spirit;
 so he has filled the natural world with a variety of creatures which 
bear some signatures of his own unseen excellences. But alas! if we are 
only formal and letter-learned professors, we absurdly set up our forms 
and the letter against the power and spiritual operations which they 
shadow out: and if we are idolaters, we "love and serve the creature 
more than the Creator," who has given us the outlines of his invisible 
glories in the visible creation, that in and through every thing we 
"might feel after him and find him." Thus formality and idolatry equally
 defeat God's gracious designs toward mankind, the one by opposing 
forms, and the other by opposing creatures to God.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To return: all sorts of truths, if they are kept 
in their proper places, may improve the understanding: but religious 
truths only have a direct tendency to improve the will, which is the 
spring of our tempers and actions. Therefore, "although I have all 
knowledge" but that which is productive of "charity, I am nothing:" the 
faith of God's elect being only the cordial, practical acknowledging of 
"the truth, which is after godliness-of the saving "truth, as it is in 
Jesus."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">A total inattention to every kind of truth makes a
 man brutish. An eager pursuit of natural, mathematical, logical, 
historical truths, &amp;c, attended with a neglect of religious truths, 
tends to make a man an infidel: and this neglect, grown up into an 
obstinate, practical opposition to moral as well as to evangelical 
truths, turns him into "an enemy of all righteousness," and a 
persecutor.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But when candour, a degree of which we may have 
through the light that enlightens every man; when free agency, assisted 
by the Spirit of power, that accompanies the word of truth; when 
candour, I say, and free agency thus assisted, attend and submit to the 
religious truths revealed under our dispensation; then the Divine "seed 
falls into good ground;" Christ begins to be formed in our hearts; and, 
according to our dispensation, "we receive power to become sons of God: 
for we [even as many as 'receive with meekness the ingrafted word'] are 
all the children of God through faith in the light of the world, 
"through faith in Christ Jesus, who is the Saviour of all men, but 
especially of them that believe unto righteousness;" whether they do it 
with meridian light and intense fervour, as true Christians; with 
morning light and growing vigour, as pious Jews; or only with dawning 
light and timorous sincerity, as converted heathens.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Some sorts of truth, like some kinds of food, are 
richer than others. Infants in grace must be fed with the plainest 
truths, which the apostle calls milk; but stronger souls may feast upon 
what would give a surfeit to "babes in Christ:" "for every one that 
useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness. But strong meat 
belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who, by reason of 
use, have their spiritual senses exercised to discern both good and 
evil," truth and error, as quickly and as surely as our bodily senses 
distinguish sweet from bitter, and light from darkness. Truth is 
spiritual light: too much of it might dazzle the weak eyes of our 
understanding. A parabolical blind[fold] is of great service in such a 
case. When the apostles were yet carnal, our Lord said to them, "I have 
many things to say to you, but ye cannot hear them now:" no, not in 
parables. "Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you 
into all [evangelical] truth." A sure proof this that truth is the 
light, the food, the way of souls; and that the grand business of the 
Spirit is to "lead us into the truth," as we can bear it, and as we 
choose to walk in it. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>Truth cordially embraced by faith saves under </i>every <i>dispensation
 of Divine grace, though in different degrees. A short view of the 
truths that characterize the four grand dispensations of the everlasting
 Gospel.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I HAVE signified that faith is more or less 
operative, according to the quality of the truths which it embraces. 
This observation recommends itself to reason: for as some wines are more
 generous, and some remedies more powerful, so some truths are more 
reviving and sanctifying than others. But every evangelical truth, being
 a beam of the "Sun of righteousness risen" upon us "with healing in his
 wings," is of a saving nature. Thus I am saved from ATHEISM, by 
heartily believing there is a God who will judge the world;-from 
PHARISAISM, by firmly believing that I am a miserable sinner, and that 
"without Christ I can do nothing;"-from SADDUCEISM, by truly believing 
that "the Spirit itself helpeth my infirmities;"-from ANTINOMIANISM, by 
cordially believing that "God is not a respecter of persons, but a 
rewarder of them that diligently seek him," and a punisher of all that 
presumptuously break his commandments;-and from DESPAIR, by steadily 
believing that "God is love," that "he sent his only begotten Son into 
the world to save that which is lost," and that I "have an Advocate with
 the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hence it appears, (1.) That every religious truth,
 suitable to our present circumstances, (when it is kindly represented 
by free grace, and affectionately embraced by prevented free will,) 
instantly forms, according to its degree, the saving, operative faith 
that converts, transforms, and renews the soul. And, (2.) That this 
faith is more or less operative, according to the quality of the truth 
presented to us; according to the power with which the Spirit of grace 
impresses it upon our hearts; and according to the earnestness with 
which we receive, espouse, and welcome it to our inmost souls.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">When God fixed "the bounds of the habitation of 
mankind," he placed some nations in warm climates and fruitful 
countries, where the juice of the grape is plentiful next to water. And 
to others he assigned a barren, rocky soil, covered with snow half the 
year; water is their cordial, nor have they any more idea of their want 
of wine than St. Peter had of his want of the blood of Christ, when he 
made the noble confession upon which the Christian Church is founded. 
"O," says a Predestinarian geographer, "the God of providence has 
absolutely reprobated those poor creatures." "Not so," replies an 
unprejudiced philosopher, "they may he as healthy and happy over their 
cup of cold water as some of our men of fortune are over the bottles of 
Claret and Madeira that load their festive tables. And some of those 
poor creatures, as you call them, may 'come from the east and from the 
west to drink' the wine of the kingdom of God 'with Abraham,' when 'the 
children of the kingdom shall be thrust out.'"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">What I have said of water and wine may illustrate 
what the Scriptures say of the truths peculiar to the Gospel 
dispensation. God forbid that an antichristian zeal for the Christian 
Gospel should make me drive into the burning lake Christ's sheep which 
are "big with young:" mean the sincere worshippers that wait, like pious
 Melchisedec, devout Lydia, and charitable Cornelius, for brighter 
displays of Gospel race. For there are faithful souls that follow their 
light under every dispensation, concerning whom our Lord kindly said, 
"Other sheep I have which are not of this [Jewish] fold: them also I 
must bring [into marvellous light,] and there shall be one fold and one 
Shepherd." those feeble sheep and tender lambs I must take into my 
bosom; and to give them their portion of meat in due season, I venture 
upon the following remark:- If free will, prevented by free grace, 
ardently receives the truths of the Christian Gospel, Christian faith is
 conceived. If the heart fervently embraces the truths of the Jewish or 
Gentile Gospel, (those which are peculiar to the Christian Gospel 
remaining as yet veiled,) the faith of a Jew or of a heathen is 
begotten. Nevertheless, if this faith, let it be ever so assaulted by 
doubts, impregnates the soul with truth, and works by love, it is saving
 in its degree.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I say <i>in its degree; </i>for as there are in 
the earth various rich tinctures, some of which form diamonds, while 
others form only rubies, emeralds, or agates; so there are in the 
universal Church of Christ various tinctures of Gospel truth, which form
 various orders of spiritual jewels, as appears from such scriptures as 
these:-"They that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and they 
shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my 
jewels. For in every nation he that feareth God and worketh 
righteousness is accepted of him," according to the dispensation he is 
under, and the progress he has made in practical religion.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">This Gospel, for example, "God hath made of one 
blood all nations of men, that they should seek the Lord [as the 
gracious Author of their being, and] love one another as brothers:" this
 everlasting Gospel, I say, has in all countries leavened the hearts of 
pious heathens with "sincerity and truth." This doctrine, "Messiah will 
come to point out clearly the way of salvation," added to the Gospel of 
the Gentiles, has tinctured with superior goodness the hearts of all 
believing Jews. This truth, "Messiah is come in the flesh," superadded 
to the Jewish Gospel, has enlarged the hearts of all the disciples of 
John, or the "babes in Christ." And these truths, "Christ died for my 
sins, and rose again for my justification; he is ascended up on high; he
 has received the gift of the Spirit for men,-for me. I believe on him 
by the power of that Spirit. He dwells in my heart by faith. He is in me
 the hope of glory. The promise of the Father is fulfilled; the kingdom 
of God, righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost is come with 
power." These richer truths, I say, superadded to those which are 
essential to the inferior dispensations, tincture the hearts of all 
adult Christians, and make them more or less intimately one with Christ,
 according to the degree of their faith, and the influences of his 
Spirit.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The field of truth is as boundless as the Divine 
perfections; and the treasures it contains are as unsearchable as the 
riches of Christ, Here we may literally say, "Deep calleth unto 
deep-Canst thou by searching find out the Almighty to perfection? It is 
as high as heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper than hell, what canst thou
 know?" These three capital truths only-"God is-God is love-God is mine 
in Christ"-are more than sufficient to replace my soul in paradise. I 
know but little of them; and yet, thanks be to God! I know enough to 
make me anticipate heavenly bliss. Now, is it the least part of my 
present happiness to rejoice that there is an eternity before me to 
unfold the wonders of truth, and to explore the "mystery of God. Now I 
see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know but in 
part, but then I shall know even as also I am known."  </font>
