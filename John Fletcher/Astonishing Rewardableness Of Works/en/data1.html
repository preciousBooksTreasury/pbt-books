<p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION VI. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>Saving faith is more particularly described by 
its rise and operations; and distinguished from the faith of trembling 
devils, immoral Antinomians, penitents sold under sin, and modish 
professors who believe without frame and feeling.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If we assent to a religious truth merely because 
we cannot resist its evidence;-if we hate it, wanting to shake it off, 
wishing it were a lie, and fretting because we cannot make it so; we 
have the faith of devils: for "devils believe and tremble;" the force of
 the awful truths which they cannot deny giving them a foretaste of 
infernal torments. Of this sort, it seems, was the faith of Felix, when 
St. Paul reasoned before him of "justice, temperance, and judgment to 
come." This alarming doctrine, supported by the suffrage of conscience, 
and impressed by "the Spirit of truth," made the noble heathen 
"tremble;" but soon recovering himself, he fought against the truth that
 had laid hold on him unawares, and he kept it at arm's length, till he 
could shake it off as the apostle did the viper that fastened on his 
hand; or at least till he could run away from it, by plunging as 
desperately into a sea of sensual delights, as the devils in the swine 
did into the sea of Galilee.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The faith of immoral professors is not much better
 than the faith of Felix and Satan. They believe some glorious truths, 
but not with the heart to righteousness. Two or three comparisons may 
help us to understand this "mystery of iniquity." When a person visits 
you, you may either receive him with cold civility, as a stranger; or 
embrace him with warm affection as a bosom friend. From secret motives 
you may show a peculiar regard to a man whom you secretly despise or 
detest. He has a good voice, you love music, and he ministers to your 
amusement. Perhaps you want him to cloak the sin of his Bathsheba; 
perhaps you are a party man; he is a proper tool for you; and therefore 
you make much of him. But while your regard for him springs merely from 
such external circumstances, can it ever be personal and sincere? 
Equally ungenerous however is the regard that Gallio and Fulsome have 
for the truth. Gallio holds fast the doctrine of general redemption, 
because he fondly supposes that he has only to avoid robbery and murder 
to go to heaven: Fulsome extols "everlasting love," but it is because he
 thinks that it gives him the liberty of loving the world, without the 
least danger of losing God's eternal favour.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">He embraces "justification by faith alone;" but it
 is because he confounds the works of faith and the works of the law, 
and vainly hopes to be finally justified without either. He shouts, 
"Free grace for ever!" because it insures, as he thinks, his eternal 
salvation, whatever length he may go in sin. He is a partial anatomist; 
he dissects the body of truth, throws away the vitals, and only 
preserves those parts which seem to countenance his immoral scheme. I 
question if an Indian warrior is more fond of the scalp of an 
Englishman, than Gallio is of the doctrine of "God's mercy," separated 
from God's holiness and justice; or Fulsome of the doctrine of "Christ's
 merits," torn away from the evangelical worthiness of sincere 
obedience.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Nay, a judicious Gnostic may admire and espouse a 
well connected system of religious truth, just as a virtuoso admires and
 purchases a good collection of shells. The virtuoso contends for the 
beauty and rarity of his marine toys with as much passionateness as if 
they were parts of himself: but they only lie upon cotton in his 
drawers, far enough from his breast. And the Gnostic disputes for the 
truths he has taken a fancy to with as much warmth as if they were 
incorporated with himself; but he contrives that they shall pass like 
flying clouds over his understanding, without descending in fruitful 
showers upon his heart.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Truth is the wholesome food of souls. Hence it is 
said, "The just shall live by his faith," by his receiving Christ in the
 word of truth, and by mystically feeding upon him, according to these 
deep words: "Except you eat my flesh, and drink my blood, ye have no 
life in you:" or, as St. John expresses it, "the truth is not in you." 
Now, as food must be inwardly taken, and properly digested, before it 
can nourish us; so must truth. If men, therefore, who "buy the truth" in
 theory, and "sell it" in practice, who "profess it in words, and deny 
it in works," have not power to take up their cross and to follow 
Christ; we ought no more on that account to conclude that the truth is 
inefficacious to our salvation, than to suppose that good food is 
improper for our nourishment, because men that spend their time in 
preparing it for others, in drawing up bills of fare, in placing dishes 
to the best advantage, and in inviting others to eat heartily, while 
they live upon trash themselves, have not strength to go through a hard 
day's work.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: from such scriptures as these: "I will heal
 their backslidings: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee: God 
shall send forth his mercy and his truth: he sent his word and healed 
them," &amp;c, it is evident that evangelical truth is, next to Christ, 
the medicine as well as the food of souls. Now, as it is absurd to 
suppose that speculating upon a medicine, instead of taking it, can 
conduce to the recovery of our bodily health, so it is unreasonable to 
fancy that bare speculations upon the doctrines of the Gospel can be 
productive of saving health; cordial believing having no less necessary a
 reference to truth, than real drinking to a potion. Hence appears the 
necessity of clearly distinguishing between saving faith and Antinomian 
fancy; between the faith by which a man affectionately believes with an 
humble heart unto righteousness; and its counterfeit, by which a man 
idly believes with a conceited mind to practical Antinomianism, whether 
he be a follower of Mr. Wesley or of Mr. Romaine.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The soaring faith of an immoral Antinomian is far 
inferior to the abortive faith of an imperfect penitent, and even to 
doubting. When truth and error present themselves to our minds together,
 (as they always do in every trial of faith,) so long as we remain in 
suspense between them, we continue in the uneasy state, between faith 
and unbelief, which we call "doubting." But when truth appears more 
beautiful than error to the eye of our understanding, without appearing 
good enough prevalently to engage our affections; we are in the 
uncomfortable state of the carnal penitent whom St. Paul describes in 
his own person, Rom vii. We approve the revealed will of God, and 
"delight in his law after the inward man." If the celestial rose were 
not beset with thorns, we would instantly gather it, If we had no bodily
 appetites to resist, no ignominious cross to take up, no false wisdom 
to part with, we would heartily believe and "work the work of God." But 
we cannot yet give up our bosom sin; carnal reason and the flesh prevail
 still against the spirit, though not without a struggle; unbelief and 
abortive faith (if I may use the expression) wrestling in our distracted
 breasts, as Esau and Jacob did in Rebecca's womb; and making us 
complain, "The good that I would do," if it cost me nothing, "I do not: 
but the evil I would not, that I do," because it gratifies my fallen 
nature. Thus with his mind, his rational powers, the carnal penitent 
"serves the law of God" by good, though ineffectual resolutions; but 
with his flesh, his carnal appetites, he "serves the law of sin" by bad,
 though lamented performances.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Here I beg leave to account for the famous confession of the princess, who cries out in Ovid,* <i>Video meliora, proboque,-deleriora sequor, </i>which may be thus paraphrased: "I stand between the rough, steep, ascending path of virtue, <i>[bonum honestum,] </i>and the plain, flowery, downward road of vice, <i>[bonum jucundum.] </i>Conscience
 says that the one is far more commendable; passion declares that the 
other is far more pleasing. I madly give the casting vote to hurrying 
passion; it decides that the pleasure of a present, certain 
gratification, be it ever so sinful, overbalances the fear of a future, 
uncertain punishment, be it ever so terrible: and notwithstanding the 
remonstrances of my conscience, I submit to the hazardous decision of my
 appetite; secretly hoping that God does not regard my crimes, or that a
 day of retribution is a chimera."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[* I see what is right and approve it, but do what is wrong. ]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To return: faith does not struggle into birth 
without her coeval child and constant partner, hope. When faith fails, 
despair groans, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?" But 
when faith revives, hope lifts up her head, and cries, "I thank God 
[there is deliverance] through Jesus Christ our Lord." Thus we go on 
falling and rising, dying and reviving, till we are quite tired of the 
sins which hinder us from welcoming the saving truth with a more cordial
 embrace; and when we do this, our faith is unfeigned; the Lord sets to 
it the broad seal of his power; it proves victorious; we enter into 
Gospel liberty, and instead of the old note, "Who shall deliver me we 
sing, under the Christian dispensation, "Christ hath delivered us from 
the curse of the law" of sin, as well as from the curse of the law of 
innocence and of the ceremonial law. "There is no condemnation to them 
that [believe and] walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The manner in which this deliverance is generally 
wrought, may be more particularly described thus:-Free grace, "at sundry
 times and in divers places speaks to our consciences, recommending "the
 word nigh,-the commandment" that is "everlasting life," the truth that 
contains the regenerating power of God. If it be "the day of 
provocation," we unnecessarily begin "to make excuse." We cannot come to
 the marriage feast. We are either too good, too bad, or too busy to 
entertain the truth; and we say as civilly as Felix, "Go thy way for 
this time, [when I shall be more fit, or] when I shall have a more 
convenient season, I will call for thee." Perhaps we perversely "harden 
our heart, contradicting, blaspheming," and saying as the Pharisees, "We
 will not have this [truth] to reign over us. Away with it!" But if it 
be the day of conversion, if our free willing soul "know the time of our
 visitation," humbly bowing at the word of the Lord, and saying, as the 
Virgin Mary, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord, let it be done unto me 
according to thy word;" I am a lost sinner, but "there is mercy with 
thee that thou mayest be feared:" then the seed of the kingdom, the word
 of God, "is received in an honest and good heart;" for nothing is 
wanting to render the heart initially good and honest, but the sincere 
submission of our free will, to that free grace which courts us, and 
says, "Behold! I stand at the door [of every heart] and knock. If any 
man hear my voice and open, I will come in and sup with him, and he with
 me." He shall "taste how good the Lord is," he shall "taste the good 
word of God and the powers [of truth, which are the powers] of the world
 to come." And so shall he rise superior to shadows and lies, which are 
the powers of this present evil world.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Thus opens the kingdom of God in the believing 
soul: thus is Christ the "truth and the life," formed in the heart by 
faith: thus grace begins to "reign through righteousness unto eternal 
life by Jesus Christ."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I call that faith "saving and operative," because 
so long as it lives, it saves; and so long as it saves, it "works 
righteousness,"-it works by a righteous fear of the evil denounced 
against sin; by a righteous opposition to every known sin; by a 
righteous hope of the good promised to obedience; and by a righteous 
love of the truth that has produced it, and of the Father of lights, 
from whom that truth proceeds; it being scarcely possible to welcome 
heartily a beam of the sun for its brightness, without indirectly 
welcoming the sun itself. Therefore, when living faith ceases to "work,"
 it dies away, as the heart that ceases to beat; it goes out, as a 
candle that ceases to shine.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"But, upon this footing, what becomes of the 
modish doctrine of a faith without frame and feeling?" If the ministers,
 who recommend such a faith, mean that we must set our heart as a seal 
to the Gospel truths adapted to our present state, and stamp them with 
all our might, not considering whether our <i>fallen </i>nature and <i>carnal </i>reason relish them, and steadily following the poet's direction,  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">"Tu ne cede malis; sed contra audentior ito,  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Quam MALA te NATURA sinit:"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">they maintain a truth, a great truth, which cannot
 be too much urged upon tempered, desponding, and despairing souls. But 
if they mean that we must believe ourselves unconditionally elected to 
glory, be the frame of our minds ever so carnal, and the feelings of our
 hearts ever so worldly, they destroy "the health of the daughter of 
God's people," with as rank poison as ever grew in spiritual Egypt. I am
 no judge of what passes in the breasts of those gentlemen; but, for my 
part, I never feel faith more strongly at work than when I wrestle not 
only with flesh and blood, but with the banded powers of darkness.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">None but a dead man is quite destitute of frame 
and feeling. It is not a real flame that neither warms in winter nor 
shines in the dark. The moment a light is not in its degree able to 
triumph over darkness, and even to turn it into light, it ceases to be a
 true light. You may see in Windsor Castle a candle most exquisitely 
painted; it shines as steadfastly as Mr. Fulsome believes. Was the 
coloured canvass as loquacious as that Antinomian hero, it might say, "I
 shine without feeling, though not without a frame." But even then Mr. 
Fulsome's faith would have the pre-eminence; for if we credit him it 
shines without either frame or feeling. How absurd is Solifidianism? how
 dangerous! If any man can show me a true light, that actually emits no 
beams, I will repent of the ridicule I cast upon the dotages, which make
 way for a "justifying faith" that works by adultery and murder; an 
ill-smelling candle this, which burns in the breasts of apostates to the
 honour of him that kindled it at the fire of Tophet; an infernal 
candle, sending forth darkness instead of light, and so far benighting 
the good men who follow it, that they look upon it as the 
inextinguishable "candle of the Lord," and upon sincere obedience as a 
"jack o'lantern."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The preceding pages represent truth as the remedy 
and nourishment of our souls; and I have already observed, that as we 
cannot take food without the continual help of the God of nature, so we 
cannot receive the truth without the continual assistance of the God of 
grace; it being the first axiom of the Gospel, that all our sufficiency 
and ability to do any good are of God. Nevertheless, lest those who seek
 occasion against the truth, which they do not relish, should call the 
free grace I hold forth Pelagianism, I shall conclude this section by 
asserting, that if Christ were not "the Saviour of all men," and if we 
were entirely destitute of the gracious, evangelical "light that 
enlightens every man," and "helps our infirmities," we should be, with 
respect to saving truths, like people who either have no kind of food, 
or no appetite at all to their food; nay, like sick people that have an 
insurmountable aversion to a medicine and an irresistible longing for 
poison. But the saving "grace of God having appeared to all men," and 
having mercifully given us an evangelical capacity to receive the truth 
as it is revealed to us in the dispensation we are under, we may either 
put that truth from us, as the unbelieving Jews did, or welcome it, as 
Job and his friends, although not without difficulty: yea, such 
difficulty as forms the "trial of our faith," and makes it reasonable in
 God to bid us "choose life" rather than death, when truth and error, 
blessing and cursing, are set before us. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>The operative belief of the truth and the 
operative belief of a lie are the two roots that produce all our good 
and all our bad actions. An appeal to reason and matter of fact.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">No plant can grow without its root, and no moral 
action can spring into existence without its principle. When we do not 
dissemble, our principle of action is our prevalent persuasion, our 
predominant belief; a cordial, practical belief of the truth and 
rejection of a lie being always the principle of a good action; and a 
cordial, practical belief of a lie and rejection of the truth being 
always the principle of a bad action.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">That good works can have no origin but the belief 
of the truth will appear indubitable, if we trace them back to their 
sources. To fear, love, and obey God are undoubtedly good works; but can
 I do them without believing the truth, that is, without believing that 
God is, that he is to be feared, loved, and obeyed, and that it is my 
duty or privilege so to do? Again: that bad works can have no other 
origin but the belief of a lie will also appear evident if we follow 
them to their spring. To neglect and disobey God are certainly bad 
works; but can we do them without "believing a lie?<i>" </i>without 
being more or less persuaded that although it may not be our duty, yet, 
upon the whole, in our present circumstances, it will be for our 
advantage or credit to neglect God and to swim with the stream?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">May not the preceding argument concerning the 
importance of faith be confirmed by appeals to reason, experience, and 
matter of fact? Did not Eve stand in paradise so long as she forbore 
eating of the forbidden fruit? Did she not forbear eating so long as she
 believed the truth, that is, so long as she believed she should die if 
she ate of that fruit? Would she have sinned if she had not first 
believed a lie, yea, swallowed down a cluster of lies? "That she should 
not die; the fruit was as good as it was fair; it was to be desired to 
make one wise; she should be as God," &amp;c; were not these untruths, 
freely entertained in her heart, the causes of her committing the 
direful deed?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Why did Judas once forsake all to follow the 
indigent Jesus? Was it not because he believed it his real advantage so 
to do? And did he not so far believe the truth and show his faith by 
corresponding works? By and by the spirit of error suggested that he 
should be a loser by following and a gainer by betraying his Master. Was
 not this an infamous lie? When he had believed it, did not his heart 
become a nest for the old serpent, a throne for the father of lies? And 
did not our Lord speak the words of soberness and truth when he said to 
his disciples, "One of you hath a devil?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Why did Peter deny his dear Lord? Undoubtedly 
because in that fatal hour he believed that the Jews were more able and 
ready to fall upon and destroy him than Christ was to save and defend 
him. And was not this believing an untruth? When he had completed his 
crime, why<i> </i>did he go out to weep, and not to hang himself, like 
Judas? Was not because he admitted the truth again; believing that where
 sin had abounded grace might yet superabound; and that great as his 
crimes were, God's mercy and Christ's love were yet greater? Saving 
truths these which Judas could no longer believe, having "done [final] 
despite to the Spirit of truth, [who] leads, [not drags,] into the 
truth."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Why did David attack Goliah with undaunted 
courage? Was it not because he heartily believed that the Lord would not
 be insulted by that blaspheming monster, and would stand by any one 
that attacked him in the name of the God of Israel? A great truth this, 
through which he waxed valiant in fight, killed his gigantic adversary, 
and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Why did he afterward 
stain his righteous soul with atrocious crimes? Was it not because he 
practically, and therefore most cordially, believed a horrid untruth; 
namely, that the company of his neighbour's ewe lamb was preferable to 
the delights afforded by the Lamb of God? Why did he afterward repent? 
Was it not because he received the truth again; heartily believing that 
he had committed dreadful sins, and that he must repent or perish?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: why are men "lovers of the world more than 
lovers of God?" Is it not because they really believe that the world can
 make them happier than God? If I say, "I believe that God is preferable
 to the world," and do not seek my chief happiness in him, do not I 
deceive myself and tell a gross untruth? And while St. James charges me 
to show my faith by my works, does not St. John show himself a rational 
divine when he protests that "the truth is not in me?<i>" </i>Once more:
 why did Saul of Tarsus "breathe threatenings and slaughter" against 
Christ's members? Was it not because he believed the grand lie of his 
day, that is, that Christ was an impostor? And why did he afterward 
breathe nothing but fervent love to Christians and unextinguishable zeal
 for Christ's glory? Was it not because his inmost soul was penetrated 
with the force of this almighty truth, "Christ is the true Messiah; he 
loved me and gave himself for me?<i>"</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">From these and a thousand such observations upon the <i>conversion </i>of sinners and the <i>perversion </i>of
 saints, I draw the following consequences, which, I trust, will 
recommend themselves to the reason of every calm inquirer after truth.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I. To convert or pervert a man, you need only 
change his principle of action, his predominant practical belief of a 
damnable lie or of a saving truth. For if the spring be new, so 
undoubtedly will be the streams. If you have a new tree, you will 
infallibly have new fruit. If the rudder be truly turned, the ship will 
certainly take a new course.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. Truth is the heavenly seed that produces living
 faith; and living faith is the heavenly root that produces good works. 
Truth and faith, therefore, are at the bottom of every good work. To 
suppose them absent from a good work is to suppose that a good work can 
be void of sincerity and truth, and of course void of goodness. And is 
not this supposing a glaring absurdity? On the other hand, a lie is the 
hellish seed that produces unbelief; and unbelief is the hellish root 
that produces bad works. A lie and unbelief are then at the bottom of 
every bad work. To suppose them absent from a bad work, is to suppose 
that a bad work can be wrought in faith and in truth, which is as 
impossible as to do a good work in malice and wickedness.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">As the rise and fall of a good weather glass 
infallibly show the real, though as yet invisible alterations of the 
Atmosphere; so our rising from sin and our falling into sin surely 
evidence the secret, and perhaps unnoticed changes that happen in our 
faith, for the better or for the worse. For the whole of our words and 
actions, taken into connection with our views and tempers, are the 
certain result of our present faith or unbelief, and consequently the 
best marks that we please or displease God, according to the last and 
capital proposition of the Minutes.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. When there is "truth in the inward parts," 
there is faith also, it being as impossible to admit religious truths 
any other way but by faith, as it is to partake of the light any other 
way but by sight. Truth and faith tincture with goodness the most 
extraordinary actions. Thus Samuel cuts Agag in pieces before the Lord; 
St. Paul strikes Elymas with blindness; St. Peter strikes Ananias with 
sudden death; Phinehas [stabs] Zirnri and Cosbi through the body; 
Abraham offers Isaac in truth and faith; and "God counts these actions 
to them for righteousness to all generations for evermore." On the other
 hand, the actions that do not spring from truth and faith, be they ever
 so good in the eyes of men, are an abomination in the sight of God, who
 requires "truth in the inward parts." Thus King Saul offers a 
sacrifice; Judas pleads for the poor; the Pharisees make long prayers; 
Pilate washes his hands from the blood of Christ; and God reckons these 
works to them for sin to all generations for evermore.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. Some actions, such as the commission of 
adultery and of murder, can never be tinctured by truth and faith, 
because they have for their principle triumphant impurity, gross 
injustice, and flagrant unbelief; and whenever such sins prevail in the 
soul, the contrary virtues, holiness, truth, and faith are gone; just as
 when racking pains and a putrid fever prevail in the body, ease and 
health are there no more. To suppose, therefore, that living faith 
lurked in David's heart during his grievous apostasy, is as absurd as to
 suppose that health lurks in a body infected by the plague, and life in
 a corpse. "Ay, but David's faith, like that of Peter, was raised up 
again." True: and so was the body of Lazarus, that of our Lord, and that
 of the ruler's daughter: but is this a proof that Lazarus, Christ, and 
the damsel, did not undergo a real death? A concession, however, I 
cheerfully make to my objector; wishing that it may be a mean of 
reconciling him as much to the faith of St. James, as I am reconciled to
 that of St. Paul. If he grant me that Peter's and David's faith went 
out as really as a candle which is put under an extinguisher; I will 
grant him, that through the long suffering of God, who never seals the 
absolute reprobation of sinners so long as their day of visitation 
lasts, the extinct faith of those fallen saints was as an extinguished 
light, that continues to smoke, and can the sooner be lighted again. 
Their falls, great as they were, did not amount to complete obduracy and
 the sin against the Holy Ghost.- "He will not quench the smoking flax,"
 was a promise in which they were still interested with all those who 
have not yet done final "despite to the Spirit of grace." Free grace, 
therefore, visited them again; and when she put her candle to their 
hearts, they again knew their day; they welcomed the light; the smoking 
flax once more caught the pure flame of truth; and living faith, with 
her luminous train, was rekindled in their breasts. Thus, by improving 
what remained of the accepted time, they escaped the fate of Judas. who 
so hardened him-self, that his candle was put out in final darkness; 
they avoided the doom of the foolish virgins, who so procrastinated 
repentance, that their extinguished lamps were never lighted again. To 
return:-  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">6. As our pulses all over the body exactly answer 
to the beating of our heart; so our inward works, that is, our thoughts,
 desires, schemes, and tempers exactly answer to our faith or principle 
of action. I say "our inward works," because hypocrites can mimic all 
external works. How improperly then is St. Paul quoted against the works
 of faith! Does he not assure us himself that saving "faith worketh by 
love?<i>" </i>And is it not as absurd to oppose the works of faith to 
faith, as to oppose the pulses to the beating of the heart; no two 
things in the world being more strongly connected? However, as the heart
 always beats before the arteries, and as a cannon is always fired 
before the explosion can be heard, the ball felt, or the flame 
perceived; so faith always moves before it can set fear, hope, desire, 
or love in motion. And if godly fear, hope, desire, and love, which are 
our internal good works, always spring from faith; our external good 
works, such as publicly worshipping God, doing good to our neighbour, 
&amp;c, from a right principle and in a right manner, always flow from 
faith also. For our external works are nothing but the effects of the 
works which we have already wrought in our hearts; just as the rapid 
motion of a ball out of the cannon is nothing but the effect of the 
motion that was communicated to it, while it was yet IN the cannon.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">7. If every internal good work (suppose a sincere 
operative desire to love my enemy for God's sake) necessarily springs 
from a good principle, that is, from true faith; it follows, that, so 
long as I consistently continue in the same disposition, my principle of
 action is good, and I am (so far) a good man, according to the standard
 of one or another of the Gospel dispensations. On the other hand, if 
any one inward bad work (suppose a malicious desire to hurt my 
neighbour) springs from a bad principle, it follows also that, so long 
as I continue in that bad disposition, whatever degree of sanctity I may
 pretend to, my principle of action is bad, I am a wicked man of the 
Pharisaic or of the Antinomian order. To conclude:-  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">8. As by suppressing the beating of the heart you 
may stop all the pulses; so by suppressing the act of faith you may put a
 stop to all good works. On the other hand, as by cutting the main 
arteries you may put an end to the motion of the heart; so by 
suppressing the good motions caused by faith you may put an end to the 
life of faith, and destroy the new creature in Christ Jesus. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>The reasonableness of the doctrine of salvation
 by faith is farther evinced by a variety of arguments. How much we are 
indebted to the Solifidians for having firmly stood up in defence of 
faith. How dearly they have made us pay for that service, when they have
 so enforced our eleventh article, which guards salvation by faith, as 
to make void the twelfth, which guards morality: and why the 
overpowering splendour of truth is qualified by some shades.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">SHOULD some readers still think that it is 
unreasonable to dwell first upon faith, and to insist more upon it than 
upon the other works and graces which adorn the life and character of a 
Christian; to remove their scruples, and to vindicate more fully the 
fundamental doctrine of salvation by faith, I present them with the 
following remarks:-  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. If true faith is the root that produces hope, 
charity, and sincere obedience, as the preceding section evinces, is it 
not reasonable principally to urge the necessity of believing aright? 
The end of all preaching is undoubtedly to plant the tree of evangelical
 obedience; and how can that tree be planted but by its root? Was a 
gardener ever charged with unreasonableness, for not setting a tree by 
the branches?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. If faith working by love is the heart of true 
religion, should we not bestow our chief attention and care upon it? 
Suppose you were a physician, and attended a patient, who had an 
imposthume in his stomach and another on his hand; would you do honour 
to your skill, if overlooking the internal mischief you confined your 
attention to the external ulcer?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. The most excellent gift of God to man, next to 
the invaluable gifts of his Son and Spirit, is that of saving truth. 
Nay, the Son of God, in his prophetic character, came only to display 
the truth. He was manifested in the flesh to be its herald among men. 
St. Paul tells us that "Christ witnessed a good confession before 
Pilate;" and St. John informs us that part of this confession ran thus: 
"To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I
 should bear witness unto the truth." Now if "bearing witness to the 
truth" was a great "cause," and a peculiar "end" of our Lord's coming 
into the world; if the Spirit itself is called the "Spirit of truth," 
because his grand office is to reveal and seal the truth; if truth is no
 better than error to us, till we receive it by faith; and if the 
Scripture declares four times that "the just shall live by his faith," a
 declaration this which St. Paul confirms by his own experience, when he
 says, "I live by faith;" is it not evident that when we practically 
reject the doctrine of faith, we reject life, together with all the 
blessings which are "brought to light by the Gospel;" a Gospel 
disbelieved being undoubtedly a Gospel rejected?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. Our feelings and conduct greatly depend upon 
our apprehensions of things. A false report that your son is dead 
reaches your ears; you believe it, and pangs of grief distract your 
breast. Soon after a true account of his being drowned is brought to 
you; you disbelieve it, and you remain unaffected. A diamond by 
moonlight glitters at your feet; you think it is only a glow worm, and 
this mistake prevents your stooping to pick it up. A glow worm shines at
 some distance; you fancy that it is a diamond, and you run to it with a
 degree of hope and joy proportionable to the degree of your vain 
confidence. The God of truth is an infinite, spiritual diamond, if I may
 use the expression; and. yet so faint are our ideas of his excellence 
that we overlook him, and madly run after deceitful objects, the 
brightest of which are but glow worms to the "Father of lights." 
Nothing, therefore, but a firm "belief of the truth," stamping our souls
 with just apprehensions of things, and fixing in us a strong persuasion
 of their intrinsic worth or vanity, can rectify our judgment, and make 
us regulate our conduct according to the dictates of God's word, which 
are invariably one with the truth, and with the nature of things.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. When St. Paul exhorts his converts to the 
pursuit of things. "honest, just, pure, lovely," &amp;c, he mentions 
first, with great propriety, "whatsoever things are true." For as soon 
as obedient faith allows truth to sit upon the throne, there is an end 
of mental anarchy: all things resume their proper ranks and places. 
Creatures, in a great degree, disappear before their Creator; earth 
before heaven; and time before eternity. Thus Satan's charm is broken, 
God begins to be to us what he is in himself, "all in all;" and when we 
see him such, if our faith be lively and practical, we treat him as 
such: we answer the end of our creation: truth prevails: "Satan falls as
 lightning from heaven:" man is man, and God is God.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">6. A truth, next to God, is the most powerful 
thing in the world; if we can have no communion with God but by the 
medium of truth; if falsehood is the rankest poison in hell; and if we 
take a draught of this poison as often as we take in a capital religious
 error; can you reasonably explode the doctrine of salvation by faith, 
since the office of living faith is to expel the poison of destructive 
error, and to receive the reviving, healing, strengthening cordial of 
Gospel truth?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">7. If an unfeigned faith in the truths which God 
reveals under one or another of his evangelical dispensations is the 
instrumental cause of all our good works, while a cordial consent to one
 or more of Satan's lies is the parent of all our bad actions; if these 
two springs move every wheel of righteousness and of iniquity in the 
world; is it not highly consistent with reason to mind them first? Would
 you not pity your watch maker if he so regarded the hand and dial plate
 of your watch as to forget the wheel work and spring? And can you 
approve the method of Honestus, who insists upon good works, without 
ever touching upon the principles of sincere obedience, and upon faith, 
which is the spring that sets all in motion?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">8. Again: if Abraham, by "not staggering at the 
promise of God through unbelief, and by being strong in faith, gave 
glory to God," and "set to his seal that God is true;" if you cannot 
honour a superior more than by receiving his every word with respectful 
confidence, and moving at his every beck with obedient alacrity; and if 
faith thus honours God, why should you refuse it the first place among 
the graces which support and adorn the Church militant? Especially since
 the Lord declares that "the pure in heart shall see God," and that our 
"hearts are purified by faith;" and since the Scriptures testify that 
"without holiness no man shall see life and that we "are sanctified 
through faith that is in him."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">9. All fullness dwells in God; creatures, 
abstracted from the Divine plenitude, are mere emptiness. Rational 
creatures, in their most perfect state, are only moral vessels, filled 
with the grace of God, and reflecting the light of Divine truth. Now if 
we can be saved any other way than "by grace through [obedient] faith," 
that is, by freely receiving the grace and light of God, through the 
practical belief of the truth proposed to us; if we are in any degree 
saved by our proper merit through faithless works; we may indulge 
Pharisaic boasting. But God does not so give his glory to human worms; 
therefore such a boasting is excluded by the law of faith; and the 
apostle wisely observes that salvation "is of faith, that it may be by 
grace;" the justifying faith of sinners always implying a cordial 
acknowledgment of their sin and misery, and a hearty recourse to "the 
tender mercy of our God, whereby the day spring from on high hath 
visited us," more or less clearly, according to the dispensation we are 
under.*  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To establish the doctrine of the Gospel 
dispensations; to show that saving truth, in its various manifestations,
 is the object of saving faith; I need only prove, that a man, in order 
to his salvation, is bound to believe at one time what he was not bound 
to believe at another. Take one instance out of many. If St. Peter had 
died just after he had been pronounced "blessed," for acknowledging that
 our Lord was "the Son of God," he could not have been cursed with a 
"Depart from me," &amp;c. He would have been saved; and in that case he 
would have obtained salvation without believing one tittle about our 
Lord's resurrection, and might I not also say about his crucifixion? 
And, nevertheless, St. Paul, a few years after, justly represented that 
article as essential to the salvation of those to whom it is revealed! 
"IF thou shalt BELIEVE with thy heart that God HATH RAISED the Lord 
Jesus from the dead, thou shalt be saved," Rom. x, 9. Few people, I 
think, can read the Acts of the Apostles without seeing, that the 
numerous conversions wrought by St. Peter's preaching were wrought by 
the force of this truth, "God has raised up that Jesus whom you have 
crucified." A victorious truth this, which would have been a gross 
untruth three months before the day of pentecost. Nay, what is at one 
time an article of saving faith, may at another time become an article 
of the most confirmed unbelief. Thus the expectation of the Messiah, 
which was a capital article of the faith of the ancient Israelites, is 
now the buttress of the Babel of modern Jews. The property of faith is 
then to make our hearts bow to the truth as it is manifested to us; it 
being evident that God never blamed the children of men for not 
believing what was never revealed to them.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">MEMORANDUM.-In page 534, I have said that "the 
genuine seed of the word is always good, always full of Divine energy." I
 desire the candid reader to read the following lines, as more 
particularly expressive of my meaning:- The word is [τauτπ:] and truth, 
like the sun, is always efficacious where its light penetrates. But I 
would by no means insinuate that the truth may not, like the sun, shine 
more brightly and powerfully at one time than at another; the word of 
truth, however, [always] performs, though more or less sensibly, that 
whereunto God sends it; being always a "savour of life unto life to them
 that believe," or of "death unto death" to willful unbelievers, 
according to the grand decree of conditional election and reprobation 
"He that believeth, &amp;c, shall be saved; and he that believeth not 
shall be damned."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">10. The manner in which faith and its works 
"exclude boasting," may be illustrated by a comparison. A beggar lies 
dying at your door, you offer him a cordial, he takes it, revives, and 
works. A deserter is going to be shot, you bring him a pardon from the 
king, if he will receive it with grateful humility; he does so, joins 
his regiment, and fights with such courage that he is promoted. Now, in 
these cases, it is evident that Pharisaic* boasting is excluded. If the 
beggar live ever so long, and work ever so hard,-if the deserter fight 
ever so manfully, and be raised ever so high; yet they can never say 
that their doings have procured them the life which they enjoy; for, 
before they did such works, that life was graciously given, or restored 
to them, upon the easy terms of confidently taking a remedy, and humbly 
accepting a pardon offered: The application is easy. By our fallen 
nature we are "conceived in sin, and children of wrath:" God freely 
gives us the light of life in Jesus Christ; faith, without necessity, 
humbly receives it, and works by it; the believer therefore, can never 
be so unreasonable and ungrateful as to suppose that his working merited
 him "the light of life," by which he began to work righteousness. So 
long as he deserves the name of a believer, he knows, he feels, that his
 faith is, in the first place, a mere receiver. "What hast thou that 
thou hast not received?" roars like thunder in the ears of a lively 
faith, and like lightning strikes dead the Pharisaic boast.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* There is an evangelical boasting which St. Paul recommends to others, and indulges himself. See note, p. 504.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">II. I say that "faith is, in the first place, a 
mere receiver." This deserves attention. If we consider faith as a 
conduit pipe, which at one end receives the truth and power of God, and 
at the other end refunds those living streams to water the garden of the
 Lord; we may with propriety compare that mother grace to the pipe of a 
watering pot, which at the internal, unseen opening, receives the water 
that is in the pot; and at the external, visible perforations, returns 
it and forms artificial showers over the drooping plants. According to 
the doctrine of grace, maintained by the Solifidians, faith does nothing
 but receive the grace of God through Christ; and according to the 
doctrine of works, maintained by the moralists, faith is a mere 
bestower; but, according to the Gospel of Christ, which embraces and 
connects the two extremes of truth, faith is first an humble, passive 
receiver, and then a cheerful, active bestower: it receives grace and 
truth, and returns love and good works. In that respect, it resembles 
the heart which continually receives the blood from the veins, and 
returns it into the arteries. If the heart cease either to receive or to
 return the blood, (no matter which,) its motion and our animal life are
 soon at an end; and if faith cease either to receive grace, or to 
return good works, its motion and its life soon terminate in spiritual 
death, according to the doctrine of St. James. If the Solifidians and 
moralists candidly looked at faith in this rational and Scriptural 
light, they would soon embrace the whole Gospel, and one another. By 
considering faith as a receiver, according to the first Gospel axiom, 
Honestus would avoid the Pharisaic extreme; and by viewing it as a 
bestower, according to the second Gospel axiom, Zelotes would avoid the 
Antinominan delusion; and both would jointly recommend the humble, 
cheerful, consistent passiveness and activity of Bible believers.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">12. "If we receive the witness of men," says St. 
John, "the witness of God is greater: for [under the Christian 
dispensation] this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his 
Son: he that believeth on the Son of God hath the testimony in himself; 
but he that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believed 
not the record that God gave of his Son." Upon these awful words I raise
 the following argument:- If a state of absolute doubt is quite 
unnatural: if it is almost impossible to keep the balance of our 
judgment unturned for one hour, with respect to all saving truths and 
destructive lies: if the stream of life, which hurries us along, calls 
us every moment to action: if we continually do good or bad works: if 
good works certainly spring from saving faith, and bad works from 
destructive unbelief: if skeptics are only so in imagination, theory, 
and profession: if our daily conduct demonstrates whether our heart 
inclines most to the lies of Satan, or to the truths of God: and if the 
moment we practically reject God's truths, we embrace the lies of the 
god of this world, and by that means take him for our god;-if, I say, 
this is the case, what reasonable man can be surprised to bear the mild 
Jesus say, "He that believeth not shall be damned?" Can there be a 
greater sin-a sin more productive of all iniquity, and more horrid, than
 to make the lying devil a god, and the true God a liar? Nevertheless, 
dreadful to say! this double crime is actually committed by all that 
live in willful, practical unbelief; and the commission of it is 
indirectly recommended by all those who decry the doctrine of salvation 
by faith.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Lastly. If our first parents fell by believing the
 gross lies told them by the serpent, is God unreasonable to raise us, 
by making us believe the great truths peculiar to our dispensation, that
 the Divine leaven of sincerity and truth may counterwork and at last 
expel the satanic leaven of malice and wickedness? Who ever thought it 
absurd in a physician to proportion the remedy to the disease, the 
antidote to the poison? And why should even the incarnation of the Son 
of God appear a mean too wonderful for an end so important? Why should 
it he thought incredible that the Son of God, who, as our Creator, is 
far more nearly related to us than our natural parents, should have 
graciously stooped as low as the human nature to redeem us; when Satan 
wantonly stooped as low as the beastly nature to tempt us? On the 
contrary, is it not absurd to suppose that hellish, wanton malice has 
done more to destroy, than heavenly, creating love to save the children 
of men? For my part, the more I compare the genuine Gospel with the 
nature of things, the more I admire their harmony; wondering equally at 
the prejudices of those hasty professors who pour perpetual contempt 
upon reason, to keep their irrational opinions in countenance; and at 
the unreasonableness of those pretended votaries of reason, who suppose 
that the doctrine of salvation by faith is incompatible with good sense.
  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">OBJECTION. "But," says an objector, "if unfeigned 
faith, or a cordial belief of the truth, instrumentally turns us 'from 
the power of Satan to God;' why have you published tracts against the 
Solifidians whose favourite doctrine is, 'Believe; he that believeth 
hath everlasting life?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ANSWER. By the preceding pages it is evident that 
we do not differ from the Solifidians when they preach salvation by 
faith in a rational and a Scriptural manner. So long at they do this, we
 wish them good luck in the name of the Lord. Nay, I publicly return 
them my sincere thanks for the bold stand they have made for faith, when
 the floods of Pharisaic ungodliness lifted up their voice against that 
mother grace, and threatened to destroy her with all her offspring. But,
 alas! how dear have they made us pay for that service, when they have 
asserted or insinuated that true faith is inadmissible, that it can live
 in a heart totally depraved, that a man's faith can be good when his 
actions are bad, detestable, diabolical; in a word, that true Christians
 may go any length in sin, may plunge into adultery, murder, or incest, 
and even proceed to the open worship of devils, like [Solomon], without 
losing their title to a throne of glory, and their justifying, 
sanctifying, saving faith!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">This they have done in flat opposition to our 
Lord's doctrine: "A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither 
does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit; for every tree is known by 
its own fruit," Luke vi, 43. And this some of them seem determined to 
do, to the stumbling of the judicious, the deceiving of the simple, and 
the hardening of infidels; notwithstanding our twelfth article, which 
strongly guards the doctrine of faith against their Solifidian error. 
"Good works" says our Church in that truly anti-Calvinistic article, "do
 [at this present time] spring out necessarily of a true and lively 
faith, [and consequently bad works, of a false and dead faith;] insomuch
 that by them a lively [and by bad works a dead] faith may be as 
evidently known, as a tree is discerned by the fruit."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But, in the meantime, how do they evade the force 
of that article? Why, thus: David bears this year the fruit of adultery,
 hypocrisy, treachery, and murder, before all his kingdom: last year he 
bore the fruit of chastity, sincerity, truth, and brotherly love. 
However, according to the Crispian doctrines of grace, David must be a 
tree of righteousness now, as much as when he bore the fruits of 
righteousness. If this be not the case, Mr. Fulsome's Gospel will be 
false: now this must not be. That Gospel must stand. "But if it stand, 
our twelfth article falls to the ground." O! we can prop it by saying, 
that though a child of God, a tree of righteousness, may now produce 
adultery, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c, yet he will certainly produce good 
fruit again by and by. To this salvo I answer, that the article has only
 two grand designs; the one inseparably to connect a lively faith and 
good works, and the other to indicate the manner in which I may know 
whether I have a lively or a dead faith. Now, if I may have a lively 
faith while I commit adultery, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c, it evidently 
follows, (1.) That the necessary connection between a lively faith and 
good works is totally lost. (2.) That adultery and murder may denote a 
lively faith as well as purity and love. And, (3.) That our twelfth 
article has not even the worth of a nose of wax, and may be burned with 
St. James' Epistle, as an article "of straw." And yet these gentlemen 
are the persons that represent themselves as the only fair subscribers 
to our articles, and charge us with prevarication for taking the 
seventeenth article in connection with the sixth, the twelfth, the 
sixteenth, and the thirty-first, as well as with the latter part of that
 article itself, which demands that the election it speaks of be 
understood of conditional election!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To return. Should the reader object, that "if God 
had suspended our salvation upon our practical belief of the truth, he 
would have put so conspicuous a badge upon the saving truth peculiar to 
each dispensation that nobody could have Antinomian error, enthusiasm, 
priest-craft, or nonsense:" I answer-  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. God, having decreed to prove the loyalty and 
moral sagacity of his rational creatures, could not but place them in 
circumstances in which they might have an opportunity of exerting 
themselves. If hares were chained at the doors of dog kennels, what 
sagacity could hounds manifest above mastiffs? And if the deepest truths
 always lay within the reach of the most besotted souls, what advantage 
would candid, diligent inquirers have over those who wrap their minds in
 the veil of prejudice, and stupidly compose themselves to sleep in the 
arms of ignorance and sloth?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. God will reward us according to our works of 
faith; but if the truth were attended with an irresistible energy, if it
 shone always upon our minds as transcendently bright as the dazzling 
sun does sometimes upon our faces, would God display his wisdom in 
rewarding us for confessing it? Did he, did any man in his senses, ever 
offer to reward us for believing that a bright luminary rules the day, 
when its meridian glory overpowers our sight?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. Pearls are found in the bottom of the sea. Gold
 and diamonds lie generally deep in the earth. We sink pits to a 
prodigious depth only to come at the black mineral which we burn. 
Thousands of men go as far as the East and West Indies to fill our 
canisters with tea and sugar. Our meanest tradesmen sip the dews of both
 hemispheres at a breakfast. And yet, it may be, with a dish of tea in 
our hand, and a gold ring on our finger, we gravely complain that saving
 truth lies a great way off and that God is unjust in placing it in 
obscure mines, which cannot be worked without some trouble and industry.
  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. But although nobody can be established in the 
truth without "labouring for the meat that endureth for everlasting 
life;" yet God's terms of salvation are not so hard as some prejudiced 
people conceive. Nor do I scruple to assert, that if we could read the 
hearts of all men, we would see, that, for a time, unbelievers take as 
much pains to exclude the light of truth as believers do to welcome it, 
and that wicked men work as intensely, though not as intentionally, to 
make their reprobation and damnation certain, as good men do "to make 
their calling and election sure:" for "the wicked is snared in the work 
of his own hands. The reward of his hands shall be given him. The wages 
of [his] sin is death; [and he frequently toils like a horse for his 
wages,] drawing iniquity with cords of vanity, [and] sin as with a cart 
rope," to hale himself and others into the burning lake.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">From the preceding answers I conclude, that God, 
who makes the golden light of the sun and the silver light of the moon 
succeed each other, and who wisely tempers the blaze of a summer's day 
by the mildness of the starry night, with equal wisdom qualifies the 
blaze of the day of truth by the mild obscurity of a night of probation;
 not only that the flaming truth may be more delightful at its return, 
but also that there may be room left for a gentle trial of our faith, 
and for the reasonable rewardableness of our works of faith. <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>Inferences.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">l. If faith be so closely connected with truth, 
present salvation with faith, and eternal salvation with the works of 
faith, how injudicious are those gentlemen, who assert that principles 
are nothing, and that it little matters what doctrines we hold, provided
 our actions be good! Alas! if our leading principles be wrong, how can 
our actions be right? If we be men of no principles, or of bad 
principles, and do seemingly good actions, do we not do them from bad, 
Pharisaical motives? Even when such actions appear good to man, who 
judges according to appearance, are they not evil before the Searcher of
 hearts? Are they not detestable before the Examinator of principles? 
Undoubtedly; hypocrisy being the most odious sort of iniquity in the 
sight of Him who "requires truth in the inward parts."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. If the effects of truth be so wonderful, and if
 the pure word of God be essentially one with truth, how fatal is the 
mistake of the laymen who slight the Gospel word! who listen to a sermon
 with less attention than they do to a play! and who read the Scriptures
 with less eagerness than they do the newspapers! And how culpable are 
those clergymen who preach the first sermon they set their hand upon, 
without examining whether it contain truth or error, or a mixture of 
both; at least, without considering whether it be adapted to the 
capacity and circumstances of their hearers!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. Can we decry prejudice too much, if it unfit 
our souls for receiving the truth, as trash unfits our stomachs for 
receiving proper food? Should not a narrow, bigoted spirit, that 
collects itself like a hedgehog in its own fancied orthodoxy, and 
bristles up assertions and invectives instead of arguments, be firmly 
opposed by every generous inquirer after truth? Can we deplore too much 
the case of those sanguine persons, who judge of the strength of their 
faith by the force of their prepossession; and who fancy that a hundred 
plain scriptures, and as many cogent arguments, have no weight, if they 
do not countenance their favourite sentiments and misunderstood 
feelings? And can we too warmly recommend a candid, sober, fearless turn
 of mind, which lays us open to information, and disposes us publicly to
 espouse the cause of truth, even when destruction threatens her, and 
her despised adherents?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. "Charity rejoiceth in the truth;" and "though I
 speak with the tongues of angels," says St. Paul, "if I have not 
charity," that is, if I do not "rejoice in the truth," whether it makes 
for or against my prejudices, "I am become as sounding brass." Upon this
 footing what can we say of those warm moralists, who, in their zeal for
 works, are ready to burn against the doctrine of faith? What of those 
rash Solifidians who, in their zeal for faith, are ready to lay down 
their lives against the doctrine of works? Alas! like St. Paul in the 
days of his ignorance, they court and yet persecute the truth; they 
embrace and yet stab the Divine stranger. These false martyrs may give 
their body to be burned for one truth against another; but God will say 
to them, "Who required this at your hands?" and they themselves will 
say, "It profiteth us nothing."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">5. If there be various forms in the school of 
truth, how unreasonable is it to say that none have any acquaintance 
with her, but such as are in one of the highest forms! And if the temple
 of truth has various divisions to which we advance, as we go on "from 
faith to faith," how cruel is it to consign over to damnation the 
sincere souls who have yet got no farther than the porch!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">6. If there are as many sorts of religious truths 
as there are of nourishing food, how irrational is it to despise those 
truths which the apostle compares to milk, merely because they are not 
the truths which he calls "strong meat!" On the other hand, if we cannot
 yet receive those strong truths, how rash are we, if we represent them 
as chaff or poison! And what mischief is done in the Church of Christ by
 those who deal in palpable absurdities, and in errors demonstrated to 
be of a stupifying or intoxicating nature; especially if they retail 
such errors to an injudicious, credulous populace, under the name of 
"rich honey" and" Gospel marrow!"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">7. If Divine truth is one through its various 
appearances, and if "the light of the righteous [who holds on his way] 
shines more and more unto the perfect day;" what shall we say of those 
prejudiced men, who oppose the truth with all their might, merely 
because it does not come up to their false standard, or because it 
appears in a dress to which they are not accustomed? Did a Persian ever 
refuse to admire the <i>rising </i>sun, because it was not the <i>meridian </i>sun,
 or laugh at it as being an insignificant meteor, because it rose under a
 cloud? If Christ is not ashamed to call himself "the light" and "the 
truth," should we be ashamed to confess him in his lowest appearances? 
If Christ, exalted at the right hand of God, is one with Christ 
transfigured on the mount,-bleeding on Calvary,-lying in the 
manger,-confined, a helpless embryo, in the virgin's womb; may not the 
triumphant truth that shines like the sun in the heart of a "father in 
Christ," have some affinity with the spark that glows in the heart of an
 infant in grace under the dispensation of Noah? Ought we to give up the
 greatest part of our neighbours as men that "never had grace," when the
 Scripture expressly declares, that "the saving grace of God has 
appeared unto all men," and that Christ is "the light of the world that 
enlightens every man?" Let mystical Herods seek the young child's life; 
but thou, man of God, leap for joy, like the unborn Baptist, before the 
least and feeblest appearance of thy Lord. Instead of calling it "common
 grace," that thou mayest cut it off the next moment as "no grace," 
cherish it as saving grace in thy own breast, and in the hearts of all 
that are around thee.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">8. If the most powerful displays of truth improve 
its feeblest appearances, without ever contradicting them, how mistaken 
are the men who impose upon us the immoral doctrines of the Antinomians,
 and the unevangelical doctrines of the Pharisees! When we have once 
admitted that "there is a holy God, who makes a difference between the 
just and the unjust," can we, without renouncing that truth, become 
Antinomians, and think that a man, who actually defiles his neighbour's 
wife, can be "a man after God's own heart?" And when we have been taught
 our second gracious lesson, namely, that "we are miserable sinners," 
can we, without renouncing this principle, suppose that we can be saved 
any other way than by the covenant of grace and mercy? Away, then, for 
ever away with Antinomian and Pharisaic delusions, which are built upon 
the ruins of these two capital truths, "God is holy," and "man is 
sinful!"  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION X. <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>An address to baptized heathens.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">HERE I would take leave of my readers; but they 
have consciences as well as reason, and therefore I beg leave to address
 the former of those powers, as bluntly as I have done the latter; 
diversifying my expostulations according to the different cases of the 
persons, into whose hands Providence may direct these sheets.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. If you do not make the bulk of my readers, I 
fear you make the bulk of the nation, O ye that regard pleasure, profit,
 and honour, more than justice, mercy, and the fear of God; ye that, far
 from embracing Divine truth at the hazard of your character, spread 
abroad scandalous untruths, to the ruin of other people's reputations: 
ye who try to persuade yourselves, that religion is nothing but a 
monstrous compound of superstition, enthusiasm, and priestcraft: ye who 
can violate the laws of temperance or honesty without one painful 
remorse; breaking through promises, oaths, and matrimonial or 
sacramental engagements, as if there were no future state, no supreme 
Judge, no day of retribution, no Divine law enacting that "whosoever 
loveth or maketh a lie shall be cast into the lake of fire; that the 
wicked shall be turned into hell, with all the people that forget God:<i>" </i>ye
 are the persons that I beg leave to call baptized heathens. Baptismal 
water was applied to your bodies, as a figure of the grace which 
purifies believing souls. Ye received, and continue to bear, a Christian
 name, that binds upon you the strongest obligations you can possibly be
 under, to partake of Christ's holiness, and to lead a sober, Christian 
life: but how opposite is your conduct to that of Christ! Alas! 
conscientious heathens would disown you; and shall God own you? Shall 
the Searcher of hearts forgive your immorality, in consideration of your
 hypocrisy? Will you live and die with such a lie in your right hand and
 upon your forehead? God forbid! If you have not sold yourselves to the 
father of deceits for ever, pay yet some attention to natural, moral, 
and evangelical truths. They recommend themselves to your senses, your 
reason, and your conscience.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. Regard natural truths. Earthly joys vanish like
 dreams. Life flies like an arrow. Your friends or neighbours are daily 
seized by sickness, and dragged into eternity. Death comes to terminate'
 your delusions, and set his black seal upon your false lips, your 
wanton eyes, your rapacious hands, your luxurious palates, your sinful, 
treacherous breasts. Ere long the king of terrors will screw you down in
 his hard couch, a coffin: he will convey you away in his black 
carriage, a hearse: he will confine you to his loathsome dungeon, a 
grave; and there he will keep you in chains of darkness and corruption, 
till the trump of God summon you to judgment.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. And say not that the doctrine of a day of 
judgment is a fable. If you do, I appeal to moral truths. Is there not 
an essential difference between truth and falsehood, between mercy and 
cruelty, between honesty and villany? Have you, with all the pains you 
have taken about it, been able to erase from your breasts the law of 
truth and mercy, which the righteous God has deeply engraven there? Is 
there not something within you, that, bad as you are, forbids you to 
wish your father dead, that you may have his estate; and your wife 
poisoned, that you may marry the woman you love? If you say that these 
are only prejudices of education; I ask, How come these prejudices to be
 universal? Why are they the same, even where the methods of education 
are most contrary? Why do they reign in the very countries where there 
are neither magistrates nor priests; and where of course politics and 
priestcraft never bore the sway? If your consciences would condemn you 
for the above-mentioned crimes; how much more will God do it, who is the
 Author and Judge of your consciences? Does not your good sense tell 
you, that so sure as the wonderful machine of this world did not make, 
and does not preserve itself, there is a God who made and preserves it? 
And that this God is possessed of ten thousand times more truth, equity,
 impartiality, justice, and power, than all the righteous rulers in the 
world were ever endued with? And, to say nothing of the gracious checks 
and sad forebodings of your guilty consciences, does not your reason 
discover, that as certainly as this great God is possessed of infinite 
wisdom, power, and justice; and has given us a moral law, he will call 
us to an account for our breaches of it; and that, as he does not in 
general do it in this world, he will infallibly do it in a future state?
  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. If reason and conscience thus lead you to 
religion; regard religious truths. They are supported by so great a 
variety of well attested facts, by such clouds of righteous witnesses, 
by so many astonishing miracles and accomplished prophecies:- they so 
perfectly agree with the glory of our Creator, the interests of mankind,
 the laws of our nature, and the native desire we have for immortality: 
they so exactly coincide with our present, as well as future happiness, 
that you cannot expose your unreasonableness more, and do yourselves 
greater injury, than by rejecting them.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">What reasonable objection can you make to these 
Scriptural directions? "Cease to do evil. Learn to do good. Speak the 
truth in love. Return to the Lord. Call upon his name." Say, "Grant to 
us in this world the knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come 
life everlasting." Confess yourselves sinners, great sinners: spread 
this melancholy truth before the throne of Divine mercy;-spread it with 
tears of undissembled repentance: "Except you repent, you shall all 
perish:<i>" </i>but if you "sow in tears, you shall reap in joy."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">And suppose not that I want to drive you to 
despair. On the contrary, I declare that, dangerous as your case is, it 
is not absolutely desperate. The Gospel offers you a remedy. You have 
dealt with lying shadows, but you may yet embrace the eternal substance.
 You have wounded the truth; but Christ, from whom you have the name of 
Christian,-Christ, who says, "I am the truth," has been wounded for you.
 You have crucified revealed truth, and the Prince of life has been 
crucified in your place. I point you to his cross, and declare, in the 
name of unprejudiced reason, that few histories are supported by such a 
variety of indisputable evidences as the wonders that redeeming love 
wrought on Calvary for you.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Let not the scandalous falls of apostates, and the
 bad lives of hypocritical Christians, frighten you from the Gospel. 
Immoral and unloving men, high as their pretensions to faith may be, are
 no more Christians than you. Suffer not the disputes of professors to 
keep you in infidelity; for they prove the truth, and not the falsehood 
of Christianity; being expressly foretold, Acts xx, 30; 1 Cor. xi, 19; 
Jude 4; 1 Tim. iv, 1. Nor stupidly wonder that the serpent should most 
spitefully bruise the heel of the truth that most powerfully bruises his
 head. Above all, be candid; be inquisitive.; apply to the "Father of 
lights" for direction; and his invisible hand will conduct you over 
every rock of offence, and lead you to the sure foundation, "the Rock of
 ages, the truth as it is in Jesus."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">How near is that truth to you! It always embraces 
mercy, and mercy now embraces you. O! the length and breadth, the depth 
and height of redeeming mercy! It spares you to believe, to repent, to 
live. The arms of Divine patience still encircle your guilty souls, and 
bear up your mortal bodies above the terrors of the grave. Crying as 
your sins are, the cries of your Saviour's blood are yet heard above 
them. Provoking as your unbelief is, it has not yet provoked God to set 
upon you the seal of absolute reprobation. Unspotted holiness, glorious 
majesty, flaming power, thundering justice, weeping mercy, bleeding 
love;-all the Divine attributes join yet in a concert of grace and 
truth. You are the objects of it; and the burthen of their terrifying, 
melting accents is, "Turn ye, turn ye: why will ye die, O house of 
Israel?" Why should "iniquity be your ruin? Turn! for I have redeemed 
you. Turn! and the second death shall have no power over you." Turn! and
 you "shall have a crown of life."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Thus, my dear fellow sinners, and far more 
earnestly than I can describe, mercy and truth exert themselves in your 
behalf; waiting only for your consent, to diffuse their Divine perfumes 
through your converted souls. This is "the day of God's power"-your 
Gospel day. This is "a day of salvation," a day of spiritual jubilee, a 
day of "the year of release." Know it: improve it: break your bonds: 
claim your liberty: change your service: scorn to be the devil's 
drudges: become the servants of the Most High. Regard neither the husks 
nor the grunts of the swine: the heavenly feast is before you: the 
Father of the prodigal son runs to meet, to forgive, to welcome, to 
embrace you; and to raise your doubting hearts, he bids me impress these
 gracious promises upon your yielding breasts: "When the wicked man 
turneth away from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and 
right, [and what is more lawful and right for sinners, than to repent, 
believe, and obey the Gospel?] he shall save his soul alive. Let the 
wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let 
him return unto the Lord, for he is merciful; and to our God, for he 
will abundantly pardon." <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>An address to Christianized Jews</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">AND ye, Christianized Jews, will you still be 
offended at our sincerely preaching free grace to all our fellow 
Gentiles? Will you still stop your ears and cry out, "The children of 
Abraham, the temple of the Lord are we?" Or, in other terms, we are the 
little flock necessarily contradistinguished from the immense herd of 
absolute reprobates. Will ye still assert, <i>Reprobos ideo in hanc 
pravitalem addicios, qiiiajuslo et inscrutabili. Dei judicio siiscitati 
sunt ad gloriam ejus sua damnatione illustrandam: </i>"That the 
reprobates are devoted to wickedness, because, through the just and 
unsearchable judgment of God, they were raised up to illustrate his 
glory by their damnation?" Will ye still add, <i>Quos vero dainnationi 
addicil, his justo quidem el irrepre!iensibili, sed incomprehensibili 
ejus judicio, ntis aditum prisckidi. </i>"That by God's just and 
irreprehensible, though incomprehensible judgment, the way to life is 
blocked up for those whom he has devoted to damnation?" Will ye never 
blush to intimate, <i>Quos ergo Aens prirlerit, repro hat. N'eque alia 
causa, nisi quod ab hcsreditate, quam Jiliis suis prisdestinal, illos 
vult exeludere: </i>"Therefore those whom God passes by, he reprobates, 
for no other reason but this; he will exclude them from the inheritance 
which he predestinates for his Sons?" * Will ye still call "blind" all 
who think that God is sincerely loving to every man, without any 
exception, in the day of salvation? Will ye still monopolize "the light 
that enlightens every man who comes into the world?" Will ye still sound
 the bottomless abyss of Divine mercy with your short line, and judge of
 the Almighty's enlarged heart by the narrowness of your own? O learn to
 know the God of love, the God of truth better. "He is not willing that 
any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He commands 
all men every where to repent:<i>" </i>and he bids us "account his long 
suffering salvation; [assuring us that] the riches of his goodness, and 
forbearance, and long suffering lead to repentance [even those wretches 
who,] after their hardness and impenitent hearts, treasure up unto 
themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of his 
righteous judgment." <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>* </i>These three quotations are taken from Calvin's Institutes, Third Book, chap. 24, ace. 14; chap. 21, sec. 7; chap. 23, sec. 1.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If you will not credit God's <i>word, </i>pay at least some regard to his <i>oath. </i>"As
 I LIVE," says he, "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but 
that he turn from his way and live." Just as if he had said, "By myself I
 swear that I have absolutely reprobated no man. If any perish, their 
destruction is of themselves, and not of merciless decrees rashly 
imputed to my sovereignty. Free agency in man, and not free wrath in me,
 sinks those who make their conditional rejection and reprobation sure 
by their <i>unnecessary </i>unbelief and <i>avoidable </i>impenitency. 
Far from delighting absolutely in the reprobation of any one sinner, I 
solemnly protest that I would offer violence to the liberty of the most 
obstinate, and force them all into heaven by the exertion of my 
omnipotence, if my truth as a lawgiver, my justice as a judge, my 
veracity as the inspirer of my prophets, my wisdom as a rewarder, and my
 equity as a punisher, did not absolutely forbid it."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Come then, my prepossessed brethren, show 
yourselves "the children of Abraham:" return to the God of your 
father,-the God by whom "ALL the families of the earth may be blessed in
 the seed" of Abraham. Think not that the Lord is only jealous of his 
supreme dominion; nor make him <i>graceless </i>and <i>merciless </i>toward countless myriads of reprobated infants, to extol the <i>grim sovereigniy </i>which your imagination has set up.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Set not at odds Heaven's jarring attributes; Nor, with one excellence, another wound.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Allow God to be "all over, consummate, absolute, full orb'd, in his whole round of rays complete." <i>Merciful </i>in the day of salvation, and <i>just </i>in
 the day of judgment, to every individual of the human race. What can 
you possibly object to a doctrine so rational, so Scriptural, so worthy 
of God!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If you complain that we make the way to heaven too
 broad, I ask, ought we not to represent it as broad as the Scriptures 
make it? Do we make it wider than St. Peter did when truth and love made
 him divest himself of his Jewish prejudices, and cry out with pleasing 
amaze, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but 
in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is 
accepted of him?" Or do we make it narrower than St. Paul, when he 
wrote: "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: no adulterer, &amp;c, 
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">For your own credit do not ask, "If all men may be
 saved through Christ, by following the light of the Gospel 
dispensation, which they are under, what advantage hath the Christian? 
and what profit is there of baptism and Christianity?" If you make such 
an objection, you "show yourselves to be Christianized Jews" indeed. The
 apostle has just said, "If the uncircumcision," i.e. if uncircumcised 
heathens (like Melchisedec or Job, Cornelius or the Canaanitish woman) 
"keep the righteousness of the law [according to their light,] shall not
 their uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?" That is, shall they 
not be saved as well as if they were circumcised Jews? St. Paul saw that
 the partial hearts of the Jews would take fright at his doctrine; and 
would start an objection, capable of demolishing, if possible, the 
impartiality of God, and the freeness of the everlasting Gospel. He 
therefore produces this formidable objection thus:-If the Gentiles may 
be saved by following their light, "what advantage hath the Jew? or what
 profit is there of circumcision?" Rom. iii, 1. The answer which he 
gives stops the mouths of all Jews, whether they live in London, Rome, 
or Jerusalem. "The Jews," says he, (and much more the Christians,) "have
 much advantage every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed
 the oracles of God." The heathens have only the light of God's works, 
the light of God's providence, the light of reason, the light of 
conscience, and the light of that saving grace which "has appeared to 
all men, teaching them to live soberly," &amp;c, and reproving them when
 they do not. But the Jews, (to say nothing of the light of tradition, 
which is far brighter among them than among the heathens,) over and 
above this fivefold light, have the light of the Old Testament; and 
Christians the light of the New.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Come then, my prejudiced brethren, let St. Paul's 
answer satisfy you. Get from under your parched gourd of reprobation. 
"Let not your eye be evil because God is good;" nor fret, like Jonah, 
because the Father of mercies extends his compassion even to all the 
humbled heathens in the great city of Nineveh. "As the elect of God, put
 on bowels of mercy," and show yourselves the genuine children of Him 
who "is loving to every man, and whose mercy is over all his works." So 
shall your mistakes no longer straiten your minds, sour your tempers, 
and shut your hearts against your "non-elected" neighbours.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">And supposing you are of the happy few, in whose 
souls the impartial grace of God overrules the ordinary consequences of 
your partial doctrines;-supposing you be "loving to every man," and have
 more bowels of mercy than the God whom you extol;-supposing you are 
true to all men, and surpass in sincerity the God whom you recommend, 
who calls "all men every where to repent," and all the day long 
stretches out his hands in token of his compassionate love to people, on
 whom he absolutely fixed his immortal hatred before the foundation of 
the world;-supposing, I say, you have the happiness of being so much 
better than your principles, so much holier than the god of your 
OPINIONS, [Note-I say not "the God of your SALVATION;"] yet, by 
renouncing those opinions, you will no longer countenance Antinomianism,
 deceive the simple, contradict yourselves, shock moralists, and render 
Christianity contemptible in the eyes of all that confound it with your 
doctrines of forcible grace to hundreds, and of forcible wrath to 
thousands.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Should you countenance your Jewish notions by 
saying, "We are Christians: we have nothing to do with the heathens:" I 
answer: (1.) You have far too much to do with them, when, by the 
"doctrine of grace," which you so zealously inculcate, you indirectly 
send them, one and all, to the pit; unless they are brought under the 
Christian dispensation. (2.) You renounce the Church of England, if you 
disregard them: for on Good Friday (the day on which Christ "tasted 
death for every man,") she enjoins us to pray thus for them: "O merciful
 God, who hatest nothing that thou hast made, nor wouldest the death of a
 sinner, but RATHER that he should be converted and live, have mercy 
upon all Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics." (3.) You indirectly 
sacrifice the feelings of humanity, and the honour of God's perfections,
 to your unscriptural doctrine of grace, when you embrace the horrid 
idea of the insured damnation of the heathens, for the injudicious 
pleasure of saying, "Why me! Why me!<i>" </i>and of teaching the "poor reprobated creatures," while they sink into the bottomless pit, to say, "Why me! Why me!<i>" </i>A dreadful <i>why me </i>this, which is not less offensive to God's justice, impartiality, goodness, and truth, than your <i>why me </i>is
 odious to his wisdom, equity, veracity, and holiness. (4.) If Cain was 
culpable for intimating that he had nothing to do with his brother, when
 he had just knocked him on the head, are they praiseworthy, who enjoy 
with peculiar delight, and recommend with uncommon glee, "doctrines of 
grace," so called, which absolutely fix the unavoidable damnation of 
perhaps as many millions of their unborn fellow creatures, as Abel had 
hairs upon his head? And do they mend the matter, when, to vindicate 
their severe opinions, they calmly wipe their mouth, and say, "We have 
nothing to do with the heathens?<i>" </i>That is, in plain English, "our
 orthodoxy demands, that they should inevitably perish if they do not 
explicitly believe in Christ crucified, of whom they never heard: nor do
 we care what becomes of them. Let them sink, provided <i>our </i>doctrines of grace stand!"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">* Should the persons whom I now address say that I
 falsify my subscriptions to the eighteenth article of our Church, by 
asserting that even the heathens, who fear God and work righteousness by
 the general light of Christ's grace, are accepted through Christ's 
unknown merits; I refer them to the Vindication of Mr. Wesley's Minutes,
 pages 171, 172, where that objection is answered.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">O my dear brethren, my heart is enlarged toward 
you, though yours is straitened toward the heathens, and those who do 
not engross the light of" the Sun of righteousness." Suffer the word of 
expostulation one moment more. Do not you detest the character of a 
stiff Pharisee? I know you do, in the circumcised progeny. And why 
should you admire it in the baptized race? I am persuaded that you abhor
 the damnatory bull of those self-elected men of old, who, from the 
height of their conceited orthodoxy, looked down upon their neighbours 
and said, "This people who know not [what we call] the law are cursed." 
And will you exemplify their uncharitable positiveness by indirectly 
saying, "This people [these myriads of men] who know not [what we call] <i>the Gospel </i>are
 cursed?" Will ye become Christianized Pharisees, to contenance 
abandoned Antinomians. No: the spark of candour in your breast is 
stirred, and almost sets fire to your prejudices. You are staggered, you
 are ready to yield to the force of truth! Some of you would do it even 
now, if you were not afraid that <i>our </i>doctrine of free grace 
obscures the Christian dispensation, and encourages the pernicious 
delusion of antichristian moralists. To convince you that your fear is 
groundless, permit me to expostulate with them before you.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION XII. <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>An address to anti-christian moralists.</i> </font>
</p><p><font size="4">MORAL men, who ridicule the Christian faith; you 
suppose that your honesty counterbalances your sins, which, by a soft 
name, you call <i>foibles; </i>and for which you hope that God will 
never punish you with hell torments. I do not desire to make the worst 
of things. I wish you were as good as you fancy yourselves to be. I wish
 you may have been as exact in all the branches of your duty as you 
pretend. I would rejoice if the law of respectful obedience to your 
superiors, of courteous love to your equals, and of brotherly kindness 
to your inferiors, had always been fulfilled in your words and actions, 
in your looks and tempers. I am ready to congratulate you, if in all 
cases you have done to your fellow creatures exactly as you would be 
done to; and never plunged once into the gulf of intemperance. But 
permit me to ask, if you have <i>fellow creatures, </i>have you not a <i>Creator? </i>And
 if you have a Creator, do not reason and conscience command you to 
render him warm gratitude, cheerful praise, humble adoration, and 
constant obedience? But have you done this one year, one month, one day,<i> </i>one hour, in all your lives?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Although you are so ready to make us understand 
that you are not is other men, adulterers, unjust, uncharitable, 
hypocrites, &amp;c, are you entirely satisfied with your own goodness? 
Nay, if you ever "looked into the perfect law of liberty," and searched 
your breasts with "the candle of the Lord," can you say, before the 
omniscient Searcher of hearts and spirits, that there is one of the 
commandments which you never broke in its spiritual meaning?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If, upon second thoughts, you cannot acquit 
yourselves; and if God's dignity as a Creator, his veracity as a 
Lawgiver, his wisdom as a Governor, his justice as a Judge, his holiness
 as a God, forbid him to hold the guilty guiltless; or to forgive them 
in a manner inconsistent with any one of his infinite perfections; are 
you wise to despise an Advocate with him, a Divine Prophet, an atoning 
Mediator? Is it prudent a you to run from the city of refuge, to which 
you should flee with unabated swiftness? Do you act a reasonable part 
when you take shelter under the dispensation of the heathens, from the 
blessings that pursue, and from the light that surrounds you, in this 
Christian land? If I may allude to the mysterious divisions of Solomon's
 temple-will ye obstinately remain in "the court of the Gentiles," when 
you are graciously invited to enter into "the holy place," with true 
Christians? Think ye, that because righteous heathens are saved without 
the explicit know-edge of Christ, <i>ye </i>may be saved upon <i>their </i>plan? If ye do, may the following remarks help you to see the unreasonableness of this conclusion!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. Not to repeat the hints already given to 
baptized heathens, I ask, is not a grain of sincere love to truth the 
very beginning of a true conversion? Is that man a sincere lover of 
light who runs away from the light of the sun and moon, under pretence 
that he has the light of a star? Do those people sincerely love money, 
who, when they are prevented with gold and silver, throw it back to the 
face of their benefactor, they have some brass? And is that moralist a 
sincere lover of truth, who contemptuously rejects the silver truths of 
the Jewish dispensation, and the golden truths of the Christian Gospel, 
under pretence that he is an adept in "the religion of nature," and has 
what I beg leave to call, <i>the brass </i>of heathenism?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. You talk much of "the religion of nature;" but should you not distinguish between the religion <i>natural </i>to man in his unfallen state, and that which is <i>natural </i>to him in his fallen condition? Is not the regimen which is natural to the healthy, <i>unnatural </i>and frequently <i>death</i>
 to the sick? If upright, innocent man, needed not a spiritual 
physician, does it follow that depraved, guilty man can do without one? 
does not heathenism allow the fall and degeneracy of man? Have not one 
of the wisest Pagans seen, though darkly, their need both of a mediator,
 and of a propitiatory sacrifice? Do you think it prudent, so to depend 
upon your self righteousness, as to trample under foot the Jewish and 
Christian revelations, together with the discoveries of considerate 
heathens? Does your wisdom show itself to advantage, when thus makes you
 sink below heathenism itself?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. No adult heathen was ever saved without the 
repentance of the contrite publican. "I am a guilty, helpless sinner, 
totally undone, if the mercy of Him that made me do not extend itself to
 me. Great Author of my existence, pity, pardon, and save me for thy 
mercy's sake." Now, if you were brought to this genuine repentance, 
would you despise the light of revelation that recommends it, and leads 
on to farther attainments? Think ye, that those who sincerely rejoice in
 the dawn of day, will readily decry morning light? Is it not therefore 
much to be feared that Pharisaism and impenitency stand in your way to 
Christianity, more than a mistaken respect for reason and truth? Nay, 
does not reason bid you assent to well attested matters of fact? And are
 not the Jewish and Christian revelations so inseparably connected with 
notorious events, that it is less absurd to doubt the exploits of 
Alexander and Ceasar, than to disbelieve the miracles of Moses and Jesus
 Christ?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">4. The heathens, who were saved without the 
explicit knowledge of Christ, far from despising it as you do, 
implicitly desired it; and those that were blessed with a ray of it, 
rejoiced in it like Abraham. That precious knowledge is offered to you; 
and (shocking to say!) you reject it! you make sport with it! you pass 
jests upon it! you call it <i>imposture! enthusiasm! </i>O! how much 
more tolerable will it be for Pharisaic heathens; yea, for Chorazin and 
Bethsaida, in the day of judgment, than for you, if you die under so 
fatal an error! And how can ye flatter yourselves, that because 
righteous heathens, who have but one talent, shall be saved in the 
faithful improvement of it; you, who have five, shall be saved, though 
you bury four of them?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"O! but I, for one, improve the fifth: I am 
moral." God forbid I should discountenance morality! I value it next to 
piety: nay, true morality is the second branch of true piety. 
Nevertheless, this you must permit me to say: Your morality hath either 
pride, impenitency, and hypocrisy at the bottom; or humility, sincerity,
 and truth. If the former, your morality, like Jonah's gourd, has a worm
 at its root. When the sun of temptation shall shine warmly upon you, or
 when death shall lay his cold hand upon you, your morality will wither,
 and afford you neither safety nor comfort: but if it has sincerity and 
truth at the bottom; and if you are faithful, your little light will 
increase, the clouds raised by your prejudices will break, and you shall
 "see the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ," because, 
like Saul of Tarsus, you do not oppose the truth maliciously, but 
"ignorantly in unbelief." And O! may these pages convey to you the 
accents of that "truth which shall make you free!" and may the gracious 
voice, which formerly thundered in the ears of the great Jewish 
moralist, the fierce opposer of the Christian Gospel: "Saul! Saul! why 
persecutest thou me?" May that voice, I say, whisper to each of you, 
"Honestus! Honestus! why neglectest thou me? <i>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:</i> Jesus, who yet act in the Mediator's part between my righteous Father and thy self-righteous soul. <i>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks </i>of
 my truth, and the stings of thy conscience. I am a Sun of righteousness
 and truth: wrap thyself in unbelief no more: let the beams of my grace 
penetrate thy prejudiced soul, and kindle redeeming love in thy frozen 
breast. Nor force me, by an obstinate and final denial of me before men,
 to fulfil upon thee the most terrible of all my threatenings, by 
'denying me also [neinre?] my father and his angels;-for, 'if ye [to 
whom my Gospel is fully preached] believe not that I am He, ye shall die
 in your sins.'"  </font>

</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>An address to a penitent mourner.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">THOU deniest that loving Redeemer no longer, O 
thou poor, mournng penitent, who art ready to sink under the burden of 
thy sins, and longest to find rest for thy soul. The Lord, who 
pronounces thee <i>blessed, </i>says, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my <i>mourning </i>people. By whom shall I comfort thee?<i>" </i>O!
 that it were by me! O! that I were so happy as to administer one drop 
of Gospel cordial to thy fainting spirit! Though I am less than the 
least of my Lord's servants, he sends thee by me a Benjamin's portion: 
be not above accepting it. Thou hast humbly received the <i>wounding </i>truths of the Gospel; why shouldst thou obstinately reject the <i>healing ones? </i>Thou
 hast eaten the bitter herbs of repentance: yea, thou feedest upon them 
daily, and preferrest them to all the sweets of sin. What then, O! why 
should thy heart rise against the flesh and blood of the true paschal 
Lamb? Why shouldst thou starve, when "all things are now ready?" Why 
shouldst thou not believe the whole truth as well as <i>one part </i>of 
it? Will "the word of God's grace" be more true ten years hence than it 
is now? is not "Christ the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?" If thy
 dull "believing in God has already saved thee from thy vain 
conversation and thy outward sins; how much more will a cheerful 
"believing in the Lord Jesus," save thee into Christian righteousness, 
peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Do not "begin to make excuse," and say, "I must 
not believe the joyous truths of the Gospel till they are first 
powerfully applied to my soul." It is right, very right for thee, for 
all, never to rest short of such an application. But how art thou to 
wait for it? In the way of duty, or out of it? Surely in the way of 
duty. And is it not thy duty no longer to "make God a liar?" Is it not 
thy bounden duty, as it is thy glorious privilege, to "set thy seal," as
 thou canst, to the word of God's grace, as well as to the declaration 
of his justice? Does he not charge thee to "believe," though it should 
be "in hope against hope," the reviving "record which he has given of 
his Son?" Is not "this the record: -That God has given to us eternal 
life, and this life is in his Son: that to as many as receive him, that 
is, to as many as believe on his name, he gives power to become the sons
 of God: that God commendeth his love toward us, in that when we were 
yet sinners, Christ died for us [men and for our salvation:] that his 
blood [through faith on our part] cleanseth from all sin: that he was 
delivered for our offences, and rose again for our justification, and 
that he even now "maketh intercession for us;" bearing us up in the arms
 of his mercy, that we sink not into hell, and "drawing to Him, who 
justifieth the ungodly, all men," that renounce their ungodliness as 
thou hast done, and believe in Jesus as I want thee to do?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If it is "a saying worthy of all men to be received, <i>that Jesus Christ came into the world to save even the chief of sinners," </i>upon
 Gospel terms; he undoubtedly came to save me and thee. Do not thou then
 foolishly excommunicate thyself from redeeming love. Away with thy 
unchristian, discouraging notions about absolute reprobation, 
preterition, non-election, &amp;c, &amp;c. Doubt not but thou art <i>conditionally </i>elected, that is, "chosen in Christ" to eternal salvation; yea, peculiarly chosen of God <i>explicitly </i>to
 "believe in that Just One who gave himself a ransom for all," and "by 
this one oblation of himself once offered, made a full, perfect, and 
sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of <i>the whole </i>world."
 Believe then thy election, and that of God. As certainly as Christ hung
 upon the cross, flesh of thy flesh, and bone of thy bone, thou art 
"chosen to <i>eternal </i>salvation THROUGH sanctification of the 
Spirit, and belief of the truth." Wilt thou then be powerfully saved 
here, and eternally saved hereafter? Only "make thy calling and election
 sure, through sanctification of the Spirit;" and make "sanctification 
of the Spirit sure, through belief of the truth."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Believe, as well as thou canst, this comfortable, 
this sanctifying truth, "God so loved the world, that lie gave his only 
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but 
have everlasting life." Be not afraid to conclude, upon the Divine 
record, that God loves thee, that <i>Christ gave himself for thee, </i>and
 that the Holy Ghost will gloriously witness the Saviour's love to thy 
soul. And calmly, yet earnestly wait for a Divine token, and an abiding 
sense of this love upon thy heart.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But, I repeat it, wait in faith: wait, believing 
the truth: wait, doing thy work; and Christ will surely finish his own: 
he will "save thee to the uttermost," from sin and hell into holiness 
and heaven. Remember, that as he once bled for thee, so he now "worketh 
in thee both to will and to do." Up then and be doing. "Work out thy own
 salvation with fear and trembling." Thou canst never do God's part, and
 he will never do thine: do not expect it; nor let the song of "finished
 salvation" make thee conclude that thou hast nothing to do. Even John 
Bunyan, in his "Heavenly Footman," cries out to the slothful, "If thou 
wilt have heaven, thou must run for it." And if thou dost not believe 
him, believe the Christians of the Lock Chapel, and of the Tabernacle, 
who, when they do justice to the second Gospel axiom, agree to "complain
 of spiritual sloth," in the following well known hymn: - </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Our drowsy powers, why sleep ye so? </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Awake, each sluggish soul;  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Nothing has half <i>thy work to do,</i> </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Yet nothing's half so dull, &amp;c.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The God of truth will warm thy heart in a rational manner, by <i>the truth, </i>which
 is the Divine cordial generally used by the Comforter for that purpose.
 Thou must therefore take that cordial first. If thou art "of little 
faith," there is no need that thou shouldst be of <i>little sense </i>also.
 Some absurdly refuse to believe the Gospel till they can feel it, (if I
 may so speak,) with their finger and thumb: so gross, so carnal are 
their ideas of truth! And others think it their duty just to look at, or
 to bear about the Gospel feast; supinely waiting till all its rich 
blessings are forcibly thrust into their hearts, or at least conveyed 
there, without any endeavour of their own. "When the truth shall be 
powerfully applied to my soul," says a modern Thomas, "I will believe, 
and not before." Avoid this common mistake. If thou wert invited to a 
feast, and one said, "You must not eat this rich food, unless it is 
first powerfully applied to your stomach;" wouldst thou not reply, that 
thou must first eat it, in order to such an application? Be as wise in 
spiritual things; and remember that the way of relishing the Gospel, and
 "feeling it to be the power of God unto salvation," is actually to 
believe it till we can, till "the Spirit of truth" makes us feel its 
efficacy.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"To eat or drink spiritually," and "to believe or 
receive the truth," are Gospel terms of the same import. Come, then, 
leave all thy excuses to those who have learned the lessons of 
"voluntary humility." If the king offered thee a present, would it not 
be impertinent to make him stretch out his hand for one hour, under 
pretence that thou art not yet worthy of his bounty? And thinkest thou 
that a similar conduct is not highly provoking to the King of kings? 
Does he not complain, "I called and ye refused: I stand at the door and 
knock: all the day long have I stretched my hands to a gainsaying and 
disobedient people?" Come, then, know thy distance: know thy place: know
 thy God: send thy absurd ceremoniousness back to Geneva: crucify thy 
guilty fears on Calvary; and make the best of thy way to Sion, "the 
mountain where God has made unto all people a feast of fat things, a 
feast of wines, of fat things full of marrow, of wines well refined."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"There is room," says the Lord: "Draw them with 
the bands of a man;" with arguments, threatenings, promises, 
expostulations, &amp;c.- "Compel them to come in." There is balm enough 
in Gilead, bread enough in my house, love enough in my heart, blood 
enough in the fountain that my Son has opened for sin, grace enough in 
the river that flows from my throne, truth enough in the Gospel of my 
grace to heal, nourish, delight, transport a world of prodigal sons and 
daughters. And is there not enough for thee, who "fearest God?" For 
thee, to whom "the word of this <i>Christian, </i>this great salvation 
is sent?" Did not Christ himself break the bread of consolation for 
thee, when he said, "Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you?<i>" </i>Did
 he not offer thee the cup of salvation, when he added, "This is the cup
 of the New Testament in my blood, shed for the remission of sins; drink
 ye <i>all </i>of it," and carry it into all nations- "preach it," offer
 it "to every creature?" I bring thee this bread; it "came down from 
heaven to give life to the world;" it was surely consecrated in 
Gethsemane, and broken on Calvary for thee, man, and for, thee, woman, 
and for thy salvation. O! if the fragments of perishing barley bread 
were so to be gathered, that none of them might be lost, with what 
thankfulness shouldst thou receive the morsel which I set before thee! 
With what "hunger after righteousness" shouldst thou feast upon it! How 
shouldst thou try to relish every crumb, every particle of Gospel truth;
 of "the meat that endureth to everlasting life;" of "the word of the 
Lord that abideth for ever!"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Wonder at our Lord's condescension. Lest thou 
shouldest think that the word of his servants is insignificant, although
 it is the word of truth, he prays particularly "for them that shall 
believe on him through their words;" and he asks, "How is it that ye do 
not discern this time" of love? "Yea, and why even of yourselves judge 
ye not what is right," and makes for your peace? "O ye that have no 
money, come, buy, and eat, buy wine and milk: yea, eat and drink 
abundantly, O beloved, without money, and without price. Hearken 
diligently unto me: eat ye that which is good: let your soul delight 
itself in fatness," in the richest Gospel truths. "Whosoever will, let 
him come and take of the <i>bread and </i>water of life freely." Thus 
"the water and the blood, the Spirit and the word," sweetly agree to 
invite thee, to chide thy delays, to bid thee come and welcome to 
Christ, and to all the unsearchable riches of his grace.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If thou refusest this drop of Gospel cordial, this
 crumb of the bread of life; or if, after a faint attempt to take it, 
thou sinkest back into thy stupid unbelief, I beg leave to inquire into 
the reason. (1.) Is it "the hour and the power of darkness?<i>" </i>Is 
thy mind so confused, and thy heart so distracted, that in this moment 
thou canst neither consider, nor welcome the truth? In this case, wait 
groaning: if thou canst not wait "in hope, believing against hope," 
endeavour at least not to yield despair. This storm will soon blow over:
 "the time of refreshing will come;" and the Lord, who permits thee to 
have fellowship with him in Gethsemane, will soon enable thee to triumph
 with him upon the mount.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hast thou little or no appetite for the truth? In 
this case, I fear, thou still feedest upon husks and ashes, which spoil 
thy spiritual digestion; and I advise thee to exercise repentance; 
remembering "that to be carnally minded is death," and that the promise 
is not made to the slothful, but to them who, "through faith and patient
 continuance in well doing, seek for glory" -to them who, in taking up 
their cross and denying themselves, inherit the Gospel promises.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hast thou made an absurd covenant with unbelief, 
as Thomas? Art thou determined not to credit God's record, unless he 
come down to thy terms? Dost thou still confound faith with its first 
fruits, and God's works with thine own? If this be thy case, how justly 
may the Lord suffer thee to go on moping, not only for a week, as the 
obstinate apostle did, but for years! And after all, when thou hast long
 dishonoured God, and tormented thyself by thy willful unbelief, thou 
wilt be glad to do upon a death bed what I want thee to do now. Being 
then surrounded by threatening billows, driven from thy carnal moorings,
 and tossed into true wisdom, thou wilt, without ceremony, venture upon 
the merits and blood of thy Saviour, and strive to enter, by wrestling 
faith, and agonizing prayer, into "righteousness, peace, and joy in the 
Holy Ghost." Happy would it be for thee, in the meantime, if thou went 
not wiser in thy own conceit than seven men that can render a reason; if
 thou wert not obstinately bent upon nursing thy curse; if thou didst 
confer with flesh and blood no more; and if, regarding the Gospel 
passport more than  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Solifidian embargoes, and the word of God more 
than the dispiriting speeches of faint-hearted spies, thou becamest one 
of the "ARONS to whom it is our heavenly Father's good pleasure to give 
the kingdom;<i>" </i>one of "the VIOLENT who take it by force,"-thou 
wouldst soon find that these two dispositions are as compatible as the 
two Gospel axioms; and "receiving the end of thy faith," thou wouldst 
soon, perhaps to-day, experience the astonishing force of truth, and 
taste the ravishing powers of the world to come.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION XI. <i> </i></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>An Address to Christian believers.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Ye taste those powers, happy believers, who see 
that God is love, boundless, free, redeeming, pardoning, comforting, 
sanctifying love in Jesus Christ. The more you believe it, the more you 
feel it. Do then always "the work of faith," and you shall always 
"abound in the patience of hope, and in the labour of love." You have 
believed the truth, and it has made you free. "Rejoice then in the 
truth:" worship the God of truth: triumph in Christ, "the <i>living </i>truth;"
 and be daily baptized "with the Spirit of truth." Beware of enthusiasm.
 "Speak the words of soberness and truth." God is not the author of 
nonsense.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Sail with all possible care through the straits of
 Pharisaism and Antinomianism. Many, by deviating from the word, have 
almost "made shipwreck of the faith." While some rest in high Pharisaic 
forms, others catch at empty Solifidian shadows, or slide into the 
peculiarities of a censorious mysticism, harden themselves against "the 
gentleness of Christ," and oppose a part of the truth as it is in Jesus.
 Embrace ye the whole: be valiant for the whole: recommend the whole: 
but above all, bring forth the fruits of the whole.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Be steady: many who believed once as firmly as you
 do, that Christ was a sacrifice for sin, consider him now only as a 
martyr for the truth. And some who were fully persuaded that God is 
"loving to every man" while the day of salvation lasts, now can <i>bear, </i>yea, perhaps <i>delight </i>to
 bear it insinuated that he is graceless and merciless to myriads of his
 unborn creatures. Be not thus carried about by a blast of vain 
doctrine, in opposition to the full tide of Scripture and reason. 
"Honour all men, and give double honour" to those to whom it is due; but
 be not moved from your steadfastness either by names or numbers. To 
judge of truth by popularity is absurd. Warm, zealous men, who can draw 
the attention, and work upon the passions of the populace, will always 
be popular; but popularity, you know, is no proof that any man's 
principles are unexceptionable. Go not then by that deceitful rule. 
"When truth is at stake, mind popular applause as little as a syren's 
song; and regard a Bonner's rack as little as a Nebuchadnezzar's 
dulcimer. Be cast into the furnace of persecution with two companions, 
rather than bow with thousands to the most shining, the most celebrated,
 and the richest image of error. If your two companions forsake you, O! 
do not forsake the truth. Turn not your back upon her when she wants you
 most. Run not away from her colours when the enemy pours in like a 
flood. If she be driven out of the professing Church, follow her to the 
wilderness,-and if need be, to the den of lions. There the God of Daniel
 will be with you; and from thence he will bring you out; for God will 
stand by the truth, and she will prevail at last. "Buy her" therefore at
 any rate; buy her, though you should give your last mite of wealth, and
 your last scrap of reputation for her: "and sell her not," though you 
should gain the whole world by the unhappy bargain.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"These things," O men of God, "have I written unto
 you concerning them that [by fair shows of spirituality and voluntary 
humility] seduce you" into Pharisaism or Antinomianism: "but the 
anointing, which you have received of God, abideth in you, [since you 
have not been seduced,] and it is truth, and is no lie, abide in it 
therefore. Err not from the truth. Walk in the truth. Do nothing against
 the truth, but for the truth: and, as you have purified your souls by 
obeying the truth, through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the 
brethren," see that his love extend itself particularly to your 
opponents. "Love them, love one another with a pure heart fervently." 
You will often be obliged to part with peace in order to maintain truth;
 but you never need to part with love. Be you herein followers of Christ
 and St Paul. You know that the Pharisees, the Herodians, the Sadducees,
 and the devil himself would gladly have made peace with those two 
champions of the truth upon the scandalous terms of betraying and giving
 her up. But St. Paul had not so learned Christ, and our Lord scorned to
 deny himself the truth, and to worship the father of lies. See how 
calmly, how lovingly, how resolutely they fight this good, this bloody 
fight of faith. Volleys of invectives and calumnies have been already 
thrown out against them: and now, reproving their persecutors, and yet 
praying for them, they go and meet bonds and prisons, stocks and 
scourges, the provoking taunt and the cruel mocking, the bloody sword 
and the ignominious cross. And how many stand by them in their 
extremity? Have ye forgotten the amazing number? "They ALL forsook him 
and lied. All men forsook me: I pray God, it may not be laid to their 
charge." And, astonishing! Judas, Peter, and Demas, led the van. O 
Jesus, stand by our weakness, and we will stand by thy truth! Thou 
sayest, "Will ye also go away?" And "to whom should we go," gracious 
Lord? "Hast thou not the words of truth, the words of everlasting life? 
Art thou not the light of the world and the light of men?<i>" </i>Our light and our life? Could all the <i>ignes fatui </i>in
 the professing world; could even all "the stars" in thy Church supply 
the want of thy light to our souls? No, Lord: be then our sun and shield
 for ever. Visit the earth again, thou uncreated Sun of righteousness 
and truth: hasten thy second advent: thy kingdom come! Shine without a 
cloud! Scatter the last remains of error's night! Kindle our minds into 
pure truth! Our hearts into perfect love! Our tongues into ardent 
praise! Our lives into flaming obedience! </font>

 be preposterous. If I have done it, it has been inadvertently; and I 
shall be thankful to any of my readers who will be at the trouble to set
 me right. But I once more beg forward disputants not to produce 
assertions and invectives, instead of arguments and well applied 
scriptures; and not to wire draw the controversy by still urging 
objections which I have already directly or indirectly answered, unless 
they show that such answers are insufficient; that my arguments are 
inconclusive; and the scriptures I quote misapplied. Two of those 
objections, however, deserve a more direct and full answer.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">I. Should it be said, "I puzzle people, by asserting that there can be any other saving faith but <i>the Christian faith; </i>and any other object of saving faith but <i>Christ crucified:</i>" I reply, that though <i>Christ crucified </i>is
 the capital object of my faith, I dare not admit the contracted notions
 that the Solifidians have of faith; because, if I did, I should 
subscribe to the necessary damnation of three parts of my fellow sinners
 out of four; and reject Christ's word, under pretence of exalting his 
person. Take a few more instances of it.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">Did not our Lord himself say to his disciples, "Have faith in God;" distinguishing <i>that faith </i>from faith in himself, as Mediator? John xvii,  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">Does not St. Paul declare that, as believing 
God was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, so it shall be imputed to 
us, "if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead?<i>" </i>Do
 I "forge" the following scriptures: "The righteousness of God is 
revealed from faith to faith-according to the proportion of 
faith-according as God hath dealt the measure of faith: if I have told 
you of EARTHLY things, and ye believe not; how shall ye believe if I 
tell you of HEAVENLY things?<i>" </i>And can we read Heb. xi, without 
seeing that the faith there described is more general than the faith 
which characterizes the Christian dispensation? By what art can we make 
it appear that Christ crucified was the object of the faith of those 
believers, of whom the apostle says, "By faith Noah, moved with fear, 
built an ark: by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau [the supposed 
reprobate] concerning things to come: by faith Jacob blessed the sons of
 Joseph: by faith Joseph gave commandment concerning his bones: by faith
 the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had 
received the spies?"<i> </i>If you insinuate, with respect to Rahab, 
that Joshua sent the spies, whom she entertained, and that they informed
 her that Joshua was a type of Christ crucified; will you not render 
your "orthodoxy" as ridiculous as if you rested it upon the frivolous 
difference there is between <i>if </i>and <i>if? </i>Mr. B. cannot show 
that the apostle ever distinguished between a Jewish IF, and a Christian
 IF; but I can quote chapter and verse, when I assert that he clearly 
distinguishes between Jewish and Christian <i>faith. </i>For, not to transcribe Heb. viii and x, does he not say, Gal. iii, 23, "Before faith [i.e. before <i>Christian </i>faith]
 came, we were kept under the law," i.e. under the Jewish dispensation, 
and the obscurer faith peculiar to it? Nor was this a damnable state; 
for St. Paul begins the next chapter by telling us that "the heir, as 
long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be 
LORD OF ALL; but is under tutors and governors till the time appointed 
of the father. Even so we, when we were children, [when we were under 
the Jewish dispensation,] were in bondage under the elements of this 
world: but when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, 
made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the 
law, that we [children differing nothing from servants] might receive 
the adoption of sons," i.e. the privileges of sons that are of age, and 
are no longer under tutors and governors. "For after that [Christian] 
faith is come, we are no longer under a school master, for we are all 
the [emancipated] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus," Gal. iii, 
25, 26. Is it not evident, from the comparing of these passages, that 
the faith of Jews constituted them children of God, but such children 
as, in general, "differed nothing from servants,"-such children as were 
in a state of nonage and bondage? Whereas Christian faith, (emphatically
 called <i>faith,) by </i>its superior privileges, introduces true Christians into "the glorious liberty of the <i>adult </i>sons
 of God." Before we can overthrow this doctrine, must we not, to use St.
 Peter's words, "wrest our beloved brother Paul's words, so as to 
overthrow the faith of some," yea, of all the Jews that lived "before 
faith came," i.e. before Christ brought believers from Mount Sinai to 
Mount Sion; from the earthly "Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her 
children, to the new Jerusalem, which is free, and is the mother of us 
all-that stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, 
and are not entangled again with the yoke of bondage?"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">The difference between the privileges of the 
Jewish, and those of the Christian faith and dispensation, is still more
 clearly described, 2 Cor. iii. There the Christian dispensation (called
 the ministration of the Spirit, because the promise of the Spirit is 
its great privilege, see John vii, 39,) is opposed to the Jewish 
dispensation, which the apostle calls "the ministration of 
condemnation," because it appointed no particular sacrifices for 
penitents guilty of adultery, idolatry, murder, blasphemy, &amp;c, and 
absolutely doomed them to die. This severe dispensation, says St. Paul, 
"was glorious, though it is done away: much more that which remaineth 
[the Christian dispensation] exceedeth in glory." Again: "Moses put a <i>typical </i>veil
 over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look 
to the end, &amp;c: but we [Christians] all, with open face beholding, 
as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image 
from glory to glory." 'What a privilege! And how many nominal Christians
 live below it; yea, below the privileges of the very heathens!  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">This, however, is <i>the one faith </i>of true Christians, who "have the same spirit of faith." It is <i>one </i>in
 its great object, "God manifest in the flesh"-one in its great promise,
 the promise of the Father, or "the kingdom in the Holy Ghost"-one in 
its new commandment, brotherly, universal love, that" perfects believers
 in one," and makes them partakers of so great salvation. This is the 
faith which St. Paul calls "the faith of God's elect," i.e. the faith of
 Christians, who are "chosen [above Jewish believers] to see the glory 
of the Lord with open face," when Jewish believers see it only" darkly 
through a veil." This very faith he calls, immediately after, the faith 
"common" to all Christians, "to Titus, my own son after the common 
faith," Tit. j, 1, 4. With an eye to this faith he likewise names 
Timothy, his" own son in the faith,-which is in Christ Jesus." A faith 
this, whereby Timothy, who was a Jewish believer from a child, was "made
 a partaker of Christ the great [i.e. the Christian] salvation:"-a faith
 which St. Peter calls "precious faith," and St. Jude, "most holy 
faith;" indirectly comparing it to "the most holy place" in the 
temple:-a faith which Christ calls "my faith," Rev. ii, 13, and "faith 
that is in me," Acts xxvi, 18. A faith this, far superior to the faith 
of the noble Jewish believers in Berea, who so candidly searched the 
Scriptures, when they had heard St. Paul preach,-and very far exceeding 
the candid disposition of those sincere heathens at Corinth, concerning 
whom our Lord said to St. Paul, "I have much people in this city." If 
the reader divests himself of prejudices, I hope that, instead of 
calling the doctrine of the Gospel dispensations, and the degrees of 
faith belonging to them, a "novel chimera," he will embrace and receive 
it as a truth which leads to a thousand others.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">II. Some of my opponents, who find it easier to
 pass a jest than to answer an argument, will probably think that to 
beat me and the doctrine of the dispensations out of the field of truth,
 they need only laugh at my "inventing" different sorts of faith "by the
 dozen."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">To nip this witticism in the bud, I declare, 
once more, that I make no more difference between the faith of a 
righteous heathen, and the faith of a father in Christ, than I do 
between daybreak and meridian light. That the light of a sincere Jew is 
as much one with the light of a sincere Christian, as the light of the 
sun in a cold, cloudy day in March, is one with the light of the sun in a
 fine day in May. And, that the difference between the saving faith 
peculiar to the sincere disciples of Noah, Moses, John the Baptist, and 
Jesus Christ, consists in a variety of <i>degrees, </i>and not in a diversity of <i>species; </i>saving
 faith under all dispensations agreeing in the following essentials: 
(1.) It is begotten by the revelation of some saving truth, presented by
 free grace, impressed by the Spirit, and received by the believer's 
prevented free agency. (2.) It has the same original cause in all, that 
is, the mercy of God in Jesus Christ. (3.) It actually saves all, though
 in various degrees. (4.) Its sets all upon working righteousness; "some
 bearing fruit thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred fold." And (5.) 
Through Christ it will bring all that do not make shipwreck of it, to 
one or another of "the many mansions," which our Lord is gone to prepare
 in heaven for his believing, obedient people.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">* I prefer this sense to that of the 
Calvinists, not only because unconditional election to eternal glory 
appears to me an unscriptural doctrine; but because the apostle, having 
named the sins in which all wicked heathens lived, says to the 
Corinthians, not "such were you ALL," but "such were SOME of you;" 
intimating that others were of those righteous people, concerning whom 
our Lord speaks when he says, "Inquire who is worthy." Let it be 
observed, however, that we do not rest our doctrine of free grace upon 
this or upon any one scripture brought in by the by, and rather by way 
of illustration than of proof. We have passages in abundance that are 
full to the point.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">III. Should it be objected, that "the doctrine 
of this Essay confounds faith and works;" to what I have said on this 
head in the preceding Cheeks I add: (1.) There is an essential 
difference between the holy faith of Adam in a state of innocence, and 
the justifying, sanctifying faith of a penitent sinner: for Adam only 
stood and worked by faith in God as Creator; but we rise, stand, and 
work, <i>chiefly </i>by faith in God as Redeemer and Sanctifier. (2.) 
Adam worked upon the terms of the first covenant, which requires 
innocence and perfect obedience; and we work upon the terms of the 
second, which, for Christ's sake, admits the sincere obedience of 
penitential faith. Here is then no mixing of the covenants, no 
confounding of faith and works; but only a vindication of the works of 
faith, and defending the faith that works by love. (3.) St. Augustine, 
the favourite father of the Solifidians, wrote a treatise <i>(De Fide cl Operibus) upon Faith and Works, </i>in
 the twenty-first chapter of which he has these words: "By believing in 
God with a right faith, by worshipping and knowing him, we are so far 
benefited, <i>(ut et benc vivendi ab ilb sit nobis auxilium, elsi peccaverirnus ab illo induigentiarn mereaniur) </i>as to be assisted by him to live well, and to obtain of him [for I must not literally translate the heretical word <i>met'eamur] </i>a pardon, if we have sinned." And, chap. 23, he adds: <i>Inseparabilis est bona vita fide qus per dilectionern operatur; irno vero en ipsa est bona vita: </i>a
 good life is inseparable from the faith that works by love; nay, that 
faith itself is a good life." Had I spoken so unguardedly, there would 
be just room for raising the objection which I prevent; but I have 
carefully distinguished between faith and works; representing faith as <i>the beating of the heart, </i>and works as <i>the pulse's </i>caused thereby; and holding forth faith as <i>the root, </i>and works as <i>the fruit </i>of evangelical obedience.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">IV. If some readers think that my views of 
truth are singular, I reply, that when I have reason and Scripture on my
 side, I am not afraid of singularity. However, as I should be glad to 
obviate even this objection, I shall present the reader with the 
sentiments of two of the most judicious divines of the last century, Mr.
 Flavel and Mr. Goodwin.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">Mr. Flavel says, in his <i>Discourse on Menial Errors: </i>"Truthis
 the proper object, the natural and pleasant food of the understanding. 
'Doth not the ear' (that is, the understanding by the ear) 'try words, 
as the mouth tasteth meat?' The minds of all that are not wholly 
immersed in sensuality, spend their strength in the laborious search and
 pursuit of truth. Answerable to the sharpness of the mind's appetite, 
is the fine edge of pleasure and delight which it feels in the discovery
 and acquisition of truth. If Archimedes, upon the discovery of a 
mathematical truth, was so ravished that he cried out, Eupnxn arpsea, <i>I have found it! I have found it! </i>What
 pleasure must the discovery of a Divine truth give to a sanctified 
soul! 'Thy words were found of me,' says Jeremiah, 'and I did eat them: 
and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.' Truth lies 
deep <i>[Veritas inputco] </i>as the rich veins of gold do; if we will 
get the treasure, we must not only beg but dig also. We are not to take 
up with what lies uppermost, and next at hand upon the surface. 'Be ye 
transformed <i>by </i>the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good </font>
	<center><dt><font size="4">* I produce this as an extract, and not as a continued quotation.  </font></dt></center>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">acceptable, and perfect will of God.' It is a 
very great judgment of God to be given over to an erroneous mind: for 
the understanding being the leading faculty, as that guides, the other 
powers of the soul follow, as horses in a team follow the fore horse. 
Now how sad and dangerous a thing is this, for Satan to ride the fore 
horse, and guide that which is to guide the life of man! That is a 
dreadful, spiritual, judicial stroke of God, which we read of, Rom. i, 
26: 'Because they received not the love of the truth, God gave them up 
to strong delusions,' 2 Thess. ii, 13. They are justly plagued with 
errors that slight truth. Beside, what shame and trouble it must be to 
the zealous promoters of errors, not only to cast away their own time 
and strength, but also to ensnare and allure the souls of others into 
the same or worse mischief! For though God may save and recover you, 
those that have been misled by you may perish."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">Mr. Goodwin thus confirms Mr. Flavel's noble testimony in the preface to his <i>Redemption Redeemed: </i>"Truth
 is for the understanding, and the understanding for truth: truth, 
especially in things of a supernatural concernment, the knowledge 
whereof faceth eternity, &amp;c, being nothing else (interpretatively) 
but God himself prepared, of and by himself, for a beatifical union with
 the understanding, and from hence with the heart and affections of men.
 Error, in things of high import, can be nothing else than Satan, 
contriving and distilling himself into a notion, or impression likely to
 be admitted by the understanding, under the appearance, and in the name
 of truth, into union with itself, and by means hereof into union with 
the hearts of men. All error (of that kind I now speak of) being seated 
in the understanding, secretly and by degrees infuseth a proportionable 
malignity into the will and affections, and occasioneth unholy 
dispositions. Error is the great troubler of the world. It is that 
fountain of death that sendeth out all those streams of sin which 
overflow the earth. Why do men so universally walk in ways of 
oppression, deceit, drunkenness, uncleanness, envy, pride, &amp;c, but 
because they judge such ways as these (all circumstances considered) 
more desirable to them than ways of a contrary import? And what is this 
but a most horrid error and mistake, the result of those lying 
apprehensions concerning God, wherewith men willingly stiffen their 
minds to be corrupted even to spiritual putrefaction? Neither could the 
devil have touched Adam or Eve but by the mediation of some erroneous 
notions or other concerning God." And in his Dedicatory Epistle to the 
University of Cambridge he hath this fine thought, which I address to my
 readers:-" If you condemn, who will justify? Only God's eldest 
daughter, truth, has one mightier than you on her side, who will justify
 her in due time, though you should condemn her; and will raise her up 
from the dead the third day, in case you shall slay her."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">V. "By granting that people, who are under 
dispensations inferior to Christianity in its state of perfection, may 
have a degree of saving faith, although they have not yet the luminous 
faith of Christian believers, you damp the exertion of seekers, and 
invite them to settle, as-most dissenters do, in a lukewarm, Laodicean 
state, short of assurance and 'the kingdom of God,' which consists not 
only in 'righteousness, but in peace and joy by the Holy Ghost.'"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">If this objection could not be answered, I 
would burn my 'Essay; for I had much rather it should feed my fire, than
 the Laodicean spirit, which is already so predominant in the Church. 
But that this new difficulty is by no means unanswerable, will appear, I
 hope, by the following observations:-  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">1. Judicious Mr. Baxter, by a variety of strong
 arguments, shows, that to represent assurance, or the kingdom of God in
 the Holy Ghost, as essential to all true faith, and promiscuously to 
shut up, in a state of damnation, all those to whom that "kingdom is <i>not </i>come with power," is both cruel and unscriptural. (See the arguments in his <i>Confessions of Faith, </i>from p. 189 to 214.)  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">2. Ought we to keep from those who sincerely 
seek the kingdom of God the comfort that the Gospel allows them? Are not
 "they that seek the Lord" commanded "to rejoice?<i>" </i>And how can 
they do it, if "the wrath of God abideth on them," as it certainly does 
on all absolute unbelievers? Did not our Lord and St. Peter speak in a 
more evangelical strain, when they said to sincere seekers, "Fear not, 
little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the 
kingdom" of grace, as well as that of glory? "The promise [of the 
kingdom in the Holy Ghost] is unto you and to your children, and to as 
many as the Lord our God shall call" to believe explicitly in Jesus 
Christ.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">3. When Joshua urged the Israelites to cross 
Jordan, would he have done right if he had made them believe that they 
were still in Egypt, and had not yet taken one true step toward Canaan? 
Did he not encourage them to go up and to possess the good land by the 
very consideration which my objector supposes would have made them sit 
down in the wilderness? <i>Nay, </i>did not those who had already taken 
possession of the kingdoms of Og and Sihon, on the other side Jordan, 
cross that river first, and nobly lead the van, when their brethren went
 on from conquering 'to conquer'? And why should not spiritual 
Israelites, who turn their back upon spiritual Egypt, and seek the 
kingdom of God, be led on "from faith to faith" in the same comfortable 
manner?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">4. It is trifling to say, "Dead dissenters, and
 the formal Scotch clergy, preach up a faith short of Christian 
assurance, and therefore such a faith is a dangerous chimera:" for if 
they preach it in an unguarded, or in a careless manner, to set aside 
and not to illustrate the doctrine of Christian faith, they do the 
devil's work, and not the work of evangelists: what wonder is it then 
that such preaching should lull their congregations asleep? Again: if we
 ought not to give up the doctrine of sincere obedience and good works, 
though our opponents cry out perpetually, "It is the doctrine of all the
 carnal clergy in the kingdom:" and if it be our duty to maintain the 
doctrine of the trinity, though Dr. Priestley and all the Unitarians 
say, with great truth, "It is the doctrine of the superstitious 
Papists;" how absurd is it to urge that our doctrine, concerning a faith
 inferior to the faith of assurance, is false, merely because the 
objector says that this part of our doctrine is held by all the <i>sleepy </i>dissenters?
 Might we not, at this rate, be also ashamed of the doctrine of the 
Divine unity, which the Socinians, the Jews, and even the Turks hold, as
 well as we?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">5. Are there not many pious and judicious 
ministers in the Churches of England and Scotland, as well as among the 
dissenters, who dare not countenance the present revival of the power of
 godliness, chiefly because they hear us sometimes unguardedly assert 
that none have any faith but such as have the faith of assurance; and 
that the wrath of God actually abides on all those who have not that 
faith? If we warily allowed the faith of the inferior dispensations, 
which such divines clearly see in the Scriptures, and feel in 
themselves; would not their prejudices be softened, and their minds 
prepared to receive what we advance in defence of the faith of 
assurance?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">6. If it be urged, that the Spirit of God 
witnesses to all sincere seekers of the kingdom in the Holy Ghost, that 
they are in a damnable state till they feel the pardoning "love of God 
shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto them:" I demand
 proof; I deny the fact, and assert that the Divine Spirit can no more 
bear witness to an accepted, mourning Cornelius, <i>that he is not accepted in any sense, </i>than
 it can give testimony to a palpable contradiction. The truth is, our 
unbelieving fears and awakened hearts are very prone to surmise the 
worst, and we are very apt to take their surmisings for Divine 
impressions, even when we "bring forth fruits worthy of repentance." I 
doubt not but St. Paul himself, in his agony of penitential grief, when 
he spent three days and three nights in fasting and prayer, had many 
such gloomy despairing thoughts; but they were certainly lying thoughts,
 as well as those which David wisely checks in some of his Psalms. Who 
will dare to say that Ananias found the apostle in a damnable state, 
though he found him without a sense of sin forgiven, as appears from the
 direction which he gave him, "Arise, why tarriest thou? Wash away thy 
sins, calling upon [and consequently <i>believing in] </i>the name of the Lord."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">7. My objector's argument is as much levelled at St. Paul's doctrine as at <i>my </i>Essay:
 "Men and brethren," &amp;c, said he to his audience at Antioch, 
"whosoever among you FEARETH God, to you is the word of THIS SALVATION 
sent," Acts xiii, 26. But none of the pious hearers, whom he thus 
addressed, were unwise enough to reply, "Thou acknowledgest that we 
'fear God:' and David says, 'Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.' 
Now, if we fear him, and are blessed, we are already in a state of 
salvation, and therefore need not 'this salvation' which thou preachest.
 If we see our way by the candle of Moses, as thou intimatest, what need
 is there that 'the Sun of righteousness' should arise upon us with 
'healing in his wings?'" I demand proof, therefore, that men who fear 
God in our day are more ready to draw pernicious inferences from the 
doctrine of the dispensations, than they were in St. Paul's time.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">8. The objections which I answer may, with 
equal propriety, be urged against St. Peter's doctrine. Acts ii, 5, and 
x, 7, we read of "DEVOUT men out of every nation under heaven," and of 
"a DEVOUT soldier that waited continually" on Cornelius, who himself 
"feared God, wrought righteousness, and was accepted-with all his 
house." By Acts xi, 9, 14, it evidently appears, that though Cornelius 
was cleansed by God himself, yet he must "send for Peter," who was to 
"tell him words whereby he and all his house SHOULD BE SAVED," that is, 
should become partakers of <i>the great salvation </i>revealed by the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. But although St. Peter began his discourse by 
acknowledging that his pious hearers "were accepted with God," none of 
the congregation said, "Well, if we <i>are accepted, </i>we are already 
in a state of salvation, and therefore we need not 'hear words whereby 
we shall be saved.'" On the contrary, they all "believed the word of 
this <i>fuller </i>salvation: for the Holy Ghost fell on all them that 
heard the word;" and St. Paul informs us that we "receive the Spirit by 
the hearing of faith:" compare Acts x, 44, with Gal. iii, 2, and John 
vii, 39. It is plain, from this account, that no preaching was ever 
attended with a more universal blessing, and that no discourse was ever 
so instrumental in conveying to all the power of the faith of assurance,
 than that very sermon which the apostle began by intimating that his 
hearers were already accepted, according to an inferior dispensation. 
Hence it is evident that the doctrine we maintain, if it be properly 
guarded, far from having a necessary tendency to lull people asleep, is 
admirably calculated to excite every penitent to faith, prayer, the 
improvement of their talents, and the perfecting of holiness.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">9. May we not sufficiently guard the Christian dispensation, by constantly affirming, (1.) That all <i>Christian </i>believers "have <i>now </i>the witness in themselves." (2.) That those who have it not either never had Christian faith, which is emphatically called <i>faith </i>in
 the Gospel, see Acts xiv, 27, or that they know only "the baptism of 
John:" or that, with the unsettled Galatians, they are actually "fallen 
from grace, that is, from the Christian dispensation; and now live 
"under the law," that is, in the darkness of the Jewish dispensation; 
supposing they are not quite departed from God by indulging known sin. 
(3.) That if they do not press after the faith of assurance, they are in
 the utmost danger of losing their talent of grace; like the young man 
whom Jesus loved, and who nevertheless went away sorrowful, when he was 
unwilling to give up all, and follow Jesus without reserve; or like 
those thousands of Israelites, "whom the Lord SAVED OUT OF the land of 
Egypt, and whom he afterward destroyed," when "they believed not" the 
word by which they were to be SAVED INTO the land of promise, Jude 5.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">10. Not to mention all the arguments by which 
the jealous Puritans defended the doctrine of assurance in the last 
century, and those by which the Methodists prove its necessity in our 
days, is not the first argument used in my address to the antichristian 
moralists, P. 564, sufficient, if it be properly managed, to enforce the
 absolute necessity of rising to higher dispensations, when God calls us
 to it? If Queen Yashti lost her crown for refusing to come to the royal
 banquet, at "the king's commandment:" if those who "begged to be 
excused," when they were invited to the Gospel feast, were at last 
dreadfully punished: if St. Paul says to loitering believers, who are 
backward to go on to perfection, "How shall we escape if we neglect so 
great salvation, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord;" nay, if
 Christ himself threatens to "spue lukewarm," slothful Laodiceans "out 
of his mouth;" do we want even terrifying arguments to lash the 
consciences of those carnal professors who, hoping they are perfectly 
safe in their low attainments, despise higher dispensations, and "bury 
their talent" of grace, till it be "taken from them, and given to" those
 who best improve their own? To conclude.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">11. You are afraid that the doctrine of this 
Essay will make "seekers rest in Laodicean lukewarmness;" but permit me 
to observe that the seekers you speak of are either froward hypocrites, 
or sincere penitents. If they are <i>froward hypocrites, </i>preaching 
to them the faith of assurance will never make them either humble or 
sincere. On the contrary, they will probably catch at an election, and 
then at an assurance of their own making; and so they will profess to 
have the faith for which you contend, when in fact they have only the 
name and notion of it. The religious world swarms with instances of this
 kind. If, on the other hand, the seekers for whom you seem concerned 
are sincere penitents; far from being hurt, they will be greatly 
benefited by our doctrine: for it will at once keep them from chilling, 
despairing fears, and from false, Crispian comforts; the two opposite 
extremes into which upright, unwary mourners are most apt to run. Thus 
our doctrine, instead of being dangerous to sincere seekers, will prove a
 Scriptural clue, in following which they will happily avoid the gloomy 
haunts of Pharisaic despair, and the enchanted ground of Antinomian 
presumption.  </font>
	<center><dt><font size="4">CONTAINING  </font></dt></center>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">1. <i>Ten more arguments to prove that all men 
universally, in the day of their visitation, have some gracious power to
 believe some saving truth. And, </i>2. <i>An answer to three more objections.</i>  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">BEING conscious that I cannot be too careful 
and guarded in writing upon so important and delicate a subject as that 
of the preceding Essay, I once more take up the pen to explain, 
strengthen, and guard the doctrine that it contains.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">I. I have said, (p. 523,) that "faith 
[considered in general] is believing heartily:" I add, "and sometimes it
 may signify a power to believe heartily." For, as God gives to all the 
heathens, in the day of their visitation, "a power to believe heartily 
that God is," &amp;c, indulging them with gracious calls and 
opportunities to use that power; we may say that he gives them <i>the faith </i>of their dispensation. Nevertheless all the heathens have not <i>that faith: </i>for many obstinately bury their talent, till at last it is taken from them.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">As this doctrine of faith entirely subverts the
 doctrine of finished damnation, which is so closely connected with the 
doctrines of absolute election and finished salvation; and as a 
Calvinist clergyman, who has seen part of this Essay, assures me that it
 shall he taken notice of; I beg leave to add the following arguments to
 those which I have produced, section first, to prove that faith is not 
the work of God in the sense of our adversaries, and that in the day of 
salvation, through "the free gift which is come upon all men," we have 
all <i>some </i>gracious power to believe <i>some </i>saving truth.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">1. If faith be the work of God in the same 
sense in which the creation is his performance, when Christ "marvelled 
at the centurion's faith," he marvelled that God should be able to do 
what he pleases, or that a man should do what he can no more help doing,
 than he can hinder the world from existing: that is, he marvelled at 
what was not at all marvellous: and he might as well have wondered that a
 ton should outweigh an ounce.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">2. When God invites "every creature" in "all 
the world" to believe, Mark xvi, 15, if he denies most of them power so 
to do, he insults over their wretched impotence, and acts a part which 
can hardly he reconciled with sincerity. What would the world think of 
the king, if he perpetually invited all the Irish poor over to England 
to partake of his royal charity, and took care that most of them should 
never meet with any vessels to bring them over, but such as would be 
sure to founder in the passage?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">3. When our Lord endeavoured to shame the 
Pharisees for their unbelief, he said, "John came to you, &amp;c, and ye
 believed him not, but the publicans and harlots believed him: and ye, 
when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe." But
 if faith is the work of God in the sense of our adversaries, was it any
 shame to the Pharisees that God would not do his own work? Had they any
 more reason to blush at it, than we have to redden, because God does 
not give us wings and fins, as he does to birds and fishes?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">4. To suppose that Christ assiduously preached 
the Gospel to the inhabitants of Capernaum, while all the time he 
withheld from them power to believe it, and that afterward he appointed 
them a more intolerable damnation for not believing: to suppose this, I 
say, is to cast the most horrible reflection upon the Lamb of God. But 
if it he allowed that those obstinate unbelievers will justly be sent 
into a more dreadful hell for having buried to the end their talent of 
power to believe in their stronger light; is it not reasonable to 
suppose, that those who shall go to a less intolerable hell, will also 
be sent there for having finally refused to use their talent of power to
 believe in their weaker light?  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">5. Although Christ positively says that men 
shall be damned for their unbelief, see John iii, 18; Mark xvi, 16, yet 
some of our adversaries deny it, being deservedly ashamed of 
representing our Lord as damning myriads of men for not doing what is 
absolutely impossible. Hence they tell us that reprobates shall be 
damned only for their sins. But this unscriptural contrivance does not 
mend the matter; for I have shown, section seventh, that bad works, or 
sins, necessarily flow from unbelief. Now unbelief being nothing but the
 absence of faith, God, by absolutely withholding all saving faith, 
necessarily causes all unbelief; and unbelief, by necessarily causing 
all sin, necessarily causes also all damnation. For he that absolutely 
withholds all light, necessarily causes all darkness, and of course all 
the works of darkness. Thus "the doctrines of grace" (so called) that 
seem to rear their graceful head to heaven, end in the graceless, 
venomous tail of finished damnation. <i>"Desinet in piscem mulierformosa superne."</i>  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">6. The design of the Gospel, with regard to 
God, is evidently to extol his grace, and clear his justice. Now if an 
absolute decree of preterition or limited redemption hinders a vast 
majority of mankind from believing to salvation, both these ends of the 
Gospel are entirely defeated in all that perish: for God, by passing by 
the reprobated culprits, thousands of years before they were born, and 
by withholding every dram of saving grace from them, shows himself an 
absolutely graceless Creator to them all. Nor does this opinion less 
horribly impeach God's justice than his grace; for it represents him as 
judicially sentencing men to eternal torments, merely for the sin of a 
man whom most of them never heard of; or, which is all one, for the 
necessary, unavoidable, preordained consequences of that sin.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">7. St. Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, 
takes particular care to clear God's justice with respect to the 
condemnation of the wicked, "that every mouth may be stopped"-and (ΕIς 
~o ΕIνAI) "that they may be without excuse." But the scheme which I 
oppose, instead of leaving men <i>AνA'n'oλoγη~ς without excuse, </i>opens
 their mouths, and fills them with the best apology in the world: 
"Absolute necessity, and complete impossibility, caused by another 
before we were born." An apology this, which no candid person can ever 
object to.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">8. Agreeable to St. Paul's doctrine, our Lord 
observes that the man, sentenced to be cast into outer darkness for "not
 having on a wedding garment, was speechless." But if the Crispian 
doctrines of grace be true, might not that man, with the greatest 
propriety, have said to the Master of the feast, while the executioners 
"bound him hand and foot," "To all eternity I shall impeach thy justice,
 O thou partial Judge: thou appointest me the hell of hypocrites, merely
 because "I have not on a wedding garment," which thou hast from all 
eternity purposely kept from me, under the strong lock and key of thy 
irreversible decrees! Is this the manner in which thou "judgest the 
world in righteousness?"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">9. The parable of the talents, and that of the 
pounds, decide the question. The wicked and slothful servants, whose 
destruction they inform us of, are not condemned because their master 
was "hard and austere;" but because the one had "buried his talent [of 
power] in the earth," and the other had hid his "pound [of grace] in a 
napkin" manufactured at Laodicea.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">10. If salvation depends upon faith, and if God
 never gives reprobates power to "believe in the light that enlightens 
every man," and a sufficiency of means so to do; it follows that he 
never gives them any personal ability to escape damnation; but only to 
secure and increase their damnation; and thus he deals far more hardly 
with them than he did with devils. For Satan and his angels were all 
personally put in a state of initial salvation, and endued with a 
personal ability to do that on which their eternal salvation depended. 
To suppose, therefore, that a majority of the children of Adam, who are 
born sinful without any personal fault of their own, and who can say to 
the incarnate Son of God, Thou art flesh of our flesh, blood of our 
blood, and bone of our bone is to suppose, I say, that a vast majority 
of these favoured creatures have far less favour shown them than 
Beelzebub Himself had, is so graceless, so unevangelical doctrine, that 
one might be tempted to think it is ironically called <i>the doctrine of grace; </i>and to suspect that its defenders are styled "evangelical ministers" by way of burlesque.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">From the preceding arguments I conclude, that 
when it is said in the Scriptures people could not believe, this is to 
be understood either of persons whose day of grace was over, and who of 
course were justly given up to a reprobate mind, as the men mentioned in
 Rom. i, 21, 28, or of persons who, by not using their one talent of 
power to believe the obvious truths belonging to a lower dispensation, 
absolutely incapacitated themselves to believe the deep truths belonging
 to Christianity.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">II. Although I flatter myself that the 
preceding arguments guard the doctrine of free grace against the attacks
 of those who indirectly contend for free wrath; I dare not yet conclude
 this appendix. Still fearful lest some difficulty unremoved should 
prejudice the candid reader against what appears to me to be the truth, I
 beg leave to intrude upon his patience, by answering three more 
plausible objections to the doctrine of this Essay.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">OBJECTION I. "If faith be the gift of the God 
of grace to us, as sight is the gift of the God of nature, according to 
your assertion, (p. 525;) does it not follow that as we may see when we 
will, so we may believe in Christ-believe the forgiveness of our sins; 
and by that means fill ourselves with "peace and joy in the Holy Ghost" 
when we have 'a mind? But is not this contrary to experience? Do not the
 best Christians remember a time when they could no more believe than 
they could make a world, though they prayed for faith with all the 
ardour they were capable of?"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">ANSWER 1. You still seem to take it for granted
 that there is no true faith, but an explicit faith in Christ; and no 
explicit faith in Christ, but the faith of full assurance. But I hope 
that I have already proved the contrary in my answer to the fifth 
objection, (p. 577.) There are two extremes in the doctrine of faith 
which should be carefully avoided by every Christian: the one is that of
 the author of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis, </i>who thinks that an adulterous 
murderer may have true, saving faith in the height of his complicated 
crimes: and the other is that of those who assert there is no saving 
faith but that which actually cleanses us from all inbred sin, and opens
 a present heaven in our breasts. The middle path of truth lies exactly 
between those opposite mistakes, and that path I endeavour to point out.
  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">As, on the one hand, it never came into my mind
 that an impenitent murderer can have even the saving faith of a 
heathen: so, on the other hand, it never entered my thoughts, that a 
penitent can believe with the faith of full assurance when he will: for 
this faith depends not only upon our general belief of the truth 
revealed to us, but also upon a peculiar* operation of God, or 
revelation of his powerful arm. It is always attended with a 
manifestation of "the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits 
that we are the children of God." And such a  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">* Mr. Wesley exactly describes this faith in his sermon on <i>Scriptural Christianity, </i>of
 which you have here an extract:-" By this 'faith of the operation of 
God,' which was the very 'substance (or subsistence) of things hoped 
for,' the demonstrative 'evidence of invisible things,' he, [the 
penitent 'pricked to the heart,' and expecting the promise of the 
Father,] instantly 'received the Spirit of adoption, whereby he [now] 
cried, Abba, Father!' Now first it was that he could 'call Jesus Lord by
 the Holy Ghost, the Spirit itself bearing witness with his spirit, that
 he was a child of God.' Now it was that he could truly say, 'I live 
not, but Christ liveth in me,' &amp;c. 'His soul magnified the Lord, and
 his spirit rejoiced in God his Saviour. He rejoiced in him with joy 
unspeakable, who had reconciled him to God, even the Father; in whom he 
had redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.' He rejoiced 
in that 'witness of God's Spirit with his spirit, that he was a child of
 God;' and more abundantly 'in hope, of the glory of God,' &amp;c. 'The 
love of God [was also] shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost which 
was given to him. Because he was a son, God had sent forth the Spirit of
 his Son, crying, Abba, Father!' And that filial love of God was 
continually increased by the 'witness he had in himself of God's 
pardoning love to him, &amp;c, so that God was the desire of his eyes, 
and the joy of his heart; his portion in time and eternity, &amp;c. He 
that thus loved God, could not but love his brother also, &amp;c. This 
lover of God embraced all mankind for his sake, &amp;c, not excepting 
the evil and unthankful, and least of all, his enemies, &amp;c. These 
had a peculiar place both in his heart and his prayers. He loved them 
'even as Christ loved us,' &amp;c. By the same almighty love was he 
saved, both from passion and pride, from lust and vanity, from ambition 
and covetousness, and from every temper which was not in Christ, &amp;c.
 He spake evil of no man; nor did an unkind word ever come out of his 
lips, &amp;c. He daily grew in grace, increasing in strength, in the 
knowledge and love of God, &amp;c. He visited and assisted them that 
were sick or in prison, &amp;c. He 'gave all his goods to feed the 
poor.' He rejoiced to labour or to suffer for them; and whereinsoever he
 might profit another, there especially to 'deny himself.' Such was 
Christianity in its rise, [i.e. Christianity contradistinguished from 
the dispensation called the baptism of John.] Such was a Christian in 
ancient days, [i.e. a Christian contradistinguished from a disciple of 
John or of Christ, before the dispensation of the holy Ghost took 
place.] Such was every one of those who, 'when they heard manifestation 
God in general grants to none but them that groan deeply under "the 
spirit of bondage unto fear," as Paul did while he remained blind at 
Damascus;-or them that are peculiarly faithful to the grace of their 
inferior dispensation, and pray as earnestly for "power from on high," 
as the apostles did after our Lord's ascension.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">Therefore, from my asserting (p. 528) that "So 
long, as the day of salvation continues, all sinners, who have not yet 
finally hardened themselves, may day and night [through the help and 
power of the general light of Christ's grace mentioned John i, 9, and 
Tit. ii, 11,] receive some truth belonging to the everlasting Gospel," 
which takes in the dispensation of the heathens; from my asserting this,
 I say, you have no reason to infer that I maintain any man may, day and
 night, believe the forgiveness of his sins, and the deep truths of the 
Gospel of Christ; especially since I mention immediately what truth it 
is which all may believe, if they improve their talent, namely, this: 
"There is a God, who will call us to an account for our sins, and who 
spares us to break them off by repentance."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">2. It would be absurd to suppose that you can 
believe with the luminous faith of assurance, when God is casting your 
soul into the dark prison of your own guilt to bring down your Pharisaic
 looks, and make you feel the chains of your sins. But even then may you
 not believe that God is just, holy, and patient. May you not 
acknowledge that you deserve your spiritual imprisonment far more than 
Joseph's brethren deserved to be "put all together into ward three days"
 by their loving, forgiving brother - May you not believe that, although
 "heaviness may endure for a night," yet "joy cometh in the morning?' 
And when you have humbly groaned with David, - 'I am so fast in prison 
that I cannot get forth;" may you not pray in faith, "Bring my soul out 
of prison, that I may praise thy name. Let the bones which thou hast 
broken rejoice. Give me the garment of praise for the spirit of 
heaviness. Convince" me as powerfully "of righteousness," as thou hast 
"of sin:" and let thy Spirit, which now acts upon me as a "Spirit of 
bondage unto fear," begin to act as a "Spirit of adoption" and 
liberty-of "righteousness, peace, and joy'!" May you not even add, "O 
God, I believe thy promise concerning the coming of the Comforter; 'help
 thou my unbelief,' and grant me such a faith as thou wilt vouchsafe to 
'seal with that Holy Spirit of promise.' Thou shakest before me the rod 
of infernal vengeance: I deserve it a thousand times; but, O Father of 
mercies, O my Father, if for the sake of thine only begotten Son thou 
wilt yet permit such a wretch as I am to [the threatenings] of the chief
 priests and elders, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and 
were all filled with the Holy Ghost.'"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">I here set my seal to this Scriptural description of <i>'Scriptural Christianity, </i>being
 fully persuaded of two things: (1.) That till a man be thus "born of 
the Spirit," he "cannot see the [Christian] kingdom of God:" he cannot 
be under that glorious dispensation of Divine grace which Christ and the
 apostles spake of when they preached, "Repent, and believe the Gospel, 
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." (2.) That whosoever has not in 
his breast the above described kingdom, i.e. righteousness, peace, and 
joy in the Holy Ghost; and does not bring forth its excellent fruits in 
his life, either never was a spiritual Christian, or is fallen hack from
 the "ministration of the Spirit" into the dispensation of the letter, 
or the base form of godliness, if not into open wickedness. See the next
 note.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">call thee Father, give me the Spirit of 
adoption; and witness to my spirit that I am a child of thine. But if 
thou wilt still hide thy face from me, never suffer me to entertain one 
dishonourable thought of thee; never let me think thee a Moloch. Though 
thy justice slay me, let me still trust in thee, and believe that for 
Christ's sake thy mercy will revive my soul?" Is it Scriptural to rank 
among absolute unbelievers a penitent who thus humbly and obediently 
waits for the faith of full assurance-the faith of Christianity in its 
state of perfection? If our Lord pronounces such mourners blessed, does 
it become us to pronounce them accursed? But I return to your objection.
  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">3. The latter part of it confirms, instead of 
overturning my doctrine; it being evident that if the persons you speak 
of prayed with ardour for the faith of assurance, they had already some 
degree of faith: for praying is "calling upon the Lord," and St. Paul 
speaks "the words of soberness," where he says, "How shall they call on 
him in whom they have not believed?"  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">4. I am so far from thinking our power to 
believe is absolute, that I have asserted, (p. 528,) it is impossible 
heartily to believe the truths which do not suit our present state. And 
(page 538, &amp;c,) I have observed, that we savingly believe the "truth
 suitable to our present circumstances, when it is kindly presented by 
free grace, and affectionately embraced by prevented free will;" adding,
 that when we believe Our "faith is more or less operative, not only 
according to the earnestness with which we welcome the truth to our 
inmost souls," but also "according to the power with which the Spirit of
 grace impresses it upon our hearts." Nay, I have ascribed so much to 
the power of the free grace by which saving faith is "instantly formed,"
 as to insinuate that sometimes (as at St. Paul's conversion) this power
 for a while bears all down before it. This at least was my meaning, 
when I said, section first, "We may in general suspend the act of faith.
 especially when the glaring light [i.e. the luminous power] that 
sometimes accompanies the revelation of truth is abated." Consider the 
force of the words, <i>in general </i>and <i>especially; </i>advert to 
the exception for which they make room; and you will see I allow that 
free grace, at times, acts with almost as much irresistibility, as some 
moderate Calvinists contend for.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">5. With respect to my comparison between our 
power to believe, and our power to see, far from showing that all men 
may at any time believe the Gospel of Christ, it intimates, nay, it 
proves the very reverse. Can you see when you will, and what you will? 
Can you see in a dark night without a light? Can you see in a bright 
day, when a thick veil covers your face? Can you see if you place an 
opaque body full in your light? Can you see what is out of the reach of 
your eyes? Can you see the rising sun when you look full west, or the 
stars when you pore upon a dung hill? Can you see when you obstinately 
shut your eyes? Or when you have let a wicked man put them out, lest you
 should not live in idleness? Apply to faith these queries about sight; 
recollect the preceding observations: and you will perceive, (1. That 
our power to believe is various ways circumscribed; it being impossible 
that he who has but one talent, perhaps unimproved, should carry on as 
extensive a trade as the man who diligently improves his five or ten 
talents. (2.) That nevertheless, supposing we have still a ray of the 
light of truth, and have not yet been given up to judicial blindness, or
 to final hardness, we may day and night [if we do not still bury our 
talent] believe, by the above-mentioned helps, some obvious truth 
belonging to the lowest dispensation of Divine grace, and begin to 
follow our Lord's direction, "While ye have the light, believe in the 
light, that ye may be the children of the light." And, (3.) That if we 
oppose this doctrine, we begin to follow our Calvinist brethren into 
Crispianity; and are just ready to bow at the shrine of the great Diana 
of the day, and to kiss her iron-clay feet, finished salvation and 
finished damnation.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">OBJECTION VII. "Your doctrine concerning the 
school of faith, and its several forms; concerning the temple of faith, 
and its capital partitions, is entirely founded upon the doctrine of the
 dispensations of Divine grace; a doctrine this which many people will 
rank with what they call, <i>The novel chimeras of your Checks."</i>  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">I hope that I have proved what I have advanced 
concerning the dispensations, by arguments founded upon Scripture, 
reason, and conscience. However, that the idea of novelty may not stand 
in the way of any of my readers, out of filly authors, whom I may quote 
in support of this important doctrine, I shall produce two, E Calvinist 
and an anti-Calvinist; not doubting but their consentaneous testimony 
will sufficiently break the force of your objection. The first is the 
Rev. Mr. Green, late curate of Thurnscoe, in Yorkshire, and once an 
assistant to Mr. Whitefield. In his book, called <i>Grace and Τru1~s Vindicated </i>(page
 116,) you will find the following just remarks:- "It appears to me, 
from Scripture as well as experience, that there are divers 
dispensations, but the same Spirit: the kingdom of heaven consists of 
various degrees, and different mansions. This is true, whether by the 
kingdom of heaven we understand the outward professors of religion and 
the privileges, the inward kingdom of grace, or the kingdom of glory: 
[in all which senses the words in Scripture are frequently used.] As 
face answers to face in a glass, so do these respectively answer each 
other. Thus the outward privileges of religion from Adam to Moses were 
least; from Moses to Christ greater; and from Christ to the restitution 
of all things greatest. Again: to be a spiritual or enlightened heathen,
 as Socrates, Plato, or Cornelius before he heard Peter, is one degree 
or dispensation of grace. To be a spiritual or enlightened Jew, and with
 Peter and the other disciples before the day of pentecost to believe 
and acknowledge that Jesus is the Messiah, though not spiritually come, 
is a greater. But to be a spiritual Christian, to have Christ, the 
exalted God-man, revealed in us from heaven, and to be sealed with the 
Holy Spirit of promise unto the day of the redemption of this vile body,
 is the last and most perfect dispensation of grace. He that is feeble 
here shall be as David, and he that is strong, Sic, shall be, &amp;c, as
 the angel of the Lord, &amp;c. For it may be observed, that every 
dispensation admits of a growth therein; and moreover, that each, of 
them is in some sort and degree experienced by a spiritual Christian," 
&amp;c.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">My second witness is the Rev. Mr. J. Wesley, who, even in his first sermon on <i>salvation by faith, </i>preached
 near forty years ago, clearly distinguishes Christian faith, properly 
so called, or faith in Christ glorified, not only from the faith of a 
heathen, but also from the faith of initial Christianity, that is, "the 
faith which the apostles had while our Lord was upon earth."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">"And first," says he, "it [the faith that saves
 us into the great salvation described in the second part of the sermon]
 is not barely the faith of a heathen. Now God requires of a heathen to 
believe 'that God is, that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek
 him, &amp;c, by glorifying him as God,' &amp;c, and by a careful 
practice of moral virtue, &amp;c. A Greek or Roman therefore, yea, a 
Scythian or Indian, was without excuse if he did not believe thus much: 
the being and attributes of God, a future state of reward and 
punishment, &amp;c. For this is barely the faith of a heathen." Soon 
after he adds:-" And herein does it [this faith in Christ glorified] 
differ from that faith which the apostles themselves had while our Lord 
was upon earth, that it acknowledges the necessity and merit of his 
death, and the power of his resurrection."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">The doctrine of Christian perfection is 
entirely founded on the privileges of the Christian dispensation in its 
fullness: privileges these which far exceed those of the Jewish economy 
and the baptism of John. Accordingly Mr. Wesley in his sermons on 
Christian perfection makes the following just and Scriptural distinction
 between those dispensations:-" It may be granted, (1.) That David, in 
the general course of his life, was one of the holiest men among the 
Jews. And, (2.) That the holiest men among the Jews did sometimes commit
 sin. But if you would hence infer that all Christians do, and must 
commit sin, as long as they live; this consequence we utterly defy, it 
will never follow from those premises. Those who argue thus seem never 
to have considered that declaration of our Lord, Matt. xi, 11, verily I 
say unto you, among them that are born of women, there bath not arisen a
 greater than John the Baptist. Notwithstanding, he that is least in the
 kingdom of heaven is greater than he.' I fear indeed there are some who
 have imagined the kingdom of heaven here to mean the kingdom of glory: 
as if the Son of God had just discovered to us that the least glorified 
saint in heaven is greater than any man upon earth. To mention this is 
sufficient to refute it. There can, therefore, no doubt be made, but the
 kingdom of heaven here (as in the following verse, where it is said to 
be taken by force) or the kingdom of God, as St. Luke expresses it, is 
that kingdom of God on earth, whereunto all true believers in Christ, 
all real Christians belong. In these words then our Lord declares two 
things: (1.) That before his coming in the flesh, among all the children
 of men, there had not been one greater than John the Baptist: whence it
 evidently follows that neither Abraham, David, nor any Jew, was greater
 than John. (2.) That he who is least in the kingdom of God (in that 
kingdom which he came to set up on earth, a»d which the violent now 
began to take by force) is greater than he. Not <i>a greater prophet </i>(as
 some have interpreted the word) for this is palpably false in fact: but
 greater in the grace of God, and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. Therefore we cannot measure the privileges of real Christians by
 those formerly given to the Jews. 'Their ministration,' or 
dispensation, we allow 'was glorious;' but ours' exceeds in glory.' So 
that whosoever would bring down the Christian dispensation to the Jewish
 standard, doth 'greatly err, neither knowing the Scriptures, nor the 
power of God.'" From these excellent quotations, therefore, it appears 
that you do me an honour altogether undeserved, if you suppose that I 
first set forth the doctrine of the dispensations.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">OBJECTION VIII. "I cannot help thinking, that 
the doctrine of a faith proper to all those dispensations is above the 
capacity of plain Christians, and should never be mentioned, lest it 
should puzzle, instead of edifying the Church."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">If your fears be well grounded, even the 
apostles' creed is above the capacity of plain Christians; for that 
creed, the simplest of all those which the primitive Church has handed 
down to us, evidently distinguishes three degrees of faith: (l.) Faith 
"in God the Father Almighty, who made heaven and earth," which is the 
faith of the heathens. (2.) Faith in the Messiah, or "in Jesus Christ, 
his only begotten Son, our Lord," which is the faith of pious Jews, of 
John's disciples, and of imperfect Christians, who, like the apostles 
before the day of pentecost, are yet strangers to the great outpouring 
of the Spirit: and (3.) Faith "in the Holy Ghost;" faith of the 
operation of God, by  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">* I beg the reader will not mistake me. When I 
say that pious Jews and our Lord's disciples, before the day of 
pentecost, were strangers to the great out. pouring of the Spirit, I do 
not mean that they were strangers to his directing, sanctifying, and 
enlivening influences, according to their dispensation. For David had 
prayed, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me:" John the Baptist had been 
visited by his exhilarating power, even in his mother's womb: our Lord 
had "breathed upon his disciples, saying, Receive ye the Holy Ghost," 
and had imparted him to them as a "Spirit of grace and supplication," to
 help them to wait in faith and unceasing prayer, "till they were endued
 with power from on high.' Beside, they had called him Lord in truth; 
and no man can do this, but by "the Spirit of faith," which "helps our 
unbelief" and infirmities under all the Divine dispensations. 
Nevertheless, they were not fully baptized. The Comforter that visited 
them did not properly dwell in them. Although they had already wrought 
miracles by his power, "the promise of the Father was not yet fulfilled 
to them." They had not yet been "made perfect in one," by the 
assimilating power of the heavenly fire. They would have been puzzled by
 such questions as these:- "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye 
believed?" Acts xix, 2. "Is he fallen upon you?" Acts x, 44. "Is the 
love of God shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost given unto you?"
 Romans v, 5. Is the "fountain springing up into everlasting life" 
opened in your breast? John vi, 14. "After that ye believed, were ye 
sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise?" Eph. i, 18. That Spirit which 
forms those "rivers of living water that flow out of the belly," the 
inmost soul of believers? That Spirit which "was not given {before] 
Christ was glorified?" John vii, 39. That Comforter which it is more 
expedient for us to receive, than even to have Christ's bodily presence 
and constant instructions? John xvi, 7. If these and the like questions 
would have perplexed the apostles, before Christ had opened his 
spiritual baptism, and set up his kingdom with power in their hearts, we
 ought not to be surprised that professors, who "know only the baptism 
of John," should ingenuously confess they "never heard there was a Holy 
Ghost to be received, since they believed," Acts xix, 2. Nor should we 
wonder if devout Jews and easy Laodiceans should even mock and say, "You
 would have us to be 'filled with new wine;' but we are 'rich, and 
increased with goods, and have need of nothing.' "The water of our old 
cisterns is preferable to the new wine of your enthusiastic doctrine, 
and our baptismal ponds to your baptismal flames."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">This, however, was not Mr. Whitefield's 
language when he admitted an adult person to baptism; (and he knowingly 
admitted none but believers.) He knew how to pray for the promise of the
 Father, and how to point the disciple of which Christians complete in 
Christ believe "according to the working of God's almighty power," and 
are "filled with righteousness, peace, and joy in [thus] believing."  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">And here honesty obliges me to lay before the 
public an objection which I have had for some time against the 
appendages of the Athanasian creed. I admire the Scriptural manner in 
which it sets forth the Divine unity in trinity, and the Divine trinity 
in unity: but I can no longer indiscriminately use its damnatory 
clauses. It abruptly takes us to the very top of the Christian 
dispensation, considered in a doctrinal light. This dispensation it 
calls <i>the catholic faith: </i>and, without mentioning the faith of 
the inferior dispensations, as our other creeds do, it makes us declare 
that, "except every one keep that faith [the faith of the highest 
dispensation] whole and undefiled-he cannot be saved; without doubt he 
shall perish everlastingly." This dreadful denunciation is true with 
regard to proud, ungodly infidels, who, in the midst of all the means of
 Christian faith, obstinately, maliciously, and finally set their hearts
 against the doctrine of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; equally 
despising the Son's atonement and the Spirit's inspiration. But I will 
no more invade Christ's tribunal, and pronounce that the fearful 
punishment of damnation shall, "without doubt," be inflicted upon 
"every" Unitarian, Arian, Jew, Turk, and heathen, "that fears God and 
works righteousness," though he does not hold the faith of the 
Athanasian creed whole. For if you except the last article, thousands, 
yea millions, are never called to hold it at all; and therefore shall 
never perish for not holding it whole. See the notes, pages 451 and 551.
 At all hazards then, I hope, I shall never use again those damnatory 
clauses, without taking the liberty of guarding them agreeably to the 
doctrine of the dispensations. And if Zelotes presses me with my 
subscriptions, I reply beforehand, that the same Church which required 
me to subscribe to St. Athanasius' creed, enjoins me also to believe 
this clause of St. Peter's creed: "In every nation he that feareth God, 
and worketh righteousness, is accepted of him." And if those two creeds 
are irreconcilable, I think it more reasonable that Athanasius should 
bow to Peter, warmed by the Spirit of love; than that Peter should bow 
to Athanasius, heated by controversial opposition.  </font>
	</dt><dt><font size="4">To return: that the distinction of the three 
degrees of saving faith, omitted in the Athanasian creed, but expressed 
in the apostles' creed, John to the perfection of Christ's dispensation.
 As a proof of it, take part of the truly Christian hymn which he sung 
on that occasion:- </font>  
	</dt><dd>Anoint with holy fire, 
	</dd><dd>Baptize with purging flames 
	</dd><dd>This soul, and with thy grace inspire 
	</dd><dd>In ceaseless, living streams. 
	</dd><dd>Thy heavenly unction give, 
	</dd><dd>Thy promise, Lord, fulfil; 
	</dd><dd>Give power, [that is, faith] thy Spirit to receive, 
	</dd><dd>And strength to do thy will. 
</dd></dl>
<font size="4">This good old Gospel is far more clearly set forth in Mr.
 Wesley's sermon called "Scriptural Christianity," and in his "Hymns for
 Whitsunday," which I earnestly recommend, as pointing out the "one 
thing needful" for all carnal professors.  </font>
<p><font size="4">and in the Nicene creed; that this distinction, I say,
 is neither chimerical nor enthusiastical, may be proved by a variety of
 arguments, two or three of which, I hope, will not intrude too long 
upon the reader's patience.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. The first is taken from the doctrine expressly 
laid down in the New Testament. To what I have said on this head, p. 
573, &amp;c, I add here what Christ said to his disciples, "Ye believe 
in God, believe also in me." Here the most prejudiced may see that faith
 in the Father is clearly contradistinguished from faith in the Son. As 
for faith in the Holy Ghost, see in what manner our blessed Lord sowed 
the seed of it in the hearts of his disciples. "When the Comforter is 
come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of 
truth, he shall testify of me. It is expedient for you that I go away: 
for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I 
depart, I will send him unto you. Behold I send the promise of my Father
 unto you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued 
with power from on high." Nor was this great promise made to the 
apostles alone; for "in the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
 stood and cried, saying, If any man [not if an apostle] thirst, let him
 come to me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath 
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this he 
spake of the Spirit, which they that believed on him should receive: for
 the Holy Ghost was not yet given; [his dispensation. which is the 
highest of all, was not yet opened;] because that Jesus was not yet 
glorified." And the opening of this dispensation in our hearts requires,
 on our part, not only faith in Christ, but a peculiar faith in the 
promise of the Father; a promise this, which has the Holy Ghost for its 
great object.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">2. My second argument is taken from the 
experiences of those who, by the Holy Ghost, were made partakers of 
Christ glorified, either on the day of pentecost, or after it; and could
 feelingly confess Christ dying for us, and Christ living "in us, the 
hope of glory." Acts ii, 5, we read of "devout men out of every nation 
under heaven," who were come to worship at Jerusalem. But how could they
 have been devout men if they had not believed in God? What could have 
brought them from the ends of the earth to keep a feast to the Lord, if 
they had been mere Atheists? And yet it is evident, that through 
prejudice many of them rejected our Lord; putting him to open shame and a
 bloody death. But when Peter preached Christ on the day of pentecost, 
they at first believed on him with a true, though not with a luminous 
faith. This appears from the anguish which they felt upon being charged 
with having "slain the Prince of life." No man in his senses can be 
"pricked to the heart" merely for having had a hand in the just 
punishment of an impostor and a blasphemer, who "makes himself equal 
with God." If therefore keen remorse pierced the hearts of those 
penitent Jews, it is evident that they looked no more upon Christ as an 
impostor, but already believed in him as the true Messiah.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">No sooner had they thus passed from faith in the 
Father to an explicit faith in the Son, but they cried out, "What shall 
we do?" And Peter directed them to make, by baptism, an open, solemn 
profession of their faith in Christ, and to believe the great promise 
concerning the Holy Ghost. "The promise is unto you," said he. "Be 
baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the 
remission of sins; and ye [every one of you] shall receive the gift of 
the Holy Ghost." And upon their "gladly receiving the word," that is, 
upon their heartily believing the gladdening promise relating to pardon 
and to the Comforter; and no doubt upon their fervently praying that it 
might be fulfilled in them, "they were all filled with the Spirit," all 
their hearts overflowed with "righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy 
Ghost."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">St. Peter, speaking, Acts xi, of a similar 
outpouring of the Spirit, says: "The Holy Ghost fell on them [Gentiles] 
as on us [Jews] at the beginning. Then remembered I the word of the 
Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water, [them that 
entered his dispensation,] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy 
Ghost," when you shall enter the full dispensation of my Spirit: "God," 
adds Peter, "gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on 
the Lord Jesus Christ." And when "the apostles heard these things, they 
glorified God;" not indeed by shouting, "Then hath God given the 
Gentiles power to speak Arabic:" but by saying, "Then hath God also to 
the Gentiles granted repentance unto life," according to the fullness of
 the Christian dispensation.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">That this dispensation of the Holy Ghost, this 
coming of Christ's spiritual kingdom with power, is attended with an 
uncommon degree of sanctifying grace, is acknowledged by all; and that 
the gift of tongues, &amp;c, which at first, on some occasions and in 
some persons, accompanied the baptism of the Spirit, for a sign to 
bigoted Jews, or to stupid heathens;-that such a gift, I say, was a 
temporary appendage, and by no means an essential part of Christ's 
spiritual baptism, is evident from the merely spiritual effect which the
 receiving of the Holy Ghost had upon the penitent Jews, who, being 
"born of water and the Spirit,  pressed after the apostles into the 
kingdom on the day of Pentecost.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Even in the infancy of the Church," says an 
eminent divine, "God divided those [miraculous] gifts with a sparing 
hand. 'Were all [even then] prophets? Were all workers of miracles? Had 
all the gifts of healing? Did all speak with tongues?' No, in no wise. 
Perhaps not one in a thousand. Probably none but the teachers of the 
Church, and only some of them. It was therefore for a more excellent 
purpose than this that they, the brethren and apostles, 'were all filled
 with the Holy Ghost.' It was to give them [what none can deny to be 
essential to all Christians in all ages] 'the mind which was in Christ,'
 those holy 'fruits of the Spirit,' which whosoever hath not, is none of
 his; to fill them with 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, 
goodness.'"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">It is very remarkable, that although three 
thousand converts "received the gift of the Holy Ghost" on the memorable
 day in which Christ opened the dispensation of his Spirit, no mention 
is made of so much as one of them working a single miracle, or speaking 
with one new tongue. But the greatest and most beneficial of miracles 
was wrought upon them all: for "all that believed," says St. Luke, "were
 together; continuing daily with one accord in the temple, breaking 
bread from house to house, eating their meat with gladness and 
singleness of heart, praising God and having favour with all the 
people," by their humble, affectionate, angelical behaviour. Or, as the 
same historian expresses it, Acts iv, 32, "The multitude of them that 
believed"-spoke Greek and Latin! No: but "were of one heart and of one 
soul; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he 
possessed was his own; but they had all things common;" having been made
 perfect in one, agreeably to our Lord's deep prayer, recorded by St. 
John: "Neither pray I for these [my disciples] alone, but for them also 
who shall believe on me through their word, that they may be one; I in 
them, [by my Spirit,] and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in 
one."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">3. To this argument, taken from the experiences of
 the primitive Christians, I may add, that the doctrine of the 
dispensations is indirectly taught by our Church even to children, in 
her Catechism, where she instructs them to say, "By the articles of my 
belief I learn, <i>first, </i>to believe in God the Father, who made me, &amp;c. <i>Secondly, </i>in God the Son, who redeemed me, &amp;c. And, <i>thirdly, </i>in
 God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me." For these three distinctions 
are expressive of the three grand degrees of the faith, "whereby we 
inherit all the promises of God," and "are made partakers of the Divine 
nature." They are not descriptive of faith in three gods, but of the 
capital manifestations of the triune God, in whose name we are baptized;
 and of the three great dispensations of the everlasting Gospel, namely,
 that of the heathens, that of the Jews, and that of spiritual 
Christians; the dispensation of Abraham being only a link between 
heathenism and Judaism; and the dispensation of John the Baptist or of 
Christianity begun, being only a transition between Judaism and 
Christianity perfected.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Our Church Catechism brings to my remembrance the 
office of confirmation. It was, it seems, originally intended to lead 
young believers to the fullness of the Christian dispensation, agreeably
 to what we read, Acts viii, 12, &amp;c. Peter and John went from 
Jerusalem to Samaria to lay their hands on the believers who had not yet
 been baptized with the Holy Ghost, and to "pray that they might receive
 him: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they 'were 
baptized by Philip in the name of the Lord Jesus. When the Son of man 
cometh, shall he find faith upon the earth?" I fear but little of the 
faith peculiar to his full dispensation. Most professors seem satisfied 
with John's baptism or Philip's baμism. The Lord raise us apostolic 
pastors to pray in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. 
"Strengthen thy servants, O Lord, with the Holy Ghost, the Comforter; 
and daily increase in them thy manifold gifts of grace; the spirit of 
wisdom and understanding; the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength; 
the spirit of knowledge and true godliness; and fill them with the 
spirit of thy holy fear now and for ever." <i>(Order of Confirmation.) </i>Can
 it be said that those in whom that prayer is not now answered live 
under the dispensation of Christianity perfected? Are they either 
established Christians or spiritual Churchmen? How long shall the 
mystery of iniquity prevail? How long shall a Pharisaic, Deistical world
 destroy the faith of the Son, under colour of contending for faith in 
the Father? And how long shall a world of Antinomian, Solifidian 
professors destroy faith in the Holy Ghost, under pretence of 
recommending faith in the Son? O Lord, exert thy power. "Pour out thy 
Spirit upon all flesh," and give wisdom to all thy ministers to divide 
the word of truth aright, and to feed thy people according to their 
states and thy dispensations!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If these answers give my objector no satisfaction,
 and he still think it his duty to attack my Essay, I beg leave to 
address him in the words of a judicious divine of the last century:-" I 
shall not need, I presume, to desire you, that in your answer you will 
not rise up in your might against the weaker, looser, or less 
considerate passages or expressions, (of which kind you may very 
possibly meet more than enow,) but that you will rather bend the 
strength of your reply against the strength of what you shall oppose. 
You well know that a field may be won, though many soldiers of the 
conquering side should fall in the battle; and that a tree may flourish 
and retain both its beauty and firmness of standing in the earth, though
 many of the smaller twigs and lesser branches should prove dry, and so 
be easily broken off. So may a mountain remain unmoved, yea, unmovable, 
though many handfuls of the lighter and looser earth about the sides of 
it should be taken up, and scattered into the air like dust. In like 
manner the body of a discourse may stand entire in its solidity, weight,
 and strength, though many particular expressions, sayings, and 
reasonings therein, that are more remote from the center, should be 
detected either of inconsiderateness, weakness, or untruth."  </font>
