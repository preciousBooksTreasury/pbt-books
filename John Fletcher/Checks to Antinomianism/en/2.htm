<h1>SECOND CHECK TO ANTINOMINANISM</h1>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</p><p>THE publication of the "Vindication of Mr. 
Wesley's Minutes" having been represented by some persons as an act of 
injustice, the following letter is made public to throw some light upon 
that little event, and serve as a preface to the SECOND CHECK TO 
ANTINOMIANISM. <i> </i>
</p><p align="center"><i>To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley.</i>  
</p><p>"REV. AND DEAR SIR,--AS I love open dealing, I 
send you the substance, and almost the very words, of a private letter I
 have just written to Mr. Shirley, in answer to one, in which he informs
 me he is going to publish his Narrative. He is exceedingly welcome to 
make use of any part of my letters to Mr. Ireland, concerning the 
publication of my Vindication, and you are equally welcome to make what 
use you please of this. Among friends all things are, or should be, 
common.  
</p><p>"I am, Rev, and dear sir, yours, &amp;c,  
</p><p>J. FLETCHER.  
</p><p>"MADELEY, <i>Sept. </i>11, 1771." <i> </i>
</p><p align="center"><i>To the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Shirley.</i>  
</p><p>"REV. AND DEAR SIR,--It is extremely proper, nay, 
it is highly necessary, that the public' should be informed how much 
like a minister of the Prince of Peace, and a meek, humble, loving 
brother in the Gospel of Christ you behaved at the conference. Had I 
been there, I would gladly have taken upon me to proclaim these tidings 
of joy to the lovers of Zion's peace. Your conduct at that time of love 
is certainly the best excuse for the hasty step you had taken; as my 
desire of stopping my Vindication, upon hearing it, is the best apology I
 can make for my severity to you.  
</p><p>"I am not averse at all, sir, to your publishing 
the passages you mention, out of my letters to Mr. Ireland. They show my
 peculiar love and respect for you, which I shall at all times think an 
honour, and at this juncture shall feel a peculiar pleasure, to see 
proclaimed to the world. They apologize for my calling myself a <i>lover of quietness, </i>when I unfortunately prove a <i>son of contention: </i>and
 they demonstrate, that I am not altogether void of the fear that 
becomes an awkward, unexperienced surgeon, when he ventures to open a 
vein in the arm of a person for whom he has the highest regard. How 
natural is it for him to tremble, lest by missing the intended vein, and
 pricking an unseen artery, he should have done irreparable mischief, 
instead of a useful operation.  
</p><p>"But while you do me the kindness of publishing 
those passages, permit me, sir, to do Mr. Wesley the justice of 
informing him I had also written to Mr. Ireland, that 'whether my 
letters were suppressed or not, the Minutes <i>must </i>be vindicated,--that Mr. Wesley owed it to the Church, to the <i>real Protestants, </i>to
 all his societies, and to his own aspersed character;--and that, after 
all, the controversy did not seem to me to be so much, whether the 
Minutes should stand, as whether the Antinomian gospel of Dr. Crisp 
should prevail over the practical Gospel of Jesus Christ.'  
</p><p>"I must also, sir, beg leave to let my vindicated 
friend know, that in the very letter where I so earnestly entreated Mr. 
Ireland to stop the publication of my letters to you, and offered to 
take the whole expense of the impression upon myself, though I should be
 obliged to sell my last shirt to defray it, I added, that 'if they were
 published, I must look upon it as a <i>necessary evil </i>or <i>misfortune;' </i>which of the two words I used I do not justly recollect. <i>A</i> <i>misfortune </i>for
 you and me, who must appear inconsistent to the world: you, sir, with 
your Sermons, and I with my title page; and nevertheless <i>necessary </i>to vindicate misrepresented truth, defend an eminent minister of Christ, and stem the torrent of Antinomianism.  
</p><p>"It may not be improper also, to observe to you, 
sir, that when I presented Mr. Wesley with my Vindication, I begged he 
would correct it, and take away whatever might be unkind or too sharp; 
urging that, though I meant no unkindness, I was not a proper judge of 
what I had written under peculiarly delicate and trying circumstances, 
as well as in a great hurry; and did not therefore dare to trust either 
my pen, my head, or my heart. He was no sooner gone, than I sent a 
letter after him, to repeat and urge the same request; and he wrote me 
word he had 'expunged every tart expression.' <i>If he has, </i>(for I have not yet seen what alterations his friendly pen has made,) I am reconciled to their publication; and <i>that he has </i>I
 have reason to hope from the letters of two judicious London friends, 
who calmed my fears lest I should have treated you with unkindness.  
</p><p>"One of them says, 'I reverence Mr. Shirley for 
his candid acknowledgment of his hastiness in judging. I commend the 
Calvinists at the conference for their justice to Mr. Wesley, and their 
acquiescence in the declaration of the preachers in connection with him.
 But is that declaration, however dispersed, a remedy adequate to the 
evil done, not only to Mr. Wesley, but to the cause and work of God? 
Several Calvinists, in eagerness of malice, had dispersed their 
calumnies through the three kingdoms. A truly excellent person herself, 
in her mistaken zeal, had represented him as <i>a Papist unmasked, a heretic, an apostate. </i>A clergyman of the first reputation informs me <i>a Poem on his Apostasy </i>is
 just coming out. Letters have been sent to every serious Churchman and 
Dissenter through the land, together with the Gospel Magazine. Great are
 the shoutings, <i>And now that he lieth, let him rise up no more! </i>This
 is all the cry. His dearest friends and children are staggered, and 
scarce know what to think. You, in your corner, cannot conceive the 
mischief that has been done, and is still doing. But your letters, in 
the hand of Providence, may answer the good ends you proposed by writing
 them. You have not been too severe to dear Mr. Shirley, moderate 
Calvinists themselves being judges; but very kind and friendly to set a 
good mistaken man light, and probably to preserve him from the like 
rashness as long as he lives. Be riot troubled, therefore, but cast your
 care upon the Lord.'  
</p><p>"My other friend says, 'Considering what harm the 
Circular Letter has done, and what a useless satisfaction Mr. Shirley 
has given by his vague acknowledgment, it is no more than just and 
equitable that your letters should be published.'  
</p><p>Now, sir, as I never saw that <i>acknowledgment, </i>nor the <i>softening corrections </i>made
 by Mr. Wesley in my Vindication; as I was not informed of some of the 
above mentioned particulars when I was so eager to prevent the 
publication of my letters; and as I have reason to think, that through 
the desire of an immediate peace, the festering wound was rather skinned
 over than probed to the bottom; all I can say about this publication 
is, what I wrote to our common friend, namely, that 'I must look upon it
 as a necessary <i>evil.'</i>  
</p><p>"I am glad, sir, you do not direct your letter to Mr. Olivers, who was so busy in publishing <i>my </i>Vindication;
 for, by a letter I have just received from Bristol, I am informed he 
did not hear how desirous I was to call it in, till he had actually 
given out before a whole congregation it would be sold. Beside, he would
 have pleaded with smartness that he never approved of the patched-up 
peace, that he bore his testimony against it at the time it was made, 
and had a personal right to produce <i>my </i>arguments, since both parties refused to hear <i>his </i>at the Conference.  
</p><p>"If your letter is friendly, sir, and you print it
 in the same size with my Vindication, I shall gladly buy ten pounds' 
worth of the copies, and order them to be stitched with my Vindication, 
and given gratis to the purchasers of it; as well to do you justice as 
to convince the world that we make a loving war; and also to demonstrate
 how much I regard your respectable character, and honour your dear 
person. Mr. Wesley's heart is, I am persuaded, too full of brotherly 
love to deny me the Pleasure of thus showing you how sincerely I am, 
Rev, and dear sir, your obedient servant,  
</p><p>JOHN FLETCHER.  
</p><p>MADELEY, <i>September </i>11, 1771." <font size="6"><b> </b>

</p>
<h2>LETTER I.</h2>
<p>HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR,--I cordially thank you 
for the greatest part of your Narrative. It confirms me in my hopes that
 your projected opposition to Mr. Wesley's Minutes proceeded in general 
from zeal for the Redeemer's glory. And as such a zeal, though amazingly
 mistaken, had certainly something very commendable in it, I sincerely 
desire your Narrative may evidence your <i>good meaning, </i>as some think my Vindication does your <i>mistake.</i>  
</p><p>In my last private letter I observed, Rev, sir, that if your Narrative was <i>kind, </i>I
 would buy a number of copies, and give them gratis to the purchasers of
 my book, that they might see all you can possibly produce in your own 
defense, and do you all the justice your proper behaviour at the 
conference deserves. But as it appears to me there are some important 
mistakes in that performance, I neither dare recommend it <i>absolutely </i>to my friends, nor wish it in the religious world the <i>full </i>success you desire.  
</p><p>I do not complain of its severity; on the 
contrary, considering the sharpness of my fifth letter, I gratefully 
acknowledge it is <i>kinder </i>than I had reason to expect. But permit 
me to tell you, sir, I look for justice to the Scriptural arguments I 
advance in defence of truth, before I look for <i>kindness </i>to my 
insignificant person; and could much sooner be satisfied with the former
 than with the latter alone. As I do not admire the fashionable method 
of advancing general charges without supporting them by particular 
proofs, I shall take the liberty of pointing out some mistakes in your 
Narrative, and by that means endeavour to do justice to Mr. Wesley's 
declarations, your own sermons, my Vindication, and, above all, to the 
cause of practical religion.  
</p><p>Waiving the repetition of what I said in my last, 
touching the publication of my Five Letters to you, I object first to 
your putting a wrong colour upon Mr. Wesley's declaration. You 
insinuate, or assert, that he, and fifty-three of the preachers in 
conference with him, give up the doctrine of "justification by works in 
the day of judgment." "It appears," say you, "from their subscribing the
 declaration," notwithstanding Mr. Olivers' remonstrances, "that they do
 not maintain a second justification by works."  
</p><p>Surely, sir, you wrong them. They might have 
objected to some of Mr. Olivers' expressions, or been displeased with 
his readiness to enter the lists of dispute; but certainly so many 
judicious and good men could never so betray the cause of practical 
religion, as tamely to renounce a truth of that importance. If they had,
 one step more would have carried them full into Dr. Crisp's eternal 
justification, which is the very centre of Antinomianism; and without 
waiting for the return of the next conference, I would bear my <i>legal </i>testimony against their <i>Antinomian </i>error.
 Mr. Wesley I reverence as the greatest minister I know, but would not 
follow him one step farther than he follows Christ. Were he really 
guilty of rejecting the evangelical doctrine of a second justification 
by works, with the plainness and honesty of a Suisse I would address 
him, as I beg you will permit me to address you.  
</p><p>1. Neither you, Rev. sir, nor any divine in the 
world, have, I presume, a right to blot out of the sacred records those 
words of Jesus Christ, St. James, and St. Paul: "Blessed are they that 
do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life. Not 
every one that says to me, <i>Lord! Lord! </i>shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven, but he that does the will of my Father. Be ye 
therefore doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own 
selves. For we are under the law to Christ. Not the hearers of the law 
shall be just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. 
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, 
because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's
 work of what sort it is." His very words shall undergo the severest 
scrutiny. "I say unto you, [0 how many will insinuate the contrary!] 
that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account 
thereof in the day of judgment, for by thy words shalt thou [then] be 
justified, and by thy words shalt thou [then] be condemned."  
</p><p>Can you say, sir, that the justification mentioned
 by our Lord in this passage is the same as that which St. Paul speaks 
of as the present privilege of all believers, and has no particular 
reference to "the day of judgment" mentioned in the preceding sentence'?
 Or will you intimate our Lord does not declare we shall be justified in
 the last day by <i>works, </i>but by <i>words? </i>Would this evasion be judicious? Do not all professors know that <i>words </i>are <i>works </i>in
 a theological sense; as being both the signs of the "workings" of our 
hearts, and the positive "works" of our tongues? Will you expose your 
reputation as a divine, by trying to prove, that although we shall be 
justified by the <i>works </i>of our tongues, those of our hands and 
feet shall never appear for or against our justification? Or will you 
insinuate that our Lord "recanted" the legal sermons written Matt. v, 
and xii? If you do, his particular account of the day of judgment, chap.
 xxv, which strongly confirms and clearly explains the doctrine of our 
second justification by works, will prove you greatly mistaken, as will 
also his declaration to St. John, above forty years after, "Behold, I 
come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man as his work
 [not faith] shall be."  
</p><p>0, if faith alone turn the scale of justifying 
evidence at the bar of God, how many bold Antinomians will claim 
relation to Christ, and boast they are interested in his imputed 
righteousness! How many will say, with the foolish virgins, "'Lord! 
Lord! we are of faith, and Abraham's children. In thy name' we publicly 
opposed all legal professors, traduced their teachers as enemies to thy <i>free grace; </i>and,
 'to do thee service,' made it our business to expose the righteousness,
 and cry down the good works of thy people; therefore 'Lord! Lord! open 
to us!'" But, alas! far from thanking them for their pains, without 
looking at their boasted faith, he will dismiss them with a "Depart from
 me, ye that work iniquity!" As if he said--  
</p><p>"Depart, ye that made the doctrine of my atonement
 a cloak for your sins, or 'sewed' it as a 'pillow under the arms of my 
people,' to make them sleep in carnal security, when they should have 
'worked out their salvation with fear and trembling.' You profess to 
know me, but I disown you. My sheep I know: them that are mine I know. 
The seal of my holiness is upon them all: the motto of it, <i>(Let him that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity,) </i>is deeply engraven on their faithful breasts,--not on yours, ye 'carnal, ye sold under sin!'  
</p><p>"'And why called ye me, LORD! LORD! and did not 
the things which I said?' Why did you even use my righteousness as a 
breastplate, to stand it out against the word of my righteousness; and 
as an engine to break both tables of my law, and batter down my 
holiness? Your heart condemns you, ye 'sinners in Zion! Ye salt without 
savour!' Ye believers without charity! And am not I 'greater than your 
heart?' And 'know' I not 'your works?' Yes, 'I know that the love of God
 is not in you,' for you despised one of these my brethren. How could 
you think to deceive me, 'the Searcher of hearts and Tryer of reins?' 
And how did you dare to call yourselves by my name? As if you were my 
people? my dear people? mine elect? Are not all my peculiar people 
'partakers of my holiness,' and 'zealous of good works? Have not I 
chosen to myself the man that is godly,' and protested that 'the ungodly
 shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners,' though in sheep's clothing, 
'in the congregation of the righteous?' And say I not to the wicked, 
though he should have been one of my people, <i>Lo ammi, Thou art none of my people now. </i>'What
 hast thou to do with taking my covenant in thy mouth?' You denied me in
 works, and did not wash your hearts from iniquity in my blood; 
therefore, according to my word, 'I deny you,' in my turn, 'before my 
Father and his holy angels.' Perish your hope, ye hypocrites: and utter 
darkness be your portion, 'ye double minded! Let fearfulness surprise 
you,' ye tinkling cymbals! Let the fall of your Babels crush you, ye 
towering professors of my humble faith! Fly, 'ye clouds without water; 
ye chaff,' fly before the blast of my righteous indignation! 'Ye workers
 of iniquity! Ye Satans transformed into angels of light! Ye cursed, 
depart!'"  
</p><p>II. Nor is our Lord singular in his doctrine of 
justification, or condemnation, by works in the day of judgment. If it 
is a heresy, the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles are as great 
heretics as their Master. Enoch, quoted by St. Jude, prophesied, that 
when the Lord shall "come to execute judgment upon all men," he will 
"convince the ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds and hard 
speeches." This <i>conviction </i>will no doubt be in order to 
condemnation; and this condemnation will not turn upon unbelief, but its
 effects, "ungodly deeds and hard speeches." Solomon confirms the joint 
testimony of Enoch and St. Jude, where he says, "He that knoweth the 
heart, shall render to every man according to his works;" and again, 
"Know, O young man, that for all these things, for all thy ways, God 
shall bring thee into judgment."  
</p><p>St. Paul, the great champion for faith, is 
particularly express upon this anti-Crispian doctrine. "The Lord," says 
he, "in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of 
God, will render to every man according to his <i>deeds; </i>to them that <i>continue in well doing," </i>(here is the true perseverance of the saints!) "eternal life! Indignation Upon every soul of man that <i>does </i>evil, and glory to every man who <i>worketh </i>good;
 for there is no respect of persons with God. We shall all appear before
 the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things <i>done </i>in the body," not according to that he hath <i>believed, </i>whether it be true or false, but "according to that he hath <i>done, </i>whether it be good or bad." St. Peter asserts, that the Father, "without respect of persons, judgeth according to every man's <i>work." </i>And
 St. John, who, next to our Lord, gives us time most particular 
description of the day of judgment, concludes it by these awful words:  
</p><p>"And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books, according to their <i>works." </i>It is not once said, "according to their <i>faith."</i>  
</p><p>Permit me, sir, to sum up all these testimonies in
 the words of two kings and two apostles. "Let us hear the conclusion of
 the whole matter," says the king who chose wisdom, "Fear God, and keep 
his <i>commandments, </i>for this is the whole duty of man; for God shall bring every <i>work </i>into judgment, whether it be good or evil." "They that have <i>done </i>good,"
 says the King who is wisdom itself, (and the Athanasian creed after 
him,) "shall go into everlasting life; and they that have <i>not done </i>good," or "that have done evil, to everlasting punishment." "You see then," and they are the words of St. James, "that a man is <i>justified by works, </i>and
 not by faith only." By faith he is justified at his conversion, and 
when his backslidings are healed. But he is justified by works, (1.) In 
the hour of trial, as Abraham was when he had offered up Isaac: (2.) In a
 court of spiritual or civil judicature, as St. Paul at the bar of 
Festus: and, (3.) Before the judgment seat of Christ, as every one will 
be whose faith, when he goes hence, is found working by love; for there,
 says St. Paul, as well as in consistoral courts, "circumcision is 
nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the 
commandments of God," 1 Cor. vii, 19.  
</p><p>III. This doctrine is so obvious in the 
Scriptures, so generally received in all the Churches of Christ, and so 
deeply engraven on the consciences of sincere professors, that the most 
eminent ministers of all denominations perpetually allude to it; 
yourself, sir, not excepted, as I could prove from your sermons if you 
had not recanted them. How often, for instance, has that great man of 
God, the truly reverend Mr. Whitefield, said to his immense 
congregations, "You are warned; I am clear of your blood; I shall rise 
as a swift witness against you, or you against me, in the terrible day 
of the Lord! O, remember to clear me then!" or words to that purpose. 
And is not this just as if he had said, "We shall all be 'justified or 
condemned in the day of judgment' by what we are now <i>doing: </i>I by my preaching, and you by your hearing?"  
</p><p>And say not, sir, that "such expressions were only <i>flights of oratory, </i>and prove nothing." If you do, you "touch the apple of God's eye." Mr. Whitefield was not a <i>flighty orator, </i>but spoke the words of soberness and truth, with Divine pathos, and floods of tears declarative of his sincerity.  
</p><p>Instead of swelling this letter into a volume, (as
 I easily might,) by producing quotations from all the sober Puritan 
divines, who have directly or indirectly asserted a second justification
 by works, I shall present you only with two passages from Mr. Henry. On
 Matt. xii, 37, he says, "Consider how strict the judgment will be on 
account of our words. 'By thy words thou shalt be justified or 
condemned,'--a common rule in men's judgment, and here applied to God's.
 Note the constant tenor of our discourse, according as it is gracious 
or not gracious, will be an evidence for us, or against us, at that day.
 Those that 'seemed to be religious, but bridled not their tongue,' will
 then be found to have put a cheat upon themselves with a vain religion.
 It concerns us to think much of the day of judgment, that it may be a 
check upon our tongues." And again:  
</p><p>Upon those words, Rom. ii, 13, "Not the hearers of
 the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be 
justified;" the honest commentator says, "The Jewish [Antinomian] 
doctors bolstered up their followers with an opinion that all that were 
Jews, [the elect people of God,] how bad soever they lived, should have a
 glorious place in the world to come. This the apostle here opposes. It 
was a very great privilege that they had the law, but not a saving 
privilege, <i>unless they lived up to the law they had. </i>We may apply it to the Gospel: it is not hearing, but <i>doing that will save us," </i>John
 xiii, 17; James i, 22. Who does not perceive that Mr. Henry saw the 
truth, and spoke it so far as he thought his Calvinistic readers could 
bear it? Surely, if that good man dared to say <i>so much, </i>we, who have "done leaning too much toward Calvinism," should be inexcusable if we did not say <i>all.</i>  
</p><p>IV<i>. </i>These testimonies will, I hope, make 
you weigh with an additional degree of candour the following arguments, 
which I shall produce as a logician, lest any should be tempted to call 
me <i>a bold metaphysician, </i>or <i>almost a magician</i>  
</p><p>The voice that St. John heard in heaven did not 
say, "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, for their FAITH follows
 them:" no, it is <i>their works. </i>Faith is the hidden root, hope the
 rising stalk, and love, together with good works, the nourishing corn: 
and as the king's agents, who fill a royal granary, do not take in the 
roots and stalks, but the pure wheat alone; so Christ takes neither 
faith nor hope into heaven, the former being gloriously absorbed in 
sight, and the latter in enjoyment.  
</p><p>If I may compare faith and hope to "the chariot of
 Israel and the courser thereof," they both bring believers to the 
everlasting doors of glory, but do not enter in themselves. Not so <i>lore </i>and <i>good works; </i>for
 love is both the nature and element of saints in glory; and good works 
necessarily follow them, both in the books of remembrance which shall 
then be opened, and in the objects and witnesses of those works, who 
shall then be all present; as it appears from the words of our Lord, 
"You have done it," or "You have not done it, to one of the least of 
these my brethren;" and those of St. Paul to his dear converts, "You 
shall be 'my joy and my crown' in that day." Thus it is evident, that 
although <i>faith </i>is the temporary measure according to which God 
deals out his mercy and grace in this world, as we may gather from that 
sweet saying of our Lord, "Be it done to thee according to thy FAITH;" 
yet <i>love </i>and <i>good works </i>are the eternal measures, 
according to which he distributes justification and glory in the world 
to come. On these observations, I argue,  
</p><p>We shall be justified in the last day by the grace and evidences which shall then remain.  
</p><p>Love and good works, the fruits of faith, shall then remain.  
</p><p>Therefore we shall then be justified by love and good works, that is, not by faith, but by its fruits.  
</p><p>V. This doctrine, so agreeable to Scripture, the 
sentiments of moderate Calvinists, and the dictates of reason, 
"recommends" itself likewise "to every man's conscience in the sight of 
God." Who, but Dr. Crisp, could (after a calm "review of the whole 
affair,") affirm, that in the day of judgment, if I am accused of being 
actually a hypocrite, Christ's sincerity will justify me, whether it be 
found in me or not?  
</p><p>Again: suppose I am charged with being a drunkard,
 a thief, a whoremonger, a covetous person; or a fretful, impatient, 
ill-natured man; or, if you please, a proud bigot, an implacable zealot,
 a malicious persecutor, who, notwithstanding fair appearances of 
godliness, would raise disturbances even in heaven if I were admitted 
there: will Christ's sobriety, honesty, chastity, generosity: or will 
his gentleness, patience, and meekness, justify me from such dreadful 
charges? Must not I be found really sober, honest, chaste, and 
charitable? Must I not be inherently gentle, meek, and loving? Can we 
deny this without flying in the face of common sense, breaking the 
strongest bars of Scriptural truth, and opening the flood gates to 'the 
foulest waves of Antinomianism? If we grant it, do we not grant a second
 justification by works? And does not St. Paul grant, or rather insist 
upon as much, when he declares, that "without holiness no man shall see 
the Lord?"  
</p><p>VI. You will probably ask, what advantage the 
Church will reap from this doctrine of a second justification by works? I
 answer, that, under God, it will rouse Antinomians out of their carnal 
security, stir up believers to follow hard after holiness, and reconcile
 fatal differences among Christians, and seeming contradictions in the 
Scripture.  
</p><p>1. It will <i>re-awaken Antinomians,* </i>who 
fancy "there is no condemnation to them," whether they "walk after the 
Spirit" in love, or "after the flesh" in malice; whether they "forsake 
all" to follow Christ, or like Judas and Sapphira "keep back part" of 
what should be the Lord's without reserve. Thousands boldly profess 
justifying faith, and perhaps eternal justification, who reverence the 
commandments of God just as much as they regard the scriptures quoted in
 Mr. Wesley's Minutes.  
</p><p>* [I beg I may not be understood to level the following paragraphs, or any part of these letters, at my pious <i>Calvinist </i>brethren.
 God knows how deeply I reverence many, who are immovably fixed in what 
some call "the doctrines of grace;" how gladly (as conscious of their 
genuine conversion and eminent usefulness) I would lie in the dust at 
their feet to honour our Lord in his dear members; and how often I have 
thought it a peculiar infelicity in any degree to dissent from such 
excellent men, with whom I wanted both to live and die, and with whom I 
hope soon to reign for ever!  
</p><p>As these <i>real </i>children of God lament the 
bad use Antinomians make of their principles, I hope they will not be 
offended if I bear my testimony against a growing evil, which they have 
frequently opposed themselves. While the <i>Calvinists </i>guard the foundation against <i>Pharisees, </i>for which I return them my sincere thanks, they will, I hope, allow the Remonstrants to guard the superstructure against <i>Antinomians. </i>If
 in doing those good offices to the Church, we find ourselves obliged to
 bear a little hard upon the peculiar sentiments of our opposite 
friends, let us do it in such a manner as not to break the bonds of 
peace and brotherly kindness; so shall our honest reproofs become matter
 of useful exercise to that "love which thinketh no evil, hopeth all 
things, rejoiceth even in the <i>galling </i>truth," and is "neither quenched by many waters," nor damped by any opposition.  
</p><p>I have long wished to see, on both sides the 
question about which we unhappily divide, moderate men step out of the 
unthinking noisy crowd of their party, to look each other lovingly in 
the face, and to convince the world that with impartial zeal they will 
guard both the foundation and the superstructure against all 
adversaries, those of their own party not excepted. Whoever does this <i>omne tulit punctum, </i>he
 is a real friend to both parties, and to the whole Gospel; for he 
cordially embraces all the people of God, and joins in one blessed 
medium the Seemingly incompatible extremes of Scriptural truth. Ye men 
of clear heads, honest hearts, and humble loving spirits, nature and 
grace have formed you on purpose to do the Church this important 
service. Therefore, without regarding the bigots of your own party, in 
the name of the loving Jesus, and by his catholic Spirit give professors
 public lessons of <i>moderation </i>and <i>consistence, </i>and permit rue to learn those rare virtues with thousands at your feet.]  
</p><p>Upon their doctrinal systems they raise a tower of
 presumption, whence they bid defiance both to the law and Gospel of 
Jesus. His law says, "Love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as 
thyself, that thou mayest live" in glory. "If thou wilt enter into the 
life" (of glory,) "keep the commandments." But this raises their pity, 
instead of commanding their respect, and exciting their diligence. 
"Moses is buried," say they: "we have nothing to do with the law We are 
not under the law to Christ! Jesus is not a lawgiver to control, but a 
Redeemer to save us."  
</p><p>The Gospel cries to them, "Repent and believe!" 
and just as if God was to be the penitent, believing sinner, they 
carelessly reply, "The Lord must do all; repentance and faith are his 
works, and they will be done in the day of his power;" and so without 
resistance they decently follow the stream of worldly vanities and 
fleshly lusts. St. Paul cries, "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall 
die." "We know better," answer they; "there are neither <i>ifs </i>nor 
conditions in all the Gospel." He adds, "This one thing I do, leaving 
the things that are behind, I press toward the mark for the prize of my 
high calling in Christ Jesus--the crown of life. Be ye followers of me. 
Run also the race that is set before you." "What!" say they, "would you 
have us <i>run </i>and <i>work for life? </i>Will you always harp upon that legal string, <i>Do! do! </i>instead of telling us that we have nothing to do, but to believe that all is done?" St. James cries, <i>"Show your faith by your works; faith without works is dead </i>already, much more that which is accompanied by bad works."  
</p><p>"What!" say they, "do you think the lamp of faith 
can be put out as a candle can be extinguished, by not being suffered to
 shine? We orthodox hold just the contrary: we maintain both that faith 
can never die, and that living faith is consistent not only with time 
omission of good works, but with the commission of the most horrid 
crimes." St. Peter bids them "give all diligence to make their election 
sure, by adding to their faith virtue," &amp;c. "Legal stuff!" say they,
 "The covenant is well ordered in all things and sure: neither will our 
virtue save us, nor our sins damn us." St. John comes next, and 
declares, "He that sinneth is of the devil." "What!" say they, "do you 
think to make us converts to Arminianism, by thus insinuating that a man
 can be a child of God to-day, and a child of the devil to-morrow?" St. 
Jude advances last, and charges them to "keep themselves in the love of 
God;" and they supinely reply, "We can do nothing." Beside, "We are as 
easy and as safe without a frame as with one."  
</p><p>With the seven-fold shield of the Antinomian faith
 they would fight the twelve apostles round, and come off, in their own 
imagination, more than conquerors. Nay, were Christ himself to come to 
them <i>incognito, </i>as he did to the disciples that went to Emmaus, 
and say, "Be ye perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect:" it
 would be well if, while they measured him from head to foot with looks 
of pity or surprise, some were not bold enough to say with a sneer, "You
 are a perfectionist, it seems, a follower of poor John Wesley! are you?
 For our part, we are for Christ and free grace, but John Wesley and you
 are for perfection and free will."  
</p><p>Now, sir, if any doctrine, humanly speaking, can 
rescue these mistaken persons out of so dreadful a snare, it is that 
which I contend for. Antinomian dreams vanish before it, as the noxious 
damps of the night before the rising sun. St. Paul, if they would but 
hear him <i>out, </i>with this one saying, as with a thousand rams, 
would demolish all their Babels: "Circumcision is nothing, 
uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God:" 
or, to speak agreeable to our times, "Before the tribunal of Christ, 
forms of godliness, Calvinian and Arminian notions <i>are nothing: </i>confessions
 of faith and recantations of error, past manifestations and former 
experiences 'are nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God;' 
"the very thing which Antinomians ridicule or neglect!  
</p><p>2. This doctrine is not less proper to <i>animate feeble believers in their pursuit of holiness. O </i>if
 it were clearly preached and steadily believed,--if we were fully 
persuaded, we shall soon "appear before the judgment seat of Christ," to
 answer for every thought, word, and work, for every business we enter 
upon, every sum of money we lay out, every meal we eat, every pleasure 
we take, every affliction we endure, every hour we spend, every idle 
word we speak, yea, and every temper we secretly indulge,--if we knew we
 shall certainly "give account" of all the chapters we read, of all the 
prayers we offer, all the sermons we hear or preach, all the sacraments 
we receive; of all the motions of Divine grace, all the beams of 
heavenly light, all the breathings of the Spirit, all the invitations of
 Christ, all the drawings of the Father, reproofs of our friends, and 
checks of our own consciences,--and if we were deeply. conscious, that 
every neglect of duty will rob us of a degree of glory, and every 
willful sin of a jewel in our crown, if not of our crown itself; what 
humble, watchful, holy, heavenly persons should we be! How serious and 
self denying! How diligent and faithful! In a word, how angelical and 
divine, "in all manner of conversation!"  
</p><p>Did the <i>woman, </i>the professing Church, cordially embrace this doctrine, she would no more stay "in the wilderness, <i>idly </i>talking
 of her beloved;" but actually "leaning upon him," she would "come out 
of it," in the sight of all her enemies. No more wrapped up in the showy
 cloud of ideal perfection or imaginary righteousness, and casting away 
her cold garments, her moonlike changes of merely doctrinal apparel, she
 would shine with the dazzling glory of her Lord; she would burn with 
the hallowing fires of his love: once more she would be "clothed with 
the sun, and have the moon under her feet!"  
</p><p>Ye lukewarm talkers of Jesus' ardent love, if you 
were deeply conscious that nothing but love shall enter heaven, instead 
of judging of your growth in grace by the warmth with which you espouse 
the tenets of Calvin or Arminius, would you not instantly try your state
 by the thirteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, and 
by our Lord's alarming messages to the falling or fallen Churches of 
Asia? Springing out of your Laodicean indifference, would you not 
earnestly pray for the "faith of the Gospel, the faith that works by <i>burning </i>love?"
 if the fire be kindled, would you not be afraid of putting it out by 
"quenching the Spirit?" Would you not even dread "grieving" him, lest 
your love should grow cold? Far from accounting the "shedding abroad of 
the love of God in your hearts" an unnecessary frame, would you not be 
"straitened" till you were baptized, every one of you, with "the Holy 
Ghost and with fire?"  
</p><p>Ye who hold the doctrine of perfection without 
"going on to perfection," and ye who explode it as a pernicious 
delusion, and inconsistently publish hymns of solemn prayer for it, how 
would you agree, from the bottom of your reawakened hearts, to sing 
together, in days of peace and social worship, as you have carelessly 
sung asunder,  
</p><p align="center">O for a heart to praise our God!  
</p><p align="center">A heart from sin set free!  
</p><p align="center">A heart in every thought renew'd,  
</p><p align="center">And fill'd with love divine! <i> </i>
</p><p align="center"><i>Perfect, </i>and right, and pure, and good, 
</p><p align="center">A copy, Lord, of thine.--  
</p><p align="center">Bigotry from us remove,<i> </i>
</p><p align="center"><i>Perfect </i>all our souls in love, &amp;c. 
</p><p>O ye halcyon days! Ye days of brotherly love and 
genuine holiness! if you appeared to pacify and gladden our distracted 
Jerusalem, how soon would practical Christianity emerge from under the 
frothy billows of Antinomianism, and the proud waves of Pharisaism, 
which continually break against each other, and openly" foam out their 
own shame!" "What carefulness" would <i>godly sorrow </i>work in us all!
 "What clearing of ourselves," by casting away our dearest idols! "What 
indignation" against our former lukewarmness! "What of offending either 
God or man! "What vehement desire" after the full image of Christ! "What
 zeal" for his glory! And "what revenge" of our sins! "In all things we 
should approve ourselves," for the time to come, "to be clear" from the 
Antinomian delusion. Then would we see, what has seldom been seen in our
 age, distinct (not opposed) societies of meek professors of the <i>common faith </i>walking
 in humble love, and supporting each other with cheerful readiness, like
 different battalions of the same invincible army. And if ever we 
perceived any contention among them, it would be only about the lowest 
place and the most dangerous post. Instead of "striving for mastery," 
they would strive only who should stand truest to the standard of the 
cross, and best answer the neglected motto of the primitive Christians: <i>Non magna loquimur sed vivimus; </i>"Our religion does not consist in high Words, but in good works."  
</p><p>3. I observed that this doctrine will likewise <i>reconcile seeming contradictions in the Scriptures, and fatal differences among Christians. </i>Take
 one instance of the former: What can those who reject a second 
justification by works make of the solemn words of our Lord, already 
quoted, "By thy words thou shalt be justified, <i>or </i>by thy words 
thou shalt be condemned?" Matt. xii, 37. And by what art can they 
possibly reconcile them with St. Paul's assertions, Rom. iv, 5, "To him 
that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his 
faith is imputed to him for righteousness?" and v, 1, "Being justified 
by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Accept 
an example of the latter. In the Antinomian days of Dr. Crisp arose the 
honest people we call Quakers. Shocked at the general abuse of the 
doctrine of <i>justification by faith, </i>they rashly inferred it never could be from God; and seeing none "shall be justified <i>in </i>glory
 but the doers of the law," they hastily concluded there is but one 
justification, namely, the being made inherently just, or the being 
sanctified, and then declared holy. Admit our doctrine, and you have 
both parts of the truth,--that which the Antinomians hold against the 
Quakers, and that which the Quakers maintain against the Antinomians. 
Each alone is dangerous; both together mutually defend each other, and 
make up the Scriptural doctrine of justification, which is invincibly 
guarded on the one hand by FAITH against Pharisees, and on the other by 
WORKS against Antinomians. Reader, may both be thy portion! So shalt 
thou be eternally reinstated both in the <i>favour </i>and <i>image </i>of God.  
</p><p>VI. But while I enumerate the benefits which the Church will reap from a <i>practical </i>knowledge
 of our second justification by works, an honest Protestant, who has 
more zeal for, than acquaintance with the truth, advances, with his 
heart full of holy indignation, and his mouth of objections, which he 
says are unanswerable. Let us consider them one by one.  
</p><p>FIRST OBJECTION. "Your Popish, antichristian 
doctrine I abhor, and could even burn at a stake as a witness against 
it. Away with your new-fangled Arminian tenets! I am for old 
Christianity; and with St. Paul, 'determined to know nothing <i>for justification </i>but Christ, and him crucified.'"  
</p><p>ANSWER. Do you, indeed? Then I am sure you will 
not deny both Jesus Christ and St. Paul in this old Christian doctrine; 
for Christ says, "By thy words shalt thou be justified;" and St. Paul 
declares, "Not the hearers, but the doers of the law (of Christ) shall 
be justified." Alas, how often are those who say they" will know" and 
have "nothing but Christ," the first to "set him at nought" as a 
prophet, by railing at his holy doctrine: or to reject him as a king, by
 trampling upon his royal proclamations! But "I wot that through 
ignorance they do it, as do their rulers."  
</p><p>SECOND OBJECTION. "This legal doctrine robs God's 
dear children of their comforts and Gospel liberty, binds Moses' 
intolerable burden upon their free shoulders, and ' entangles them again
 in the <i>galling </i>yoke of bondage.'"  
</p><p>ANSWER. If God's dear children have got into a 
false liberty of doing the devil's works, either by "not going into the 
vineyard" when they have said, "Lord, I go," or by "beating their fellow
 servants" there, instead of working with them; the sooner they are 
robbed of it the better: for if they continue thus free, they will ere 
long be "bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness." It is the 
very spirit of Antinomianism to represent God's "commandments as 
grievous," and the keeping of his law "as bondage." Not so the dutiful 
children of God: "Their hearts" are never so much "at liberty," as when 
they "run the way of his commandments, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
 Keep them from obedience, and you keep them "in the snare of the devil,
 promising liberty <i>to others, </i>while they themselves are the servants of corruption."  
</p><p>Again: you confound the heavy yoke of the 
circumcision and ceremonial bondage, with which the Galatians once 
entangled themselves, with the "easy yoke of Jesus Christ." The former 
was intolerable, the latter is so "light a burden," that the only way to
 "find rest unto our souls is to take it upon us." St. Paul calls a dear
 brother his "yoke fellow." You know the word BELIAL in the original 
signifies "without yoke." They are <i>sons of Belial </i>who shake off the Lord's yoke; and though they should boast of their <i>election </i>as much as the Jews did, Christ himself will say concerning them, "Those mine enemies that <i>refused my yoke, </i>and
 would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them 
before me!" So inexpressibly dreadful is the end of lawless liberty!  
</p><p>THIRD OBJECTION. "Your doctrine is the damnable 
error of the Galatians, who madly left Mount Sion for Mount Sinai, made 
Christ the <i>alpha, </i>and not the <i>Omega, </i>and after 'having begun in the Spirit <i>would be </i>made perfect by the flesh.' This is <i>the other Gospel </i>which
 St. Paul thought so diametrically contrary to his own, that he wished 
the teachers of it, though they were 'angels of God,' might be even 
'accursed and cut off.'"  
</p><p>ANSWER. You are under a capital mistake: St. Paul 
could never be so wild as to curse himself, anathematize St. James, and 
wish the Messiah to be again cut off: for he himself taught the Romans, 
that "the doers of the law shall be justified." St. James evidently 
maintains a justification by works; and our Lord expressly says, "By thy
 words thou shalt be justified." Again: the apostle, if he had foreseen 
how his Epistle to the Galatians would be abused to Antinomian purposes,
 gives us in it the most powerful antidotes against that poison. 'fake 
two or three instances. (1.) He exhorts his fallen converts to the 
fulfilling of all the law: "Love one another," says he, "for all the law
 is fulfilled in this one word, <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;" </i>because
 none can "love his neighbour as himself," but he that "loves God with 
all his heart." How different is this doctrine from the bold Antinomian 
cry, 'We have nothing to do with the law!" (2.) He enumerates the works 
of the flesh, "adultery, hatred, variance, wrath, strife, envyings, 
heresies, &amp;c; of which," says he, "I tell you before, as I have told
 you in time past, that they who do such things" shall not be justified 
in the day of judgment, or, which is the same thing, "shall not inherit 
the kingdom of God." How different a Gospel is this from that which 
insinuates, "impenitent adulterers may be dear children of God, even 
while such, and in a very safe state, and quite sure of glory!" And (3.)
 As if this awful warning were not enough, he point blank cautions his 
readers against the Crispian error: "Be not deceived," says he, 
"whatever a MAN (not <i>whatever </i>CHRIST) soweth, that shall he also 
reap. He that soweth to the flesh shall reap corruption, and he that 
soweth to the Spirit shall reap life everlasting." How amazingIy strong 
therefore must your prejudice be, which makes you produce this epistle 
to thrust love and good works out of the important place allotted them 
in all the word of God! And no where more than in this very epistle!  
</p><p>FOURTH OBJECTION. "Notwithstanding all you say, I 
am persuaded you are in the dreadful heresy of the Galatians; for they 
were, like you, for 'justification by the works of the law;' and St. 
Paul resolutely maintained against them the fundamental doctrine of <i>justification by faith."</i>  
</p><p>ANSWER. If you once read over the Epistle to the 
Galatians without prejudice, and without comment, you will see, that 
(1.) They had returned "to the beggarly elements of this world," by 
superstitiously "observing days, months, times, and years." (2.) 
Imagining they "could not be saved except they were circumcised," they 
submitted expect that grievous and bloody injunction. (3.) Exact in 
their useless ceremonies, and fondly hoping to be justified by their 
partial observance of Moses' law, they well nigh forgot the merits of 
Christ, and openly trampled upon his law, and "walked after the flesh." 
Stirred up to contentious zeal by their new teachers, they despised the 
old apostle's ministry, hated his person, and" devoured one another." In
 short, they trusted partly in the merit of their superstitious 
performances, and partly in Christ's merits; and on this preposterous 
foundation they "built the hay" of Jewish ceremonies, and "the stubble" 
of fleshly lusts. With great propriety, therefore, the apostle called 
them back, with sharpness, to the only sure foundation, the merits of 
Jesus Christ; and wanted them to "build upon it gold and precious 
stones," all the works of piety and mercy that spring from "faith 
working by love."  
</p><p>Now which of these errors do we hold? Do we not preach present justification <i>by faith, </i>and justification at the bar of God <i>according to what a man soweth, </i>the
 very doctrine of this epistle? And do we not "secure the foundation," 
by insisting that both these justifications are equally through <i>the merits of Christ, </i>though the second, as our Church intimates in her twelfth article, is by the evidence of works?  
</p><p>Will you bear with me if I tell you my thoughts? 
We are all in general condemned by the Epistle to the Galatians, for we 
have too much dependence on our forms of piety, speculative knowledge, 
or past experience; and too little heart-felt confidence in the merits 
of Christ: "We sow <i>too little </i>to the Spirit, and <i>too much </i>to
 the flesh." But those, in the next place, are peculiarly reproved by 
it, who "return to the beggarly elements," the idle ways and vain 
fashions "of this world." Those who make as much ado about the beggarly 
element of water, about baptizing infants and dipping adults, as "the 
troublers" of the Church of Galatia did about circumcising their 
converts, "that they might glory in their flesh." Those who "zealously 
affect <i>others, </i>but not well:" those who now despise their spiritual fathers," whom they <i>once </i>received
 as angels of God:" those who "turn our enemies when we tell them the 
truth," who "heap to themselves" teachers, smoother than the 
evangelically legal apostle, and would call us blind if we said, as he 
does, "Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have 
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another," Gal. vi, 4. Those who 
plead for spiritual bondage while they talk of Gospel liberty, and 
affirm "that the son of the bondwoman" shall always live "with the son 
of the free;" that sin can never be cast out of the heart of believers, 
and that Christ and corruption shall always dwell together in this 
world. And, lastly, those who say there is no "falling away from grace,"
 when <i>they </i>are already fallen like the Galatians, and boast of their stability chiefly because they are ignorant of their fall!  
</p><p>FIFTH OBJECTION. "However, your Pharisaic doctrine
 flatly contradicts the Gospel summed up by our Lord, Mark xvi, 16, 'He 
that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be 
damned.' HERE is not one word about works. All turns upon faith."  
</p><p>ANSWER. Instead of throwing such hints, you might 
as well speak out at once, and say that Christ in these words flatly 
contradicts what he had said, Matt. xii, 37, "By thy words thou shalt be
 justified, or by thy words thou shalt be condemned." But drop your 
prejudices, and you will see that the contradiction is only in your own 
ideas. We steadily assert, as our Lord, that "he who believeth," or 
"endureth unto the end believing," (for the word implies both the 
reality and the continuance of the action,) "shall <i>infallibly </i>be 
saved;" because faith, which continues living, "works" to the last "by 
love" and good works, which will infallibly justify us in the day of 
judgment. For when faith is no more, love and good works will evidence, 
(1.) That we were grafted into Christ by true faith: (2.) That we did 
not "make shipwreck of the faith;" that we were not "taken away as 
branches in him which hear not fruit, <i>but </i>abode fruitful branches
 in the true Vine." And (3.) That we are still in him by HOLY LOVE, the 
precious and eternal fruit of true persevering faith. How bad is that 
cause which must support itself by charging an imaginary contradiction 
upon the Wisdom of God, Jesus Christ himself! *  
</p><p>* [This is frequently the stratagem of those who 
have no arguments to produce. I bore my testimony against it in the 
Vindication, and flattered myself that serious Writers would be less 
forward to oppose the truth, and expose the ministers of Christ by that 
injudicious way of discussing controverted points. Notwithstanding this,
 I have before me a little pamphlet, in which the editor endeavours to <i>answer </i>Mr. Wesley's <i>Minutes, </i>by extracting from his writings passages supposed to stand in direct opposition to time Minutes. Hence, in a burlesque upon the <i>Declaration, </i>he tries to represent Mr. Wesley as a knave.  
</p><p>I would just observe upon that performance, (1.) 
That by this method of raising dust, and avoiding to reason the case 
fairly, every malicious infidel may blind Injudicious readers, and make 
triumphing scoffers cry out, Jesus against Christ! Saul against St. Paul
 or John the divine against John the evangelist! as well as Wesley 
against John! and John against Wesley. (2.) Mr. Wesley having 
acknowledged, in the beginning of the Minutes, he "had leaned too much 
toward Calvinism," we may naturally expect to meet in his voluminous 
writings with a few expressions that look a little toward Antinomianism:
 and with some paragraphs Which (when detached from time context, and 
not considered as spoken to deep mourners in Zion, or to souls of 
undoubted sincerity,) seem directly to favour the delusion of time 
present times. (3.) This may be easily accounted for without flying to 
the charges of knavery or contradiction. When after working long with. 
out cheering light we discover the ravishing day of luminous faith, we 
are all apt, in the sincerity of our hearts, to speak almost as 
unguardedly of works as Luther did; but when the fire of Antinomian 
temptations has frequently burned us, and consumed thousands around us, 
we justly dread it at last; and ceasing to lean toward Crisp's divinity,
 we return to St. James, St. John, and St. Jude, and to the latter part 
of St. Paul's Epistles which we too often overlooked, and to which 
hardly two ministers did, upon the whole, ever do more justice than Mr. 
Baxter and Mr. Wesley. (4,) A man who gives to different people, or to 
time same people at different times, directly contrary directions, does 
not always contradict himself. I have a fever, and my physician, under 
God, restores me to health by cooling medicines; by and by I am 
afflicted with the cold rheumatism, and he prescribes fomentations and 
warming remedies, .hut my injudicious apothecary opposes him, under the 
pretence that lie goes by <i>no certain rule, </i>and <i>grossly contradicts himself. </i>Let
 us apply this to Mr. Wesley and the Versifier, remembering there is 
less difference between a burning fever and a cold rheumatism, than 
between the case of the trifling Antinomian and that of the dejected 
penitent. (5.) Whoever considers without prejudice what our satiric poet
 produces as <i>contradictions, </i>will find some of them do not so much as amount to an <i>opposition, </i>and that most of them do not <i>seem </i>so contradictory as numbers of propositions that might be extracted  
</p><p>from the oracles of God. If the editor of the <i>Answer to the Minutes </i>will
 compare this note with the 28th page of the Vindication, I hope he will
 find his performance answered, his direct attack upon the Minutes 
frustrated, and Mr. Wesley's honesty fully vindicated.]  
</p><p>SIXTH OBJECTION. "Your doctrine exalts man, and by
 giving him room to boast, robs Christ of the glory of his grace. 'The 
top stone' is no more 'brought forth with shouting, Grace! Grace!' but, 
Works! Works! 'unto it!' And the burden of the song in heaven will 
be,.--. Salvation to our works! and no more, Salvation to the Lamb!"  
</p><p>ANSWER. I no less approve your godly jealousy, 
than I wonder at your groundless fears. To calm them, permit me once 
more to observe, (1.) That this doctrine is Christ's, who would not he 
so unwise as to side with our self-righteous pride, and teach us to rob 
him of his own glory. It is absurd to suppose Christ would be thus 
against Christ, for even Satan is too wise "to be against Satan." (2.) 
Upon our plan, as well as upon Crisp's scheme, free grace has absolutely
 <i>all the glory. </i>The love and good works by which we shall be 
justified in the day of judgment, are the fruits of faith, and "faith is
 the gift of God." Christ is the great object of faith, the Holy Ghost, 
called the Spirit of faith, the power of believing, the means, 
opportunities, and will to use that power, are all the rich presents of 
God's free grace. All our sins, together with the imperfections of our 
works, are mercifully forgiven through the blood and righteousness of 
Christ: our persons and services are graciously accepted merely for his 
sake, and through his merits: and if rewards are granted us according to
 the fruits of righteousness we bear, it is not because <i>we </i>are 
profitable to God, but because the meritorious sap of the Root of David 
produces those fruits, and the meritorious beams of the Sun of 
righteousness ripen them. Thus you see, that, which way soever you look 
at our justification, God has all the glory of it, but that of turning 
moral agents into mere machines,--a glory which, we apprehend, God does 
no more claim than you do that of turning your coach horses into hobby 
horses, and your servants into puppets.  
</p><p>If <i>faith </i>on earth gives Christ the glory of all our salvation, you need not fear that <i>love </i>(a
 superior grace) will rob him in heaven: for "love is not puffed up, 
seeketh not her own, and does not behave herself unseemly" toward a 
beggar on earth; much less will she do so toward the Lord of glory, when
 she has attained the zenith of heavenly perfection. Away then with all 
the imaginary lions you place in your way to truth! Notwithstanding 
Crisp's prohibitions, like the Bereans, receive Christ in his holy 
doctrine, and be persuaded that in the last day you will shout as loud 
as the honest doctor, <i>Grace! Grace! and Salvation to the Lamb! </i>without suggesting, with him, to those on the left hand, the blasphemous shouts of <i>Partiality! Hypocrisy! Barbarity! and damnation to the Lamb! </i>Thus shall you have all <i>the free grace </i>he justly boasts of, without any of his horrid reprobating doctrine.  
</p><p>SEVENTH OBJECTION. "How will the converted thief, that did no good works, be justified by works?"  
</p><p>ANSWER. (1.) We mean by WORKS "the whole of our inward tempers and outward behaviour;" and how do you know <i>the outward behaviour </i>of
 the converted thief? Did not his reproofs, exhortations, prayers, 
patience, and resignation, evidence the liveliness of his faith, as 
there was time and opportunity? (2.) Can you suppose his <i>inward temper </i>was
 not love to God and man? Could he go into paradise without being born 
again? Or could he be born again and not love? Is it not said, "He that 
loveth is born of God;" consequently, he that is born of God loveth? 
Again: does not he who "loveth, fulfil all the law," and do, as says 
Augustine, all good works in one? And is not "the fulfilling of the law 
of Christ" work enough to justify the converted thief by that law?  
</p><p>EIGHTH OBJECTION. "You say, that your doctrine 
'will make us zealous of good works;' but I fully discharge it from that
 office: for 'the love of Christ constraineth us to abound in every good
 word and work.' " 
</p><p>ANSWER. (1.) St. Paul, who spoke those words with 
more feeling than you, thought the contrary; as well as his blessed 
Master, or they would never have taught this doctrine. You do not, I 
fear, evidence the temper of <i>a babe </i>when you are so exceedingly 
"wise above what" Christ preached, and "prudent above what" the apostle 
"wrote." (2.) If the love of Christ in professors is so <i>constraining </i>as
 you say, why do good works and good tempers bear so little proportion 
to the great talk we hear of its irresistible efficacy? And why do those
 who have tasted it "return to sin as dogs to their vomit?" Why can they
 even curse, swear, and get drunk? Be guilty of idolatry, murder, and 
incest? (3.) If love alone is always sufficient, why did our Lord work 
upon his disciples' hearts, by the hope of "thrones and a kingdom," arid
 by the fear of a "worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not 
quenched?" Why does the apostle stir up believers to "serve the Lord 
with godly fear," by the consideration that "he is a consuming fire?" 
Illustrating his assertion by this awful warning, "If they (Korah and 
his company) escaped not," but were consumed by fire from heaven, 
because they "refused him (Moses) that spake on earth; ranch more shall 
not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven!" Why 
did St. Paul himself, who, no doubt, understood the Gospel as well as 
Crisp and Saltmarsh, "run a race for an incorruptible crown, and keep 
his body under, LEST he himself should be a Castaway?" O ye <i>orthodox </i>divines,
 and thou ludicrous versifier of an awful declaration! instead of 
attempting to set St. Paul against St. Paul, and to oppose Wesley to 
Wesley, answer these Scriptural questions; and if you cannot do it 
without betraying <i>heterodoxy, </i>for the Lord's sake, for the sake 
of thousands in Israel, keep no more from the feeble of the flock those 
necessary helps which the "very chief of the apostles," evangelical 
Paul, without any of your Crispian refine.. meats, continually 
recommended to others, and daily used himself. And for your own souls' 
sake, never more prostitute these awful words, "The love of Christ 
constraineth us;" never more apply them to yourselves, while you refuse 
to treat the most venerable ambassador of Christ, I shall not say, <i>with respectful love, </i>but <i>with common decency.</i>  
</p><p>NINTH OBJECTION. "All the formal and Pharisaical 
ministers, who are sworn enemies to Christ and the Gospel of his grace, 
preach your legal doctrine of <i>justification by works in the day of judgment </i>."  
</p><p>ANSWER. And what do you infer from it? That the 
doctrine is false? If the inference be just, it will follow there is 
neither heaven nor hell; for they publicly maintain the existence of 
both. But suppose they now and then preach our doctrine without zeal, 
without living according to it, or without previously preaching the 
fall, and a present <i>justification by faith in Christ, </i>productive 
of peace and power, what can be expected from it? Would not the doctrine
 of the atonement itself be totally useless, if it were preached under 
such disadvantages? The truth is, such ministers are only for the roof, 
and you, it seems, only for the foundation. But a roof, unsupported by 
solid walls, crushes to death; and a foundation without a roof is not 
much better than the open air. Therefore, "wise master builders," like 
St. Paul, are for having both in their proper places. Like him, when the
 foundation is well laid, "leaving the first principles of the doctrine 
of Christ, they go on to perfection;" nor will they forget, as they work
 out their salvation, to shout, Grace! Grace! to the last slate that 
covers in the building; or to "the top stone," the key that binds the 
solid arch.  
</p><p>TENTH OBJECTION. "Should I receive and avow such a
 doctrine, the generality of professors would rise against me; and while
 the warmest would call me a <i>Papist, an antichrist, </i>and what not; my dearest Christian friends would pity me as an unawakened Pharisee, and fear me as a blind legalist."  
</p><p>ANSWER. "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad when all 
men (the godly not excepted) shall say all manner of evil of you falsely
 for Christ's sake,"--for preferring Christ's holy doctrine to the loose
 tenets of Dr. Crisp: and remember, that, in our Antinomian days, it is 
as great an honour to be called <i>legal </i>by fashionable professors, as to be branded with the name of <i>Methodist by </i>the sots who glory in their shame.  
</p><p>VII. As I would hope my objector is either 
satisfied or silenced, before I conclude, permit me a moment, Rev. sir, 
to consider the two important objections which you directly, or 
indirectly, make in your Narrative.  
</p><p>1. "I should tremble," say you, (page 21,) "lest 
some bold metaphysician should affirm, that a second justification by 
works is quite consistent with what is contained in Mr. Wesley's 
declaration; but that it is expressed in such <i>strong and absolute terms </i>as must <i>for ever</i> put the most exquisite refinements of metaphysical distinctions <i>at defiance."</i>  
</p><p>ANSWER. "For ever at <i>defiance!</i>" You surprise me, sir: I, who run as perfect a stranger to "<i>exquisite refinements" </i>as to Dr. Crisp's <i>eternal justification, </i>defy you (pardon a <i>bold </i>expression to a <i>bold meta physical) </i>ever
 to produce out of Mr. Wesley's declaration, I shall not say (as you do)
 "strong and absolute terms," but one single word or tittle denying or 
excluding a second justification by works; and I appeal both to your 
second thoughts and to the unprejudiced world, whether these three 
propositions of the declaration, "We have no trust, or confidence, but 
in the alone merits of Christ <i>for </i>justification in the day of' judgment. Works have no part in <i>meriting or purchasing </i>our justification from first to last, <i>either in whole or in part. </i>He is not a real Christian believer, (and consequently cannot be saved,) <i>who does not good works </i>where
 there is time and opportunity." I appeal to the unprejudiced world, 
whether these three propositions are not highly consistent with this 
assertion of our Lord, "By thy words thou shalt be justified," that is, 
"although from first to last the merits of my life and death purchase, 
or deserve, thy justification; yet in the day of judgment thou shalt be 
justified by thy works; that is, thy justification, which is purchased 
by my <i>merits, </i>will entirely turn upon the <i>evidence </i>of thy works, according to the time and opportunity thou hast to do them."  
</p><p>Who does not see, that, "to be justified by the <i>evidence </i>of works," and "to be justified by the <i>merit </i>of works," are no more phrases of the same import than <i>minutes </i>and <i>heresy </i>are
 words of the same signification? The latter proposition contains the 
error strongly guarded against, both in the declaration and the Minutes:
 the former contains an evangelical doctrine, as agreeable to the 
declaration and Minutes as to the Scriptures; a doctrine of which we 
were too sparing when we "leaned too much toward Calvinism," but to 
which, after the example of Mr. Wesley, we are now determined to do 
justice.  
</p><p>Whosoever is "ashamed of Christ's words," we will proclaim them to the world. Both from our pulpits and the press we will say, <i>"By </i>thy
 words thou shalt be condemned." Yea, "Whoever shall say to his brother,
 Thou fool! shall be in danger of hell fire; and whosoever maketh a lie 
shall have his part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone;" 
for as "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness," or 
disbelieveth to unrighteousness, so "with the mouth confession is made 
to salvation," or "hard speeches" are uttered to "damnation." Reserve, 
therefore, Rev. sir, your Public praises for a more proper occasion than
 that which caused their breaking out in your Narrative. "Blessed be 
God!" say you, (page 16,) <i>"Mr. </i>Wesley and fifty-three of his preachers do not agree with Mr. Olivers in the material article of a <i>second justification by works." </i>Indeed, sir, you are greatly mistaken, for we <i>do </i>agree
 with him.; and shall continue so to do, till You have proved he does 
not agree with Jesus Christ, or that our doctrine is not perfectly 
consistent both with the Scriptures and the declaration.  
</p><p>2. Your second objection is not so formal as the 
first; it must be made up of broad hints scattered through your 
Narrative, and they amount to this: "Your pretended difference between 
justification by the <i>merit </i>of works, by the <i>evidence </i>of works, and between a first and a second justification, is founded upon the <i>subtleties of metaphysical distinctions. </i>If what you say wears the aspect of truth, it is because <i>you give a new turn to error, by the almost magical power of metaphysical distinctions," </i>pages 16, 20, 21.  
</p><p>Give me leave, sir, to answer this objection by 
two appeals, one to the most ignorant collier in my parish, and the 
other to your own sensible child; and if they can at once understand my 
meaning, you will see that my "metaphysical distinctions," as you are 
pleased to call them, are nothing but <i>the dictates of common sense. </i>I begin with the collier.  
</p><p>Thomas, I stand here before the judge, accused of 
having robbed the Rev. Mr. Shirley, near Bath, last month, on such an 
evening; can you speak a word for me? Thomas turns to the judge, and 
says, "Please your honour, the accusation is false, for our parson was 
in Madeley Wood; and I can make oath of it, for he even reproved me for 
swearing at our pit's mouth that very evening." By his evidence, the 
judge acquits me. Now, sir, ask cursing Tom whether I am acquitted and <i>justified, </i>by his <i>merits, </i>or by the simple <i>evidence </i>he has given, and he will tell you, "Ay, to be sure by the <i>evidence; </i>though
 I am no scholar, I know very well that if our Methodist parson is not 
hanged, it is none of my deservings." Thus, sir, an ignorant collier, as
 great a stranger to <i>your metaphysics </i>as you are to <i>his mandrel, </i>discovers at once a material difference between justification by the <i>evidence, </i>and justification by the <i>merits </i>of a witness.  
</p><p>My second appeal is to your sensible child. By a 
plain comparison I hope to make him at once understand, both the 
difference there is between our first and second justification, and the 
propriety of that difference. The lovely boy is old enough, I suppose, 
to follow the gardener and me to yonder nursery. Having shown him the 
operation of <i>grafting, </i>and pointing at the crab tree newly 
grafted, "My dear child," would I say, "though hitherto this tree has 
produced nothing but crabs, yet by the skill of the gardener, who has 
just fixed in it that good little branch, it is now made an <i>apple tree: </i>I <i>justify </i>and warrant it such. (Here is an emblem of our <i>first </i>justification <i>by faith!) </i>In three or four years, if we live, we will come again and see it: if it thrives and 'bears fruit,' <i>well; </i>we
 shall then by that mark justify it a second time, we shall declare that
 it is a good apple tree indeed, and fit to be transplanted from this 
wild nursery into a delightful orchard. But if we find that the old crab
 stock, instead of nourishing the graft, spends all its sap in producing
 wild shoots and sour crabs; or if it is a 'tree whose fruit withereth, 
without fruit, twice dead, (dead in the graft and in the stock,) plucked
 up by the root,' or quite cankered, far from declaring 'it a good 
tree,' we shall pass sentence of condemnation upon it, and say, ' Cut it
 down; why cumbereth it the ground? For every tree that bringeth not 
forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.'" Here is an 
emblem of our <i>second </i>justification <i>by </i>works, or of the 
condemnation that will infallibly overtake those Laodicean professors 
and wretched apostates, whose faith is not shown by works, where there 
is time and opportunity.  
</p><p>Instead of offering an insult to your superior 
understanding, in attempting to explain by "metaphysical distinctions," 
what I suppose your sensible child has already understood by the help of
 a grafting knife, I shall leave you to consider whether Scripture, 
reason, and candour do not join their influence to make you acknowledge,
 at least, in the court of your own conscience, that you have put a 
wrong construction upon Mr. Wesley's declaration as upon his Minutes, 
and by that mean inadvertently given another <i>rash </i>touch to the ark of practical religion, and to the character of one of the greatest ministers in the world.  
</p><p>I am, with due respect, Hon. and Rev. sir, your obedient servant, in the bond of the practical Gospel of Christ,  
</p><p>THE VINDICATOR.
</p>

<h2>LETTER II.</h2>
<p>HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR,--Having endeavoured in my last to do justice to the practical Gospel of Christ, and <i>Mr. </i>Wesley's
 awful declarations, I pass on to the other mistakes of your Narrative. 
That which strikes me next is "the public recantation of your <i>useful </i>sermons, in the face of the whole world." (Page 22.)  
</p><p>1. 0! sir, what have you done! Do you not know 
that your sermons contain not only the legally evangelical doctrine of 
the Minutes, but likewise all the doctrine which moderate Calvinists 
esteem as the marrow of the Gospel? And shall all be treated alike? 
"Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? That be far from 
thee to do after this manner!" Thus did a good man formerly plead the 
cause of a <i>wicked </i>city, and thus I plead that of your <i>good </i>sermons,
 those twelve valuable, though unripe fruits of your ministerial 
labours. Upon this plea the infamous city would have been spared, had 
only "ten" good men been found in it. Now, sir, spare a valuable book 
for the sake of a "thousand" excellent things it contains. But if you 
are inflexible, and still wish it "burned," imitate, at least, the kind 
angels who sent Lot out of the fiery overthrow, and except all the 
evangelical pages of the unfortunate volume.  
</p><p>Were it not ridiculous to compare wars which cost 
us only a little ink, and our friends a few pence, to those which cost 
armies their blood, and kingdoms their treasures, I would be tempted to 
say to you, Imitate the Dutch in their last effort to balance the 
victory, and secure the field. When they are pressed by the French, 
rather than yield, they break their dykes, let in the sea upon 
themselves, and lay all their fine gardens and rich pastures under 
water: but before they have recourse to that strange expedient, they 
prudently save all the valuable goods they can. Why should you not 
follow them in their prudential care, as you seem to do in their bold 
stratagem? When you publicly lay your useful book under the bitter 
waters of an anathema, why do you save absolutely nothing? Why must 
Gospel truths, more precious than the wealth of Holland and the gold of 
Ophir, lie for ever under the severe scourge of your recantation? 
Suppose you had "recanted" your third sermon. <i>The way to eternal </i>life, in opposition to mysticism; and "burned" the fourth, <i>Salvation by Christ for Jews and Gentiles, </i>in honour of Calvinism, could you not have spared the rest?  
</p><p>If you say, you may do what you please with your 
own; I answer, Your book, publicly exposed to sale, and bought perhaps 
by thousands, is, in one sense, no more your own; it belongs to the 
purchasers, before whom you lay, I fear, a dangerous example: for when 
they shall hear that the author has "publicly recanted it in the face of
 the whole world," it will be a temptation to them to slight the Gospel 
it contains, and perhaps to ridicule it "in the face of the whole 
world."  
</p><p>You add, "It savours too strongly of mysticism." 
Some passages are a little tainted with Mr. Law's capital error, and you
 might have pointed them out: but if you think mysticism is 
intrinsically bad, you are under a mistake. One of the greatest Mystics,
 next to Solomon, is Thomas a Kempis, and a few errors excepted, I would
 no more burn his" Imitation of Jesus Christ," than <i>the Song of Solomon, </i>and Mr. Romaine's edifying" Paraphrase of the 107th Psalm."  
</p><p>You urge also, your sermons "savour too much of free <i>will." </i>alas! sir, can you recant "free will?" Was not your will as <i>free </i>when
 you recanted your sermons as when you composed them'? Is there not as 
much free will expressed in this one line of the Gospel as in all your 
sermons, "I would have gathered you, and ye would not'?" Do not 
"free-will offerings, with a holy worship," delight the Lord more than <i>forced, </i>and, if I may be allowed the expression, <i>bond-will </i>services?
 Is not the free will with which the martyrs went to the stake as worthy
 of our highest admiration, as the mysticism of the Canticles is of our 
deepest attention'? If all that strongly "savours of free will" must be 
"burned," ye heavens! what Smithfield work will there be in your lucid 
plains! Woe to saints! Woe to angels! for they are all free-willing 
beings--all full of free will. Nor can you deny it, unless you suppose 
they are <i>bound </i>by irresistible decrees, as the heathens fancied their deities were <i>hampered </i>with the adamantine chains of an imaginary something they called "fate:" witness their <i>Fata vetant, </i>and <i>Fata jubent, </i>and <i>ineluclabile Fatum.</i>  
</p><p>Pardon, Rev. sir, the oddity of these 
exclamations. I am so grieved at the great advantage we give infidels 
against the Gospel, by making it ridiculous, that I could try even the 
method of Horace, to bring my friends back from the fashionable 
refinements of Crisp, to the plain truth as it is in Jesus. <i> </i>
</p><p><i>Ridiculum acri</i> <i> </i>
</p><p><i>Fortius ac melius stultas plerumque secat res.</i>  
</p><p>Nor is this the only bad tendency of your new 
doctrine: for by exploding the freedom of the will, you rob us of free 
agency. You afford the wicked, who determine to continue in sin, the 
best excuse in the world to do it without either shame or remorse; you 
make us mere machines, and indirectly reflect upon the wisdom of our 
Lord, for saying to a set of Jewish machines, "I would, and ye would 
not." But what is still more deplorable, you inadvertently represent it 
an unwise thing in God to judge the world in righteousness; and your <i>new </i>glass
 shows his vindictive justice in the same unfavourable light, in which 
England saw two years ago the behaviour of a great monarch, who was 
exposed in the public papers, for unmercifully cutting with a whip, and 
tearing with spurs, the horses worked in a tapestry of his royal 
apartment, because they did not prance and gallop at his nod.  
</p><p>If a commendable, but immoderate fear of Pelagius'
 doctrine drove you into that of Augustine, the oracle of all the 
Dominicans, Thomists, Jansenists, and all other Roman Catholic 
predestinarians, you need not go so far beyond him as to recant all your
 sermons, because you mention perhaps three or four times, the freedom 
of our will, in the whole volume. "Let no one," says judicious 
Melancthon, "be offended at the words free will, <i>(liberum arbitriurn,) </i>for St. Augustine himself uses it in many volumes, and that almost in every page, even to the surfeit of the reader."  
</p><p>The most ingenious Calvinist that ever wrote 
against free will is, I think, Mr. Edwards, of New-England. And his fine
 system. turns upon a comparison by which it may be overturned, and the 
freedom of the will demonstrated.  
</p><p>The will, says he, (if I remember right,) is like an even balance which can never turn without a weight, and must <i>necessarily </i>turn with one. But whence comes the weight that <i>necessarily </i>turns
 it? From the understanding, answers he; the last dictate of the 
understanding necessarily turns the will. And is the understanding also 
necessarily determined'? Yes, by the effect which the objects around us 
necessarily have upon us, and by the circumstances in which we 
necessarily find ourselves; so that from first to last, our tempers, 
words, and actions, necessarily follow each other, and the circumstances
 that give them birth, as the second, third, and fourth links of a chain
 follow the first, when it is drawn along. Hence the eternal, 
infallible, irresistible, universal concatenation of events, both in the
 moral and material world. This is, if I mistake not, the scheme of that
 great' divine, and he spends no less than four hundred and fourteen 
large pages in trying to establish it.  
</p><p>I would just observe upon it, that it makes the First Cause or First Mover, the only free <i>Agent </i>in
 the world; all others being necessarily bound with the chain of his 
decrees, drawn along by the irresistible motion of his arm, or, which is
 the same, entangled in <i>forcible </i>circumstances unalterably fixed by his immutable counsel.  
</p><p>And yet, even upon this scheme, you needed not, 
sir, be so afraid of free will; for if the will be like an even balance,
 it is free in itself, though it is only with what I beg leave to call 
"a mechanical freedom;" for an even balance, you know, is <i>free </i>to turn either way.  
</p><p>But with respect to our ingenious author's 
assertion, that the will cannot turn without a weight, because an even 
balance cannot, I must consider it as a mere begging the question, if 
not as an absurdity. What is a balance but <i>lifeless matter? </i>And what is the will but <i>the </i>living, <i>active soul, springing up in its willing capacity, and self-exerting, self-determining power? O </i>how
 tottering is the mighty fabric raised, I shall not say upon such a fine
 spun metaphysical speculation, but Upon so weak a foundation as a 
comparison, which supposes that two things, so widely different as 
spirit and matter, a <i>living soul </i>and <i>a lifeless balance, </i>are
 exactly alike with reference to self determination! Just as if a 
spirit, made after the image of the living, free, and powerful God, was 
no more capable of determining itself, than a horizontal beam supporting
 two equal copper bowls by six silken strings!  
</p><p>I am sorry, sir, to dissent from such a 
respectable divine as yourself; but, as I have no taste for new 
refinements, and cannot even conceive how far actions can be <i>morally </i>good
 or evil, any farther than our free will is concerned in them, I must 
follow the universal experience of mankind, and side with the author of 
the sermons against the author of the Narrative concerning the freedom 
of the will.  
</p><p>Nor is this freedom derogatory to free grace: for 
as it was free grace that gave an upright free will to Adam at his 
creation; so whenever his fallen children think or act aright, it is 
because their free will is mercifully prevented, touched, and so far 
rectified by free grace.  
</p><p>However, it must be granted, that many fashionable
 professors, and the large book of Mr. Edwards, are for you: but when 
you maintained <i>the freedom of the will, </i>Jesus Christ and the 
Gospel were on your side. To the end of the world this plain, peremptory
 assertion of our Lord, "I would and ye would not," will alone throw 
down the sophisms, and silence the objections of the most subtle 
philosophers against free will. When I consider what it implies, far 
from supposing that the will is a lifeless pair of scales, necessarily 
turned by the least weight, I see it is such a strong, self-determining 
power, that it can resist the effect of the most amazing weights; keep 
itself inflexible under all the warnings, threatenings, miracles, 
promises, entreaties, and tears of the Son of God; and remain 
obstinately unmoved under the strivings of his Holy Spirit. Yes: put in 
one scale the most stupendous weights, for instance, the hopes of 
heavenly joys, and the dread of hellish torments; and only the gaudy 
feather of honour, or the breaking bubble of worldly joy, in the other; 
if the will casts itself into the light scale, the feather or bubble 
will instantly preponderate. Nor is the power of the rectified will less
 wonderful; for though you should put all the kingdoms of the world and 
their glory in the one scale, and nothing but "the reproach of Christ" 
in the .other; yet, if the will <i>freely </i>leap into the infamous 
scale, a crown of thorns easily outweighs a thousand golden crowns, and a
 devouring flame makes ten thousand thrones kick the beam.  
</p><p>Thus it appears the will can be persuaded, but 
never forced. You may bend it by moral suasions; but if you do this 
farther than it freely gives way, you <i>break, </i>you absolutely <i>destroy </i>it. A will forced, is no more a <i>will; </i>it is mere <i>compulsion; </i>freedom
 is not less essential to it than moral agency to man. Nor do I go, in 
these observations upon the freedom of the will, one step farther than 
honest John Bunyan, whom all the Calvinists so deservedly admire. In his
 "Holy War" he tells us, "There is but one <i>Lord Will-be Will </i>in the town of Man's.. soul:" whether he serves Diabolus or Shaddai, he is <i>Lord Will-be Will </i>still,
 "a man of great strength, resolution, and courage, whom in his occasion
 no one can turn," if he does not freely turn, or yield to be turned.  
</p><p>I hope, sir, these hints upon the harmlessness of 
mysticism, and the important doctrine of our free agency, will convince 
you, and the purchasers of your sermons, that you have been too 
precipitate in "publicly recanting them in the face of the whole world,"
 especially <i>the ninth.</i>  
</p><p>If you ask, why I particularly interest myself in 
behalf of that one discourse, I will let you into the mystery. At the 
first reading I liked and adopted it: I cut it out of the volume in 
which it was bound, put it in my sermon case, and preached it in my 
church. The title of it is, you know, "Justification by Faith;" and, 
among several striking things on the subject, you quote twice this 
excellent passage out of our homilies: "Justification by faith implies a
 sure trust and confidence which a man hath in God, that by the <i>merits </i>of
 Christ his sins are forgiven, and he is reconciled to the favour of 
God." O sir, why did you not except it in your recantation, both for the
 honour of our Church and your own'?  
</p><p>Were I to print and disperse such an advertisement as this: "Eight years ago I preached in my church a sermon, entitled <i>Justification by Faith, </i>composed by the honourable and reverend Mr. Shirley, to convince Papists and Pharisees that we are accepted through the alone <i>merits </i>of Christ: but I see better now; <i>I wish this sermon had been burned, and I publicly recant it in the face of the whole world;</i>" how would the Popish priest of Madeley rejoice! And how will that of Loughrea triumph when he hears <i>you </i>have
 actually done it in your Narrative! What will your Protestant 
parishioners, to whom your book is dedicated, say, when the surprising 
news reaches Ireland? And what will the world think, when they see you 
warmly plead in August for <i>justification by faith, </i>as being "the 
foundation that must by all means be secured;" and publicly recant, in 
September, your own excellent sermon on "Justification by Faith?"  
</p><p>Indeed, sir, though I admire your candour in 
acknowledging there are some exceptionable passages in your discourses, 
and your humility in readily giving them up, I can no more approve of 
your readiness in making, than in insisting upon "formal recantations." 
We cannot be too careful in dealing in that kind of ware; and it is 
extremely dangerous to do it by wholesale; as by that mean we may give 
up, or <i>seem </i>to give up, "before the whole world," precious 
truths, delivered by Christ himself, and brought down to us in streams 
of the blood of martyrs.  
</p><p>Among some blunt expostulations that Mr. Wesley 
erased in my Fifth Letter, as being too severe, he kindly but unhappily 
struck out this:  
</p><p>"Before you could with candour insist upon 'a 
recantation' of Mr. Wesley's Minutes, should you not have recanted 
yourself the passages of your own sermons where the same doctrines are 
maintained; and have sent your recantation through the land, together 
with your Circular Letter'?" Had this been published, it might have 
convinced you of the unseasonableness of your "recantation." Thus, this <i>second hasty step </i>would have been prevented; and if I dwell so long upon it now, believe me, sir, it is chiefly to prevent a <i>third.</i>  
</p><p>And, now your sermons are recanted, is the 
Vindication of Mr. Wesley's Minutes invalidated? Not at all; for you 
have not yet recanted the Bath Hymnbook, nor can you ever get Mr. Henry,
 Mr. Williams, and a tribe of other anti-Crispian, though Calvinist 
divines, flow in glory, to recant 'with you; much less the prophets, 
apostles, and Christ himself, on whose irrefragable testimony we chiefly
 rest our doctrine.  
</p><p>II. As I have pleaded out the cause of free will 
against bound will, or that of your sermons against your Narrative, and 
am insensibly come to the Vindication, give me leave, sir, to speak a 
word also for that performance and the author of it.  
</p><p>You say he has <i>"attempted </i>a vindication of the Minutes;" but do not some people think he has likewise <i>executed </i>it'? And have you proved he has not?  
</p><p>You reply, "There would he a great impropriety in 
my giving a full and particular answer to those letters, because the 
author did all he could to revoke them, and has given me ample 
satisfaction in his letters of submission." Indeed, sir, you quite 
mistook the nature of that "submission:" it had absolutely no reference 
to the <i>arguments </i>of the Vindication; it only respected the <i>polemic dress </i>in
 which the vindicator had put them. You might have been convinced of it 
by this paragraph of his letter of submission: "I was going to preach 
when I had the news of your happy accommodation, and was no sooner out 
of church than I wrote to beg my Vindication might not appear in the <i>dress </i>in which I had put it. I did not then, nor do I yet, repent having written upon the Minutes; but, <i>as matters are now, </i>I
 am very sorry I did not write in a general manner, without taking 
notice of the Circular Letter, and mentioning your dear name." He begs, 
therefore, you will not consider his letter of submission as a reason 
for not giving "a full or particular answer" to his <i>arguments. </i>On the contrary, if you can prove they want solidity, <i>a letter of thanks </i>shall follow his "letter of submission:" if he is wrong, he sincerely desires to be set right.  
</p><p>You add, however, that he has "broken the Minutes 
into sentences and half sentences; and by refining upon each of the 
detached particles, has given a new turn to the whole." But he appeals 
to every impartial reader whether he has not, like a candid man, first 
considered them all together, and then every one asunder. He begs to be 
informed, whether an artist can better inquire into the goodness of a 
watch, than by making first his observations on the whole movement in 
general, and then by taking it to pieces, that he may examine every part
 with greater attention. And he desires you would show, whether what you
 are pleased to call "a new turn," is not preferable to the <i>heretical turn </i>some
 persons give them; and whether it is not equally, if not better adapted
 to the literal meaning of the words, as well as more agreeable to the 
Antinomian state of the Church, the general tenor of the propositions, 
and the system of doctrine maintained by Mr. Wesley for near forty 
years?  
</p><p>The vindicator objects likewise to your asserting,
 (page 21,) that "when he first saw the Minutes, he expressed to Lady 
Huntingdon his <i>abhorrence </i>of them." Had you said SURPRISE, the expression would have been strictly just; but that of <i>abhorrence </i>is far too strong. her ladyship, who testified her <i>detestation </i>of them in the strongest terms, might easily mistake his <i>abhorrence </i>of
 the sense fixed upon the Minutes, for an abhorrence of the Minutes 
themselves; but she may recollect, that, far from ever granting they had
 that sense, he said again and again, even in their first conversation 
upon them, "Certainly, my lady, Mr. Wesley can mean no such thing: he 
will explain himself."  
</p><p>But supposing he had a first been so far influenced by the jealous fears of Lady Huntingdon, as to express as great an <i>abhorrence </i>of
 the Minutes as the mistaken disciples did of the person of our Lord, 
when they took him for an apparition, and "cried out for fear;" would 
this have excused either him or you, sir, for resolutely continuing in a
 mistake, in the midst of a variety of means and calls to escape from 
it? And if the vindicator, before he had weighed the Minutes in the 
balance of the sanctuary, had even taken his pen, and condemned them as 
dangerously legal, what could you fairly have concluded from it, but 
that he was not partial to Mr. Wesley, and had also "leaned so much 
toward Calvinism," as not instantly to discover, and "rejoice in the 
truth'?"  
</p><p>In your last page you take your friendly leave of 
the vindicator, by saying, you "desire in love to cast a veil over all 
apparent mistakes of his judgment on this occasion;" but as he is not 
conscious of "all these apparent mistakes," he begs you would in love 
take off" the veil" you have cast upon them, that he may see, and 
rectify at least those which are capital.  
</p><p>III. And that you may not hastily conclude he was "mistaken" in his Vindication of that article that touches upon <i>merit, </i>he
 embraces this opportunity of presenting you with another quotation from
 the JOHN WESLEY of the last century, he means Mr. BAXTER, the most 
judicious divine, as well as the greatest, most useful, and most 
laborious preacher of his age.  
</p><p>In his "Catholic Theology," answering the objections of an Antinomian, he says: <i>"Merit </i>is
 a word, I perceive, you are against; you may therefore choose any other
 of the same signification, and we will forbear this rather than offend 
you. But yet tell me, (1.) What, if the words axios and axia were 
translated <i>deserving </i>and <i>merit, </i>would it not be as true a translation as <i>worthy </i>and <i>worthiness, </i>when
 it is the same thing that is meant'? (2.) Do not all the ancient 
teachers of the Churches, since the apostles, particularly apply the 
names<i> </i>axia<i> </i>and m<i>eritum </i>to believers? And if you 
persuade men that all these teachers were Papists, will you not persuade
 most that believe you to be Papists too? (3.) Are not <i>reward, </i>and <i>merit </i>or <i>desert, </i>relative words, as <i>punishment </i>and <i>guilt, in aster </i>and <i>servant, husband </i>and <i>wife? </i>And is there any reward which is not <i>meriti praemum, </i>"the reward of some merit'?" Again:  
</p><p>"Is it not the second article of our faith, and 
next to 'believing there is a God,' that 'he is the rewarder of them 
that diligently seek him 'P When you thus extirpate faith and godliness,
 on pretence of crying down <i>merit, </i>you see what <i>overdoing </i>tends to. And indeed by the same reason that men deny a <i>reward </i>to duty, (the faultiness being pardoned through Christ,) they would infer there is no <i>punishment </i>for sin;<i> </i>for
 if God will not do good to the righteous, neither will he do evil to 
the wicked; he becomes like the god of Epicurus, he does not trouble 
himself about us, nor about the merit or demerit of our actions. But 
David knew better: 'The Lord,' says he, 'plenteously rewardeth the proud
 doers; and verily there is a reward for the righteous, for there is a 
God that judgeth the earth;' that sees matter of praise or dispraise, 
rewardableness or worthiness of punishment, in all the actions of men." 
This is, sir, all Mr. Baxter and Mr. Wesley rnean by <i>merit </i>or <i>demerit; </i>and if the vindicator be wrong in thinking they are both in the right, please to remove "the veil" that conceals his "mistake."  
</p><p>IV. As one of his correspondents desires him to explain himself a little more upon the article of the Minutes which respects <i>undervaluing ourselves; </i>and
 as you probably place the arguments he has advanced upon that head 
among his "apparent mistakes," he takes likewise this opportunity of 
making some additional observations on that delicate subject.  
</p><p>How we can "esteem every man better than 
ourselves," and ourselves "the chief of sinners," or "the least of 
saints," seems not so much a calculation for the understanding, as for 
the lowly, contrite, and loving heart. It puzzles the former, but the 
latter at once makes it out. Nevertheless, the seeming contradiction 
may, perhaps, be reconciled to reason by these reflections:--  
</p><p>1. If friendship brings the greatest monarch down 
from his throne, and makes him sit on the same couch with his 
favourites; may not brotherly love, much more powerful than natural 
friendship; may not humility, excited by the example of Christ washing 
his disciples' feet; may not a deep regard for that precept, "He that 
will be greatest among you, let him be the least of all," sink the true 
Christian to the dust, and make him lie in spirit at the feet of every 
one  
</p><p>2. A well-bred person uncovers himself, bows, and 
declares, even to his inferiors, that he is their "most humble servant."
 This affected civility of the world is but an apish imitation of the 
genuine humility of the Church; and if those who customarily speak 
humble words without meaning, may yet be honest men, how much more the 
saints, who have "truth written in their inward parts," and "speak out 
of the abundance of their <i>humble </i>hearts 1"  
</p><p>3. He who walks in the light of Divine love, sees 
something of God's spiritual, moral, or natural image in all men, the 
worst not excepted; and at the sight, that which is merely creaturely in
 him, (by a kind of spiritual instinct found in all who are "born of the
 Spirit,") directly bows to that which is of God in another. 1-le 
imitates the captain of a first rate man of war, who, upon seeing the 
king or queen coming up in a small boat, forgetting the enormous size of
 his ship, or considering it is the king's own ship, immediately strikes
 his colours; and the greater vessel, consistently with wisdom and 
truth, pays respect to the less.  
</p><p>4. The most eminent saint, having known more of 
the workings of corruption in his own breast, than he can possibly know 
of them in that of any other man, may, with great truth, (according to 
his present views and firmer feelings of the internal evil he has 
overcome,) call himself "the chief of sinners."  
</p><p>5. Nor does he know, but if the feeblest believers
 had all his talents and graces, with all his opportunities of doing and
 receiving good, they would have made far superior advances in the 
Christian life; and in this view also, without hypocritical humility, he
 prefers the least saint to himself. Thus, although, according to the 
humble light of <i>others, </i>all true believers certainly "undervalue," yet, according to <i>their own </i>humble light, they make a true estimate of "themselves."  
</p><p>V. The vindicator having thus solved a problem of 
godliness, which you have undoubtedly ranked among his "apparent 
mistakes," he takes the liberty of presenting you with a list of some of
 <i>your own </i>"apparent mistakes on this occasion."  
</p><p>1. In the very letter in which you recant your 
Circular Letter, you desire Mr. Wesley to "give up the fatal errors of 
the Minutes," though you have not yet <i>proved </i>they contain One; 
you still affirm, "They appear to you evidently subversive of the 
fundamentals of Christianity," that is, in plain English, still 
"dreadfully heretical;" and you produce a letter which asserts, also, 
without shadow of proof, that the "Minutes were given for the 
establishment of another foundation than that which is laid;" that they 
are "repugnant to Scripture, the whole plan of man's salvation under the
 new covenant of grace, and also to the clear meaning of our Established
 Church, as well as to all other Protestant Churches."  
</p><p>2. You declare in your Narrative that, "when you 
cast your eye over the Minutes, you are just where you was," and assure 
the public, that "nothing inferior to an <i>attack upon the foundation </i>of
 our hope, through the all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ, could have 
been an object sufficient to engage you in its defence." Thus, by 
continuing to insinuate such an ATTACK was really made, you continue to 
wound Mr. Wesley in the tenderest part.  
</p><p>3. Although Mr. Wesley and fifty-three of his 
fellow labourers have let you quietly "secure the foundation," (which, 
by the by, had only been shaken in your own ideas, and was perfectly 
secured by these express words of the Minutes, "not by the merit of 
works," but by "believing in Christ,") yet, far from allowing them to <i>secure the superstructure </i>in
 their turn, which would be nothing but just, you begin already a 
contest with them about "our second justification by works in the day of
 judgment."  
</p><p>4. Instead of frankly acknowledging the rashness 
of your step, and the greatness of your mistake, with respect to the 
Minutes, you make a bad matter worse, by treating the Declaration as you
 have treated them; forcing upon it a dangerous sense, no less contrary 
to the Scriptures, than to Mr. Wesley's meaning, and the import of the 
words.  
</p><p>5. When you speak of the dreadful charges you have brought against the Minutes, you softly call them "misconstructions you <i>may seem </i>to
 have made of their meaning." (Page 22, line 4.) Nor is your 
"acknowledgment" much stronger than your "may seem;" at least it does 
not appear, to many, adequate to the hurt done by your Circular Letter 
to the practical Gospel of Christ, and the reputation of his eminent 
servant, thousands of whose friends you have grieved, offended, or 
stumbled; while you have confirmed thousands of his enemies in their 
hard thoughts of him, and in their unjust contempt of his ministry.  
</p><p>6. And, lastly, far from candidly inquiring into 
the merit of the arguments advanced in the Vindication, you represent 
them as mere "metaphysical distinctions;" or cast, as a veil over them, a
 friendly submissive <i>letter of condolence, </i>which was never intended for the use to which you have put it.  
</p><p>Therefore the vindicator, who does not admire a 
peace founded upon a "may seem" on your part, and on Mr. Wesley's part 
upon a "declaration," to which you have already fixed a wrong 
unscriptural sense of your own, takes this public method to inform you, 
he thinks his arguments in favour of Mr. Wesley's anti-Crispian 
propositions rational, Scriptural, and solid; and once more he begs you 
would remove the veil you have hitherto "cast over all the apparent 
mistakes of his judgment on this occasion," that he may see whether the <i>Antinomian </i>gospel of Dr. Crisp is preferable to the <i>practical </i>Gospel which Mr. Wesley endeavours to restore to its primitive and Scriptural lustre.  
</p><p>VI. Having thus finished my remarks upon the 
mistakes of your Narrative, I gladly take my leave of controversy for 
this time. Would to God it were for ever! I no more like it than I do 
applying a caustic to the back of my friends; it is disagreeable to me, 
and painful to them; and nevertheless, it must be done, when their 
health and mine is at stake.  
</p><p>I assure you, sir, I do not like the warlike dress
 of the vindicator, any more than David did the heavy armour of Saul. 
With gladness, therefore, I cast it aside, to throw myself at your feet,
 and protest to you, that, although I thought it my <i>duty </i>to write to you with the utmost <i>plainness, frankness, </i>and <i>honesty, </i>yet the design of doing it with <i>bitterness </i>never
 entered my heart. However, for every "bitter expression" that may have 
dropped from my sharp vindicating pen, I ask your pardon; but it must be
 <i>in general, </i>for neither friends nor foes have yet <i>particularly </i>pointed out to me <i>one </i>such expression.  
</p><p>You have accepted of <i>"a letter </i>of submission" from me; let, I beseech you, a concluding <i>paragraph </i>of submission meet also with your favourable acceptance. You condescend, Rev. sir, to call me your "learned friend." <i>Learning </i>is an accomplishment I never pretended to; but your <i>friendship </i>is
 an honour I shall always highly esteem, and do at this time value above
 my own brother's love. Appearances are a little against me: I feel I am
 a thorn in your flesh; but I am persuaded it is a <i>necessary </i>one, and this persuasion reconciles me to the thankless and disagreeable part I act.  
</p><p>If Ephraim must vex Judah, let Judah bear with 
Ephraim, till, happily tired of their contention, they feel the truth of
 Terence's words, <i>Amantium </i>(why not <i>credentiun?) irae amoris redintegratio est.* </i>I
 can assure you, my dear sir, without metaphysical distinction, I love 
and honour you, as truly as I dislike the rashness of your well-meant 
zeal. The motto I thought myself obliged to follow was <i>E bello pax;</i>** but that which I delight in is, <i>In bello pax;</i>*** may we make them harmonize till we learn war and polemic divinity no more!  
</p><p>* [The misunderstandings of lovers (why not of <i>believers) </i>end in a renewal and increase of love.]  
</p><p>** [We make war in order to get peace.]  
</p><p>*** [We enjoy peace in the midst of war.]  
</p><p>My Vindication cost me tears of fear, lest I 
should have wounded you too deeply. That fear, I find, was groundless; 
but should you feel a little for the great truths and the great minister
 I vindicate, these expostulations will wound me, and probably cost me 
tears again.  
</p><p>If, in the meantime, we offend our weak brethren, 
let us do something in order to lessen the offence till it is removed. 
Let us show them we make war without so much as shyness. Should you ever
 come to the next county, as you did last summer, honour me with a line,
 and I shall gladly wait upon you, and show you, (if you permit me,) the
 way to my pulpit, where I shall think myself highly favoured to see you
 "secure the foundation," and hear you enforce the doctrine of <i>justification by faith, </i>which
 you fear we attack. And should I ever be within thirty miles of the 
city where you reside, I shall go to submit myself to you, and beg leave
 to assist you in reading prayers for you, or giving the cup with you. 
Thus shall we convince the world, that controversy may be 
conscientiously carried on without interruption of brotherly love; and I
 shall have the peculiar pleasure of testifying to you, in person, how 
sincerely I am, Hon. and dear sir, your submissive and obedient servant,
 in the bond of a PRACTICAL Gospel,  
</p><p>J. FLETCHER. </p>
<h2>LETTER III. <h2>

<p>HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR,--If I mistake not the 
workings of my heart, a concern for St. James' "pure and undefiled 
religion" excites me to take the pen once more, and may account for the 
readiness with which I have met you in the dangerous field of 
controversy. You may possibly think mere partiality to Mr. Wesley has 
inspired me with that boldness; and others may be ready to say as Eliab,
 "We know the pride and naughtiness of thy heart. Thou art come down 
that thou mightest see the battle." But may I not answer with David, "Is
 there not a cause?"  
</p><p>Is it not highly necessary to make a stand against
 Antinomianism? Is not that gigantic "man of sin" a more dangerous enemy
 to King Jesus, than the champion of the Philistines was to King Saul? 
Has he not defied more than forty days the armies and arms, the people 
and truths of the living God? By audaciously daring the thousands in 
Israel, has he not made all the faint hearted among them ashamed to 
stand "in the whole armour of God," afraid to defend the important post 
of <i>duty? </i>And have not many left it already, openly running away, 
flying into the dens and caves of earthly mindedness, "putting their 
light under a bushel," and even burying themselves alive in the noisome 
grave of profaneness?  
</p><p>Multitudes indeed still keep the field, still make
 an open profession of godliness. But how few of these "endure hardship 
as good. soldiers of Jesus Christ!" How many have already cast away "the
 shield of <i>Gospel </i>faith, the faith which works by love!" What numbers dread the <i>cross, </i>the
 heavenly standard they should steadily bear, or resolutely follow! 
While in pompous speeches they extol the cross of Jesus, how do they, 
upon the most frivolous pretence, refuse to "take up" their own! Did the
 massy staff of Goliah's spear seem more terrible to the frighted 
Israelites than <i>the daily cross </i>of those dastardly followers of 
the Crucified? What Boanerges can spirit them up, and lead them on "from
 conquering to conquer?" Who can even make them look the enemy n the 
face? Alas! "in their hearts they are <i>already </i>gone back to Egypt. Their faces are <i>but half </i>Sion
 ward." They give way,-- they "draw back;" O may it not be "to 
perdition!" May not the king of terrors overtake them in their retreat, 
and make them as great monuments of God's vengeance against cowardly 
soldiers, as Lot's wife was of his indignation against halting racers!  
</p><p>But setting allegory aside, permit me, sir, to 
pour my fears into your bosom, and tell you with the utmost plainness my
 distressing thoughts of the religious world.  
</p><p>For some years I have suspected there is more 
imaginary than "unfeigned faith" in most of those who pass for 
believers. With a mixture of indignation and grief have I seen them 
carelessly follow the stream of corrupt nature, against which they 
should have manfully wrestled. And by the most preposterous mistake, 
when they should have exclaimed against their <i>Antinomianism,* </i>I have heard them cry out against "the <i>legality** </i>of their wicked hearts; which" they said "still suggested they were to <i>do something </i>in
 order to salvation." Glad was I, therefore, when I had attentively 
considered Mr. Wesley's Minutes, to find they were levelled at the very 
errors which give rise to an evil I had long lamented in secret, but had
 wanted courage to resist and attack.  
</p><p>* [The word Antinomianism is derived from two Greek words, <i>anti </i>and <i>nomos, </i>which signify "against the law," and the word <i>"legal" </i>from the Latin <i>legalis, </i>which means "agreeable to the law."]  
</p><p>** [The <i>legality </i>contended for in these letters is not a <i>stumbling at Christ, </i>and a <i>going about to establish our own righteousness </i>by faithless works: this sin, which the Scripture calls <i>unbelief, </i>I
 would no more countenance than murder. The evangelical legality I want 
to see all in love with, is a cleaving to Christ by faith which <i>works righteousness; </i>a "following him as he went about doing good;" and a showing by St. James' <i>works </i>that we have St. Paul's faith.]  
</p><p>I. This evil is <i>Antinomianism; </i>that is, any kind of doctrinal or practical <i>opposition to God's law, </i>which
 is the perfect rule of right, and the moral picture of the God of love,
 drawn in miniature by our Lord in these two exquisite precepts, "Thou 
shalt love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself."  
</p><p>As "the law is good, if a man use it lawfully," so <i>legality </i>is
 excellent, if it be evangelical. The external respect shown by 
Pharisees to the law is but feigned and hypocritical legality. Pharisees
 are no more truly legal, than Antinomians are truly evangelical. "Had 
ye believed Moses," says Jesus to people of that stamp, "ye would have 
believed me:" but in your hearts you hate his law as much as you do my 
Gospel.  
</p><p>We see no less Gospel in the preface of the ten 
commandments, "I am the ,Lord thy God," &amp;c, than we do legality in 
the middle of our Lord's sermon on the mount, "I say, Whosoever looketh 
on a woman to lust after her, bath already committed adultery in his 
heart." Nevertheless, the latter "has in all things the pre-eminence" 
over the former. For if "the law," shortly prefaced by the Gospel, "came
 by Moses;" <i>grace, </i>the gracious, the full display of the Gospel, <i>and truth, </i>the true explanation and fulfilling of the law, "came by Jesus Christ."  
</p><p>This evangelical law should appear to us "sweeter 
than the honeycomb, and more precious than fine gold." We should 
continually spread the tables of our hearts before our heavenly 
Lawgiver, beseeching him to write it there with his own finger, the 
powerful Spirit of Life and love. But alas! God's commandments are 
disregarded; they are represented as the needless or impracticable 
sanctions of that superannuated legalist, Moses; and if we express our 
veneration for them, we are looked upon as people who are always 
strangers to the Gospel, or are fallen into the Galatian state.  
</p><p>Not so David. He was so great an admirer of God's 
law, that he declares the godly man "doth meditate therein day and 
night.' He expresses his transcendent value for it, under the synonymous
 expressions of <i>law, words, statutes, testimonies, precepts, </i>and <i>commandments, </i>in almost every verse of the 119th Psalm. And he says of himself, "0 how I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day!"  
</p><p>St. Paul was as evangelically legal as David; for 
he knew the law is as much contained in the Gospel, as the tables of 
stone, on which the moral law was written, were contained in the ark. He
 therefore assured the Corinthians, that "though he had all faith," even
 that which is most uncommon, and performed the greatest wonders, it 
would "profit him nothing," unless it was accompanied by "charity," 
unless it "worked by love," which is "the fulfilling of the law;" the 
excellency of faith arising from the excellent end it answers in 
producing and nourishing love.  
</p><p>Should it be objected, that St. Paul says to the 
Galatians, "I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to 
God;" and to the Romans, "Ye are become dead to the law by the body of 
Christ:" I answer, in the apostle's days, that expression, <i>the law, </i>frequently
 meant "the whole Mosaic dispensation;" and in that sense every believer
 is dead to it, dead to all that Christ has not adopted. For, (1.) He is
 dead to the <i>Levitical law, </i>"Christ having abolished in himself the law of ordinances. Touch not, taste not, handle not." (2.) He is dead to the <i>ceremonial law, </i>which
 was only "a shadow of good things to come," a typical representation of
 Christ and the blessings flowing from his sacrifice. (3.) He is dead to
 the <i>curse </i>attending his past violations of the <i>moral law; </i>for "Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." And <i>lastly, </i>he is dead to the hopes of recommending himself to God by the <i>merit </i>of his obedience to the moral law; for in point of <i>merit, </i>he "is determined to know nothing but Christ and him crucified."  
</p><p>To make St. Paul mean more than this, is, (1.) To 
make him maintain that no believer can sin: for if "sin is the 
transgression of the law," and "the law is dead and buried," it is 
plain, no believer can sin, as nobody can transgress a law which is 
abolished: for "where no law is, there is no transgression." (2.) It is 
to make him contradict St. James, who exhorts us to "fulfil the royal 
law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself." And, (3.) It Is to make him contradict himself: for he charges
 the Galatians "by love to serve one another; all the law being 
fulfilled, in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself." And he assures the Hebrews, that under the new covenant, 
believers, far from being  
</p><p>without <i>God's </i>laws, have them written in their hearts; God <i>himself </i>placing
 them in their minds." We cannot, therefore, with any shadow of justice,
 put Dr. Crisp's coat upon the apostle, and press him into the service 
of Antinomians.  
</p><p>And did our Lord side with Antinomians? Just the 
reverse. Far from repealing the two above mentioned royal precepts, he 
asserts, that "on them hang all the law and the prophets;" and had the 
four Gospels been then written, he would no doubt have represented them 
as subservient to the establishing of the law, as he did the book of 
Isaiah, the evangelical prophet. Such high thoughts had he of the law, 
that when a lawyer expressed his veneration for it, by declaring that 
"the love of God, and our neighbour, was more than all whole burnt 
offerings and sacrifices, Jesus, seeing that he had answered discreetly,
 said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God."  
</p><p>The Gospel itself terminates in the fulfilling of 
the commandments. For as the curse of the law, like the scourge of a 
severe schoolmaster, drives, so the Gospel, like a loving, guide, brings
 us to Christ, the great Law Fulfiller, in whom we find inexhaustible 
treasures of pardon and power; of pardon for past breaches of the law, 
and of power for prevent obedience to it. Nor are we sooner come to him 
than he magnifies the law, by his precepts, as he formerly did by his 
obedience unto death. "If ye love me," says he, "keep my commandments." 
"This is his commandment, that we should love one another; and he that 
loveth another hath fulfilled the <i>law."</i>  
</p><p>Again: the Gospel displays Jesus' dying love, that by "believing" it <i>"we </i>may" love him, that is, "have everlasting life," the life of <i>love </i>which <i>abideth </i>when
 the life of faith is no more. Hence St. John sums up Christianity in 
these words, "We love him because he first loved us!" And what is it to 
love Jesus, but to fulfil the whole law at once, to love God and man, 
the Creator and the creature, united in one divinely human person!  
</p><p>Did the Son of God "magnify the law," that we 
might vilify it? Did he "make it honourable," that we might make it 
contemptible? Did he "come to fulfil it," that we might be discharged 
from fulfilling it according to our capacity? That is, discharged from 
loving God and our neighbour? Discharged from the employment and joys of
 heaven'? No: the "Word was <i>never </i>made flesh" for this dreadful 
end. None but Satan could have become incarnate to go upon such an 
infernal errand as this! Standing, therefore, upon the rock of 
evangelical truth, we ask, with St. Paul, "Do we then make void the law 
through faith? God forbid Nay, we establish the law." We point sinners 
to that Saviour in and from whom they may continually have the 
law-fulfilling power; "that the righteousness of the law may be 
fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit."  
</p><p>Such are the glorious and delightful views which 
the Scriptures give us of the law, disarmed of its curse in Christ; the 
law of holy, humble love, so strongly enforced in the discourses, and 
sweetly exemplified in the life and death of the "Prophet like unto 
Moses!" So amiable, so precious is the book of the law, when delivered 
to us by Jesus, sprinkled with his atoning blood, and explained by his 
loving Spirit! And so true is St. Paul's assertion, "We are not without 
law to God, but under the law to Christ!"  
</p><p>Instead then of dressing up the law as a 
scarecrow, let us in our degree "magnify it, and make it honourable," as
 did our Lord. Instead of representing it as "an intolerable yoke of 
bondage," let us call it, with St. Paul, "the law of Christ;" and, with 
St. James, "the perfect law of liberty." And let every true believer 
say, with David, "I love thy commandments above gold and precious 
stones: I shall alway keep thy law, yea, for ever and ever; I will walk 
at LIBERTY, for I seek thy precepts."  
</p><p>But, alas! how few give us these evangelical views
 of the law, and practical views of the Gospel! How many intimate Christ
 has "fulfilled all righteousness," that we might be the children of God
 with hearts "full of unrighteousness!" If some insist upon our 
"fulfilling all righteousness" also, is it not chiefly when they want to
 draw us into their peculiarities, and <i>dip </i>us into their narrow denomination? Arid what numbers, under the fair pretence that they "have a living law <i>written in their hearts," </i>insinuate,
 "there is no need of preaching the law" to them, either to show them 
more of God's purity, endear the atoning blood, regulate their conduct, 
or convince them of the necessity of <i>perfecting holiness!</i>  
</p><p>But suppose these objectors love, as they say, 
"the law written in their inward parts," (which the actions and tempers 
of some make rather doubtful,) is the writing so "perfectly finished," 
that no one stroke need to be added to it? Is not the law an important 
part of "the word of righteousness?" And could not the Holy Ghost 
retouch the writing, or deepen the engraving, by the ministry of "the 
word of righteousness?" Again: if the internal teachings of the Holy 
Spirit supersede the letter of the <i>law, </i>must they not, by the same reason, supersede the letter of the <i>Gospel? </i>Is
 there any more need of preaching the Gospel than the law to believers? 
Or have they not the Gospel "written in their hearts," as well as the 
law?  
</p><p>At what amazing heights of unscriptural perfection
 must our objectors suppose themselves to have arrived! What palpable 
errors do they run into, that they may have the honour of passing for 
evangelical! And who will envy them the glory of countenancing the 
Antinomian delusion, by standing in direct opposition to Christ, who 
thus decides the controversy: "Think not that I am come to destroy the 
law and the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfil. For verily
 I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or tittle 
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled," either in 
what it requires or denounces: for the law is "fulfilled" not only when 
its precepts are obeyed, but when rewards are given to the observers, 
and punishments inflicted upon the violators of it. "Whosoever, 
therefore, shall DO my commandments, and TEACH them, shall be great in 
the kingdom of heaven."  
</p><p>Do not imagine, Rev, sir, I thus cry up God's law to drown the late cries of <i>heresy </i>and <i>apostasy. </i>I
 appeal to matter of fact and your own observations. Consider the 
religious world, and say, if ANTINOMIANISM is not in general a motto 
better adapted to the state of professing congregations, societies, 
families, and individuals, than HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD, the inscription 
that should be even upon our "horses' bells."  
</p><p>II. Begin with CONGREGATIONS, and cast first your 
eyes upon the hearers. In general they have curious "itching ears, and 
will not endure sound doctrine." Many of them are armed with the 
"breastplate of a righteousness" which they have vainly* imputed to 
themselves: they have on the showy "helmet of a <i>presumptuous </i>hope,"
 and hold fast the impenetrable shield of strong prejudice. With these 
they "quench the fiery darts of" convincing truth, and stand undaunted 
under volleys of reproof.  
</p><p>* [Our imputation of Christ's righteousness to 
ourselves is a trick of our Antinomian hearts, and is a dreadful 
delusion: but God's imputing of Christ's righteousness to true believers
 is a most blessed reality, for which we cannot too much contend. "He 
speaks the word and it is done;" his imputation is not an <i>idea, </i>but
 a fiat; wherever it takes place, "Jehovah our righteousness, or Christ 
the righteous, dwells in the heart by faith." I wish that with respect 
to <i>imputed righteousness </i>we paid more regard to the late Mr. Hart's sentiment. This experienced and <i>sound </i>Calvinist,
 in the account of his conversion, prefixed to his Hymns, says, with 
great truth: "As much as Lazarus coming out of the grave, and feeling 
himself restored to life, differed from those who only saw the miracle, 
or believed the fact told them; so great is the difference between a 
soul's <i>real </i>coming to Christ out of himself and having the 
righteousness of Christ imputed to him by the precious faith of God's 
elect; and a man's bare believing the doctrine of imputed righteousness,
 because he sees it contained in the Scripture, or assenting to the 
truth of it when proposed to his understanding by others."]  
</p><p>They say, they "will have nothing but Christ." And
 who could blame them, if they would have Christ in all his offices? 
Christ, with all his parables and sermons, cautions and precepts, 
reproofs and expostulations, exhortations and threatenings? Christ, 
preaching to the multitudes upon a mountain, as well as honourably 
teaching in the temple? Christ, fasting in the wilderness, or praying in
 Gethsemane; as well as Christ making the multitude sit down upon the 
grass to receive "loaves and fishes," or promising "thrones" to his 
disciples? Christ, "constraining them to get into a ship, and toil in 
rowing all night with a contrary wind;" as well as Christ "coming in the
 morning," and causing "the ship to be immediately at the land whither 
they went?" Christ upon Mount Calvary, as well as Christ upon Mount 
Tabor? In a word, who would find fault with them if they would have 
Christ with his poverty and self denial, his reproach and cross, his 
Spirit and graces, his prophets and apostles, his plain apparel and mean
 followers?  
</p><p>But alas! it is not so. They will have <i>what </i>they please of Christ, and that too <i>as </i>they
 please. If he come accompanied by legal Moses and honest Elijah, who 
talk of the crucifixion of the body, and "decease" of the flesh, they 
can do very well without him. If he preach "free grace, free will, 
faithfulness, or heavenly mindedness," some turn to the right, some 
wheel about to the left, others go directly back, and all agree to say 
or think, "This is a hard saying, who can hear it?"  
</p><p>They admire him in one chapter, and know not what 
to make of him in another. Some of his words they extol to the sky, and 
others they seem to be ashamed of. If he assert his authority as a 
Lawgiver, they are ready to treat him with as little ceremony as they do
 Moses. If he say, "Keep my commandments: I am a king;" like the Jews of
 old, they rise against the awful declaration; or they "crown him" as a <i>Surety, </i>the better to "set him at naught" as <i>a Monarch. </i>And
 if he add, to his ministers, "I am the prophet that was to come'; go in
 my name, and teach all nations to observe all things whatsoever I have 
commanded you;" they complain, "This is <i>the law; </i>give us <i>the Gospel; </i>we can relish nothing but <i>the Gospel!</i>"  
</p><p>They have no idea of "eating the paschal lamb" 
whole, "his head with his legs, and the purtenance thereof;" nor do they
 take care of "not breaking his bones;" they do not like him roast with 
fire neither; but "raw or sodden with water" out of their own "broken 
cisterns." If you present him to them as the type of the "Lamb of God 
that taketh away the sin of the world, and maketh an end of it;" their 
hearts heave, they say, "Pray have me excused" from thus feeding upon 
him: and though it is said, "Ye shall let nothing of it remain until the
 morning, you shall eat it in haste," they postpone, they beg leave to 
keep it till the article of death: and if, in the meantime, you talk to 
them of "bitter herbs," they marvel at your Jewish, legal taste, and 
complain that you spoil the Gospel feast.  
</p><p>They do not consider we must "give every one his 
portion of meat," or proper medicine, "in due season;" and that sweet 
things are not always wholesome. They forget we must "leave all" 
Antinomian refinements "to follow Christ," who sometimes says to decent 
Pharisees, "How can you escape the damnation of hell?" And to a beloved 
disciple that shuns the cross, "Satan, thou savourest not the things of 
God, but the things of men." They will have nothing but the atonement. 
Nor do they choose to remember, that St. Paul, who "did not shun to 
declare the whole counsel of God," preached Christ to Felix, by 
"reasoning of temperance, righteousness, and judgment to come."  
</p><p>Hence it is that some preachers must choose 
comfortable subjects to please their hearers; just as those who make an 
entertainment for nice persons are obliged to study what will suit their
 difficult taste. A multitude of important scriptures may be produced, 
on which no minister, who is unwilling to lose his reputation as "an 
evangelical preacher," must dare to speak in some pulpits, unless it be 
to explain away or enervate their meaning. Take some instances  
</p><p>The good old Calvinists, (Archbishop Leighton for 
one,) questioned whether a man was truly converted who did not sincerely
 "go on to perfection," and heartily endeavour to "perfect holiness in 
the fear of God." But now, if we only quote such passages with an 
emphasis, and enforce their meaning with some degree of earnestness, the
 truth of our conversion is suspected: we even pass for enemies to 
Christ's righteousness.  
</p><p>If we have courage to handle such scriptures as 
these, "To do good and to distribute forget not, for with such 
sacrifices God is well pleased. Show me thy faith by thy works. Was not 
Rahab justified by works? By works was Abraham's faith made perfect," 
&amp;c, the bare giving out of our text prejudices our Antinomian 
hearers against us, and robs us of their candid attention, unless they 
expect a charity sermon; for on such an occasion they will yet allow us,
 at the close of our discourse, to speak honourably of good works: just 
as those who run to the opposite extreme, will yet, on some particular 
days, such as Christmas and Good Friday, permit us to make honourable 
mention of Jesus Christ.  
</p><p>The evil would be tolerable if we were only 
obliged to select smooth texts in order to gratify an Antinomian 
audience; but, alas! it is grown so desperate, that unless we 
"adulterate the sincere milk of the word," many reject it as poison. It 
is a doubt whether we could preach in some celebrated pulpits on "the 
good man, who is merciful and lendeth, who hath dispersed abroad and 
given to the poor, and whose righteousness remaineth for ever;" or on 
"breaking off our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by showing 
mercy to the poor;" or on "the righteousness which exceeds that of the 
scribes and Pharisees;" or on "the robes washed and made white in the 
blood of the Lamb," without giving general disgust; unless, to keep in 
the good grace of our Nicolaitan hearers, we were to dissent from all 
sober commentators, and offer the greatest violence to the context, our 
own conscience, and common sense, by saying, that <i>the righteousness </i>and <i>robes, </i>mentioned in those passages, are Christ's <i>imputed, and </i>not our <i>performed </i>obedience.  
</p><p>How few of our evangelical congregations would 
bear from the pulpit an honest explanation of what they allow us to read
 in the desk! We may open our service by saying, that "when the wicked 
man turneth away from his wickedness, and doth that which is lawful and 
right, he shall save his soul alive;" but wo to us, if we handle the 
Scripture in the pulpit, unless we wrest it by representing CHRIST as 
"the wicked man who DOES that which is lawful and right, to save our 
souls alive," without any of our <i>doings.</i>  
</p><p>Were we to preach upon these words of our Lord, 
"This DO and thou shalt live," Luke x, 25, the sense of which is fixed 
by the thirty-seventh verse, "Go and DO thou likewise;" or only to 
handle, without deceit, those common words of the Lord's prayer, 
confirmed by a plain parable, "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive 
them that trespass against us;" our reputation as Protestants would be 
in as much danger, from the bulk of some congregations, as our persons 
from the fire of a whole regiment in the day of battle. How would such a
 discourse, and the poor blind man that preached it, be privately 
exclaimed against; or publicly * exposed in a Magazine presented to the 
world under the sacred name of <i>Gospel!</i>  
</p><p>* [This was actually the case some months ago with respect to a sermon preached by Mr. Wesley.]  
</p><p>In short, whoever has courage enough to preach as 
St. Paul did at Athens, at Lystra, and before Felix, rebuking sin 
without respect of persons; whoever will imitate St. Peter, and exhort 
all his hearers to "save themselves from this perverse generation," 
assuring them that "the promise of the Holy Spirit is unto them, and 
their children;" must expect to be looked upon as unsound, if not as an 
enemy of free grace, and a setter forth of Pelagian or Popish doctrines.
 Moderate Calvinists themselves must run the gantlet, if they preach 
free grace as St. Peter did. A pious clergyman, noted for his strong 
attachment to what some call "the doctrines of grace," was, to my 
knowledge, highly blamed by one part of his auditory, for having 
preached to the other "repentance toward God," and exhorted them to call
 on him for mercy. And I remember he just saved his sinking reputation 
as a <i>sound </i>divine, by pleading, that two apostles exhorted even 
Simon Magus to "repent of his wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps 
the thought 0f his heart might be forgiven him."  
</p><p>When such professors will not bear the plainest 
truth, from ministers whose sentiments agree with theirs; how will they 
rise against deeper truths advanced by those who are of a different 
opinion! Some will even lose all decency. Observing, in preaching last 
summer, one of them remarkably busy in disturbing all around him, when 
the service was over I went up to him, and inquired into the cause of 
the dissatisfaction he had so indecently expressed. "I am not afraid to 
tell it to your face," said he; "I do not like your doctrine. You are a 
free willer." "If I have spoken evil," replied I, "bear witness of the 
evil." He paused awhile, and then charged me with praying before the 
sermon, as if ALL might be saved. "That is false doctrine," added he, 
"and if Christ himself came down from heaven to preach it, I would not 
believe him."  
</p><p>I wondered at first at tile positiveness of my 
rigid objector: hut, upon second thoughts, I thought him modest, in 
comparison of numbers of professors, who see that Christ actually came 
down from heaven, and preached the doctrine of perfection in his sermon 
upon the mount, and yet will face us down that it is an antichristian 
doctrine.  
</p><p>This Antinomian cavilling of hearers against 
preachers is deplorable; and the effects of it will be dreadful. If the 
Lord do not put a stop to this growing evil, we shall soon see every 
where, what we see in too many places, self-conceited, unhumbled men, 
rising against the truths and ministers of God; men who "are not <i>meek </i>doers of the law," but <i>insolent </i>judges,
 preposterously trying that law by which they shall soon be tried;--men 
who, instead of sitting as criminals before all the messengers of their 
Judge, with arrogancy invade the Judge's tribunal, and arraign even his 
most venerable ambassadors;--men, who should "fall on their faces before
 all, and give glory to God, by confessing that he is with his 
ministers," of every denomination, "of a truth;" but who, far from doing
 it, boldly condemn the word that condemns them, snatch the two-edged 
sword from the mouth of every faithful messenger, blunt the edge of it, 
and audaciously thrust at him in their turn;--men, who, when they see a 
servant of God in their pulpit, suppose he stands at their bar; try him 
with as much insolence as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram tried Moses; cast 
him with less kindness than Pilate did Jesus; force a fool's coat of 
their own making upon him; and then, from "the seat of the scornful," 
pronounce the decisive sentence: "He is legal, dark, blind, unconverted;
 an enemy to free grace. He is a rank Papist, a Jesuit, a false prophet,
 or a wolf in sheep's clothing."  
</p><p>III. But whence springs this almost general 
Antinomianism of our congregations? Shall I conceal the sore because it 
festers in my own breast? Shall I be partial? No, in the name of Him who
 is "no respecter of persons," I will confess my sin, and that of many 
of my brethren. Though I am the least, and (I write it with tears of 
shame) the most unworthy of them all, I will follow the dictates of my 
conscience, and use the authority of a minister of Christ. If Balaam, a <i>false </i>prophet, took in good part the reproof of his ass, I should wrong my honoured brethren and fathers, the <i>true </i>prophets
 of the Lord, if I feared their resenting some well-meant reproofs, 
which I first level at myself, and for which I heartily wish there was 
no occasion.  
</p><p>Is hot the Antinomianism of hearers fomented by 
that of preachers? Does it not become us to take the greatest part of 
the blame upon ourselves, according to the old adage, "Like priest, like
 people?" Is it surprising that some of us should have an Antinomian 
audience? Do we not make or keep it so? When did we preach such a 
practical Sermon as that of our Lord on the mount, or write such close 
letters as the epistles of St. John? Alas! I doubt it is but seldom. Not
 living so near to God ourselves as we should, we are afraid to come 
near to the consciences of our people. The Jews said to our Lord, "In so
 saying thou reproachest us;" but now the case is altered, and our 
auditors might say to many of us, "In so saying you would reproach 
yourselves."  
</p><p>Some prefer popularity to plain dealing. We love 
to see a crowd of worldly-minded hearers, rather than "a little flock, a
 peculiar people zealous of good works." We dare not shake our 
congregations to purpose, lest our five <i>thousand </i>should, in three years' time, be reduced to <i>a hundred and twenty.</i>  
</p><p>Luther's advice to Melancthon, <i>Scandaliza fortiter, </i>"So
 preach that those who do not fall out with their sins may fall out with
 thee," is more and more unfashionable. Under pretence of drawing our 
hearers by love, some of us softly rock the cradle of carnal security in
 which they sleep. For "fear of grieving the dear children of God," we 
let "buyers and sellers, sheep and oxen," yea, goats and lions, fill 
"the temple" undisturbed. And because "the bread must not be kept from 
the hungry children," we let those who are wanton make shameful waste of
 it, and even allow "dogs," which we should "beware of," and noisy 
parrots that can speak <i>shibboleth, </i>to do the same. We forget that
 God's children "are led by his Spirit," who is "the Comforter" himself;
 that they are all afraid of being deceived, all "jealous for the Lord 
of hosts;" and therefore prefer a preacher who "searches Jerusalem with 
candles," and cannot suffer God's house to be made a "den of thieves," 
to a workman who "whitewashes <i>the noisome </i>sepulchres," he should open, and "daubs over with untempered mortar the <i>bulging </i>walls" he should demolish.  
</p><p>The old Puritans strongly insisted upon <i>personal holiness, </i>and the first Methodists upon the <i>new birth; </i>but
 these doctrines seem to grow out of date. The Gospel is cast into 
another mould. People, it seems, may now be "in Christ," without being 
"new creatures," and "new creatures" without casting "old things" away. 
They may be God's children without God's image; and "born of the Spirit"
 without "the fruits of the Spirit." If our unregenerate hearers get 
orthodox ideas about the way of salvation in their heads, evangelic 
phrases concerning Jesus' love in their mouths, and a warm zeal for our 
party and favourite forms in their hearts; without any more ado, we help
 them to rank themselves among the children of God. But, alas! this self
 adoption into the family of Christ will no more pass in heaven than 
self imputation of Christ's righteousness. The work of the Spirit will 
stand there, and that alone. Again:  
</p><p>Some of us often give our congregations particular accounts of <i>the covenant </i>between
 the persons of the blessed Trinity, and speak of it as confidently as 
if the King of kings had admitted us members of his privy council; but 
how seldom do we do justice to the Scriptures, where the covenant is 
mentioned in a <i>practical </i>manner! How rarely do the ministers, who
 are fond of preaching upon the covenant between God and David, dwell 
upon such scriptures as these! "Because they continued not in my 
covenant, I regarded them not; because they have transgressed the law, 
changed the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant, therefore 
bath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are 
desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men
 left. I say to the wicked, What hast thou to do to take my covenant in 
thy mouth. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
 law;" they would not be evangelically legal, "therefore a fire was 
kindled in Jacob, the wrath of God came upon them, he slew the fattest 
of them, and smote down the chosen, <i>the elect </i>of Israel!"  
</p><p>We frequently keep back from our hearers the very 
portions that honest Nathan or blunt John the Baptist would have 
particularly enforced. The taste of many is perverted; they "loathe the 
manna of the word," not because it is <i>light, </i>but <i>heavy </i>food. They must have "savoury meat, such as their soul loveth;" and we <i>"hunt </i>for
 venison," we minister to their spiritual luxury, and feast with them on
 our doctrinal refinements. Hence "many are weak and sickly among us." 
Some that might be "fat and well-liking, cry out, <i>My leanness! .My leanness!</i>" And "many sleep" in a spiritual grave, the easy prey of corruption and sin.  
</p><p>How few Calebs, how few Joshuas are found among 
the many spies who bring a report of the good land! The cry is seldom, 
"Let us go up and possess it," unless the good land be the map of the 
Gospel drawn by Dr. Crisp. On the contrary, the difficulties attending 
the noble conquest are magnified to the highest degree. "The sons of 
Anak are tall and strong, and their cities are fenced up to heaven" All 
our corruptions are gigantic. The castle where they dwell shall always 
remain a den of thieves. It is an impregnable citadel, strongly 
garrisoned by Apollyon's forces: we shall never love God here with all 
our souls: we shall always have desperately wicked hearts."  
</p><p>How few of our celebrated pulpits are there, where more has not been said at <i>times </i>for
 sin than against it! With what an air of positiveness and assurance has
 that Barabbas, that murderer of Christ and souls, been pleaded for! "It
 will humble us, make us watchful, stir up our diligence, quicken our 
graces, endear Christ," &amp;c. That is, in plain English, pride will 
beget humility; sloth will spur us on to diligence; rust will brighten 
our armour; and unbelief, the very soul of every sinful temper, is to do
 the work of faith! Sin must not only be always lurking about the walls 
and gates of the town of Man's Soul, (if I may once more allude to 
Bunyan's <i>Holy War,) </i>but it shall dwell in it, in the King's 
palace, "in the inner chamber," the inmost recesses of the heart; there 
is no turning it out. Jesus, who cleansed the lepers with a word or a 
touch, cannot, with all the force of his Spirit and virtue of his blood,
 expel this leprosy. It is too inveterate. Death, that foul monster, the
 offspring of sin, shall have the important honour of killing his 
father. He, he alone is to give the great, the last, the decisive blow. 
This is confidently asserted by those who cry, <i>Nothing but Christ! </i>They
 allow him to lop off the branches; but death, the great saviour death, 
is to destroy the root of sin. In the meantime "the temple of God shall 
have agreement with idols, and Christ concord with Belial: the Lamb" of 
God shall "lie down with the roaring lion" in our hearts.  
</p><p>Nor does the preaching of this internal slavery, 
this bondage of spiritual corruption, shock our hearers. No: this 
mixture of light and darkness passes for Gospel in our days. And what is
 more astonishing still, by making much ado about "finished salvation," 
we can even put it off as "the only pure, genuine, and comfortable 
Gospel:" while the smoothness of our doctrine will atone for our most 
glaring inconsistencies.  
</p><p>We have so whetted the Antinomian appetite of our 
hearers, that they swallow down almost any thing. We may tell them St. 
Paul was, at one and the same time, "carnal, sold under sin," crying, 
"Who shall deliver me from this body of death '?" and triumphing that he
 did "not walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit, rejoicing in the 
testimony of a good conscience," and glorying that "the law of the 
Spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made him free from the law of sin and
 death!" This suits their experience; therefore they readily take our 
word, and it passes for "the word of God." It is a mercy that we have 
not yet attempted to prove, by the same argument, that lying and cursing
 are quite consistent with apostolic faith; for St. Paul speaks of his 
"lie," and St. James says, "With our tongues curse we men."  
</p><p>We may make them believe, that though adultery and
 murder are damning sins in poor blind Turks and heathens, yet they are 
only the spots of God's children in enlightened Jews and favoured 
Christians: that God is the most partial of all judges; some being 
accursed to the pit of hell for breaking the law in the most trifling 
points; while others, who actually break it in the most flagrant 
instances, are richly "blessed with all heavenly benedictions:" and 
that, while God beholds "no iniquity in Jacob, no perverseness in 
Israel," he sees nothing but odious sins in Israel, and devilish 
wickedness in Esau; although the Lord assures us, "Time wickedness of 
the wicked shall be upon him," and that "though hand join in hand the 
wicked shall not go unpunished," were he as great in Jacob as Korah, and
 as famous as Zimri in Israel.  
</p><p>We may tell our hearers, one hour, that "the love of Christ <i>sweetly </i>constrains"
 all believers to walk, yea, to "run the way of God's commandments," and
 that they cannot help obeying its forcible dictates:  
</p><p>and we may persuade them, the next hour, that "how
 to perform what is good they find not; that they fall continually into 
sin; for that which they do they allow not, and what they would, that do
 they not; but what they hate, that do they." And that these 
inconsistencies may not shock their common sense, or alarm their 
consciences, we again touch the sweet-sounding string of "finished 
salvation:" we intimate we have the key of evangelical knowledge, 
reflect on those who' expect deliverance from sin in this life, and 
"build up" our congregations in a most comfortable, I wish I could say, 
"most holy faith."  
</p><p>In short, we have so used our people to strange 
doctrines, and preposterous assertions, that, if we were to intimate, 
God himself sets us a pattern of Antinomianism, by disregarding his own 
most holy and lovely law, which inculcates perfect love,--if we were 
even to hint that he bears a secret grudge, or an immortal enmity to 
those very souls whom he commands us to "love as Christ has loved us;" 
that he feeds them only for the great day of slaughter, and has 
determined, (so inveterate is his hatred!) "before the foundation of the
 world" to "fit" them as "vessels of wrath," that he might eternally 
fill them with his fiery vengeance, merely to show what a great and 
sovereign God he is; I doubt whether some would not be highly pleased, 
and say we had "preached a sound and sweet discourse." This would 
probably he the case, if we addressed them in such a manner as to make 
them believe they are <i>elect; </i>not, indeed, of those ancient, 
legal, and wrestling "elect, who cry to God day and night to be avenged 
of their spiritual adversary," but of those modern, indolent elect, who 
have found out a short way to heaven, and maintain, "We are absolutely 
to do nothing in order to salvation."  
</p><p>With joy I confess, however, that glorious and 
rousing truths are frequently delivered in the demonstration of the 
Spirit and of power. But, alas! the blow is seldom followed. You have 
seen fond mothers violently correcting their children one instant, and 
the next dandling them upon their knees; and, by foolishly kissing away 
their tears, spoiling the correction they had given. Just so it is with 
several of us:  
</p><p>we preach a close discourse, and seem determined 
to drive the buyers and sellers out of the temple. Our Antinomian 
hearers begin to awake and look about them: some are even ready to cry 
out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do'!" but, alas! we sound a 
retreat when we should shout for a second battle. By an unaccountable 
weakness, before we conclude, we soothe them up, and make a way for 
their escape; or, which is not much better, the next time we preach, by 
setting up Dr. Crisp's doctrine as much as ever, we industriously repair
 the breach we had made in the Antinomian Babel.  
</p><p>And suppose some of us preach against 
Antinomianism, is not our practice contrary to our preaching'! We are 
under a dangerous mistake if we think ourselves clear from Antinomianism
 merely because we thunder against Antinomian principles: for as some, 
who zealously maintain such principles, by the happiest inconsistency in
 the world, pay nevertheless, in their practice, a proper regard to the 
law they revile; so not a few, who profess the deepest respect for it, 
are so unhappily inconsistent as to transgress it without ceremony. The 
God of holiness says, "Go and WORK in my vineyard;" the inconsistent 
Antinomian answers, "I will not be bound by any law; I scorn the ties of
 duty:" but nevertheless "he repents and goes." The inconsistent 
legalist replies, "It is my bounden duty to obey; <i>I go, Lord:</i>" 
nevertheless "lie does not go." Which of the two is the greater 
Antinomian'! The latter, no doubt: his practical Antinomianism is much 
more odious to God and man than the speculative error of the former.  
</p><p>The Lord God help us to avoid both! Whether the 
hellish wolf comes barefaced, or "in sheep's clothing;" or, what is a 
still more dangerous disguise, in <i>Lamb's </i>clothing; in the clothes
 of the Shepherd, covered from head to foot with a righteousness which 
he has "imputed" to himself, and sings the siren song of "finished 
salvation."  
</p><p>IV<i>. </i>I shall close these reflections upon 
the Antinomianism of preachers, by presenting you with sketches of two 
very opposite ways of preaching. The first is an extract from Bishop 
Hopkins' twenty-fourth sermon, entitled, <i>Practical Christianity, </i>upon
 those words of St. Paul, "Work out your own salvation with fear and 
trembling," &amp;c. This testimony will weigh so much the more with you,
 as he was a <i>sound Calvinist, </i>and a truly converted man.  
</p><p>"To work out our salvation," says the godly 
prelate, "is to persevere in the ways of obedience until, through them, 
that salvation which is begun here on earth be perfected in heaven. This
 work implies three things: (1.) Pains and labour. Salvation is that 
which must be wrought out; it is that which will make the soul pant and 
breathe, yea, run down with sweat to obtain it. (2.) It implies 
constancy and diligence. A Christian that would 'work out his salvation'
 must be always employed about it. It is a web, into which we must weave
 the whole thread of our lives. That man who works at salvation only by 
some passionate fits, and then, within awhile, undoes it all again by 
foul apostasy and notorious sins, will never work salvation <i>out. </i>(3.)
 It promises success; though it be hard work, it shall not be long work;
 continue working, it shall be wrought out; what before was your work, 
shall be your reward; and this salvation, that was so painful in 
working, shall be most blessed in the enjoyment.  
</p><p>"Say not, 'We have no strength to work with.' What
 God commands us to do he will assist us in doing. We are impotent, but 
God is omnipotent. Work, therefore; for this omnipotent God 'works in 
you both to will and to do.'  
</p><p>"The proposition I shall lay down from the text is
 this: 'That it is the duty of every true Christian to work out his own 
salvation with fear and trembling:' or, 'that every Christian, yea, 
every man, ought to work for his living, even for an eternal life.' To 
mention places for the proof of this, were to transcribe the Bible. We 
can no where open this blessed book but we find this truth proves to us,
 either directly or by consequence. And yet, it is strange in these days
 to see how dubiously some men, who would be thought admirers of free 
grace, speak of obedience and working, as if they were the badge of a 
legal spirit. O, it is a soft and easy doctrine to bid men sit still and
 believe, as if God would translate them to heaven upon their couches! 
Is it possible that these notions should be dispersed and entertained, 
but because it has always been the devil's policy to vent those 
doctrines that indulge the flesh under the patronage of <i>free grace and Gospel attainments?</i>  
</p><p>"Wherefore is it that we are commanded to 'strive 
that we may enter in at the strait gate'! So to run that we may 
obtain'!' So to <i>wrestle </i>that we may be 'able to stand'!' So 'to 
fight, that we may lay hold on eternal life'!' Can you strive and run, 
and wrestle and fight, and all this by doing nothing'! If God would save
 you without working, why has he given you grace, an operative 
principle, that you might work He might as well save you without grace 
as without works: for that is not grace that does not put forth itself 
in working. God, rather than we shall not work, will set us at work. He 
gives and promises assistance, only that we might work out our own 
salvation. 'We are not sufficient to think any thing:' What then'! Must 
we therefore sit still'! 'No,' says the apostle: for God, who finds us 
employment will also find us strength. <i>'Our sufficiency is of God.'</i>  
</p><p>"Wherefore is it that men are justly damned'! Is 
it not because they will not do what they are able to do'! And whence 
have they this ability'! Is it not from the grace of God's Spirit'! What
 is it that men expect'! Must God drive them to heaven by force and 
violence, whether they will or not'!  
</p><p>"If man will, he may work out his salvation. I 
speak not this to assert the power of man to work out salvation without 
the aid of special grace to incline his will. Where there is special 
grace given to make the will willing to convert, there is nothing more 
required to make him able, because conversion chiefly consists in the 
act of the will itself; only to make him willing is required special 
grace; which they, that favour the undue liberty of the will, deny. Our 
impotency lies in the stubbornness of our wills. The greatest sinner may
 work out his own salvation if he will. If he be but willing, he has 
that already that may make him able. God puts no new powers in the soul 
when he converts it.  
</p><p>"Are there any so desperately profane as not to 
have prayed unto God in their whole life'! Why now, to what end have you
 prayed 1 Was it not for salvation? And did you work for salvation, and 
at the same time believe you could not work'! Thou art inexcusable, O 
man, whoever thou art, that wilt not work-: it is in vain to plead thou 
wantest power! God will confute thee out of thy own mouth.  
</p><p>"Would a master, when he commands his servant to 
work, take this as a sufficient excuse for his sloth and idleness, that 
he has no power to work till God acts and moves him? Why, this is a 
truth, and it may as well be objected by your servants to you, as by you
 unto God. Though it is impossible that men should stir without God's 
concurrence, yet this hinders not endeavour, no, nor is it any matter of
 discouragement to them. They put these things to the trial. Now, why 
should we not do so in spirituals as well as in temporals? Are they not 
of greater concernment'! It is not inability, but wilful sloth, that 
destroys men. Sinners, wherefore will you perish? Why will you sleep 
away your souls into hell? Is it more painful for you to work than to be
 damned? Endeavour therefore to do what you can: labour and sweat at 
salvation's work, rather than fail of it for a wilful neglect 'How shall
 you escape if you neglect so great salvation?'  
</p><p>"OBJECTION. Thus to press men to working is 
derogatory to Christ's merits, by which alone we are saved, and not by 
our works. Christ has done all for us, and wrought out our salvation by 
himself. Shall we piece out his work by our obedience, when all we have 
now to do is to believe on him?"  
</p><p>"ANSWER. There is the sweetest harmony between the
 merits of Christ and our 'working out of our salvation.' To make it 
evident,, I shall show what Christ has done for us, and what he expects 
we should do for ourselves. He has merited grace, and purchased eternal 
happiness. And why did Christ merit grace'! Was it not that we-might act
 it in obedience'! If he merited grace that we might obey, is-it sense 
to object, that our 'obedience is derogatory to his merit? If one end of
 his doing all that he did for us was to enable us to do for ourselves, 
will any maim say, 'Now I am bound to do nothing, because Christ has 
done all'!' How lost are such men both to reason and religion, who 
undertake so to argue! No: salvation was purchased and grace procured, 
that, by the acting and exercise of that grace, we might attain to that 
salvation. It is not by way of merit or purchase that we exhort men to 
work out their salvation. Those are guilty of practical blasphemy 
against the priestly office of Christ who think to merit it by their own
 works.  
</p><p>"As Christ has done two things for us, so he 
requires two things from us. (1.) That we should put forth all the 
strength of nature in labouring after grace: and (2.) That we should put
 forth the power of grace in labouring for the salvation purchased for 
us. (1.) Let every sinner know it is his work to repent and return, that
 he may live. You cannot sit down and say, 'What need is there of my 
working? Christ has already done all my work for me to my hands.' No: Christ has done his own work, the work of a <i>Saviour </i>and a <i>Surety; </i>but he never did the work of a <i>sinner.</i>  
</p><p>"If Christ, by <i>meriting </i>grace, had bestowed
 it upon thee, and wrought it in thee, then indeed no more would be 
required of thee to become holy, but to cast back a lazy look at the 
purchase of Jesus Christ: then thy sloth would have some pretence not to
 labour. But this will not do. Our Saviour commands all men 'to seek 
first the kingdom of God:' and the apostle exhorts Simon Magus 'to 
pray.' Do not therefore cheat your own souls into perdition by lazy 
notions about Christ's merits. If you sit still, expecting till the 
meriting grace of Christ drop down into your souls, and change your 
hearts, truly, it may be, before that time you yourselves may drop down 
into hell, with your old unchanged hearts!  
</p><p>"(2.)<i> </i>Christ expects that those who have 
grace should put forth the utmost power thereof in labouring after the 
salvation he has purchased for them. He has merited salvation for them; 
but it is to be obtained by their own labour and industry. Is not what 
Christ has done sufficient? Must he <i>repent, believe, </i>and <i>obey </i>for
 them? This is not to make him a Saviour, but a drudge. He has done what
 was fit for a Mediator to do. He now requires of us what is meet for <i>sinners </i>to
 do; that is, to repent, &amp;c. He now bids you 'wash and be clean.' 
Would you have the great Prophet come and strike off your leprosy, and 
you do nothing toward the cure? The way to heaven is made possible; but 
if you do not walk in the way that leads to it, you may still be as far 
from heaven as ever. Though Christ's bearing the punishment of the law 
by death does exempt us from suffering, yet his obeying of the law does 
not excuse our obedience to the law. Nor is our obedience derogatory to 
Christ's, because it proceeds from other grounds than Christ's did. He 
obeyed the jaw as a covenant of works,--we only as a rule of 
righteousness.  
</p><p>"To conclude upon this point: so work with that 
earnestness, constancy, and unweariedness in well doing, as if thy works
 alone were able to justify and save thee: and so absolutely depend and 
rely upon the merits of Christ for justification and salvation, as if 
thou never hadst performed one act of obedience in all thy life. This is
 the right Gospel frame of obedience, so to work, as if we were only to 
be saved by our own merits; and withal so to rest on the merits of 
Christ, as if we had never wrought any thing. It is a difficult thing to
 give to each of these its due in our practice. When we work, we are too
 apt to neglect Christ; and when we rely on Christ, we are too apt to 
neglect working. But that Christian has got the right art of obedience 
who can mingle these two together; who can with one hand 'work the works
 of God,' and yet, at the same time, lay fast hold on the merits of 
Jesus Christ. Let this Antinomian principle be for ever rooted out of 
the minds of men, that our working is derogatory to Christ's work. Never
 more think he has done all your work for you, but labour for that 
salvation which he has purchased and merited. Could ever such senseless 
objections prevail with men who have seriously read this scripture? 'He 
gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and 
purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. But truly, 
when sloth and ignorance meet together if you tell men what powers their
 natures, assisted by preventing grace, have to work, and how necessary 
obedience is to salvation, they, with the sluggard, fold their arms in 
their bosom, doing nothing; telling us these doctrines are <i>Arminianism </i>and flat <i>Popery. </i>But
 deceive not yourselves: whether this doctrine takes hold on your 
judgments now, I know not; but this I know assuredly, it shall take hold
 on your consciences either here or hereafter; and then it will not 
suffice you to say, either that you had no power to do any thing, or 
that Christ has already done all for you."  
</p><p>This excellent discourse should be in all the 
houses of professors. It would shame the careless remonstrants, and show
 them how orthodox some Calvinists are in point of works; and it would 
confound the slothful Calvinists, and make them see how they have left <i>practical Christianity </i>for <i>Antinomian Christianity. </i>For
 east cannot be farther from west than the preceding extract of Bishop 
Hopkins' sermon is from the following propositions, extracted from Dr. 
Crisp's Works, which some make the standard of evangelical preaching. 
They are refuted also in "Gospel Truth Vindicated, by Mr. Williams," 
whose excellent refutation is recommended by fifty-three Calvinist 
divines of the last century. And Mr. Wesley's propositions, in the 
Minutes of the conference held in 1770, may be looked upon as the ground
 on which that refutation stands.  
</p><p>"Must not a believer, an elect, be reckoned to be a
 sinner while he does sin? No: though he does sin, yet he is not to be 
reckoned as a sinner; his sins are reckoned to be taken away from him. A
 man does sin against God; God reckons not his sin to be his; he reckons
 it Christ's, therefore he cannot reckon it to be his. There is no 
condition in the covenant of grace; man has no tie upon him to perform 
any thing whatsoever as a condition that must be observed on his part; 
and there is not one bond or obligation upon man to the fulfilling of 
his part of the covenant, or partaking of the benefits of it. There is 
no better way to know your portion in Christ, than, upon the general 
tender of the Gospel, to conclude absolutely he is yours: say, 'My part 
is as good as any man's:' set down thy rest here; question it not, but 
believe it. Christ belongs to sinners as sinners; and if there be no 
worse than sinfulness, rebellion, and enmity in thee, he belongs to 
thee, as well as to any in the world. Christ does justify a person 
before he believes; we do not believe that we may be justified, but 
because we are justified. The elect are justified from eternity, at 
Christ's death; and the latest time is before they are born. It is a 
received conceit among persons that our obedience is the way to heaven; 
and though it be not, say they, the cause of our reign, yet it is the 
way to the kingdom: but I must tell you, all this sanctification of life
 is not a jot the way of that justified person to heaven. To what 
Purpose do we propose to ourselves the gaining of that by our labour and
 industry that is already become ours before we do one jot? Must they 
now labour to gain these things, as if it were referred to their well or
 evil walking, that as they shall walk so they shall speed? The Lord 
does nothing in his people upon conditions. The Lord intends not that by
 our obedience we shall gain something, which, in case of our failing, 
we shall miscarry of. While you labour to get by duties, you provoke God
 as much as in you lies. We must work from life, and not for life. There
 is nothing you can do from whence you ought to expect any gain to 
yourselves. Love to the brethren, universal obedience, and all Other 
inherent qualifications, are no signs by which we should judge of our 
state. Every elect vessel, from the first instant of his being, is as 
pure in the eyes of God from the charge of sin as he shall be in glory. 
Though such persons do act rebellion, yet the loathsomeness and 
hatefulness of this rebellion is laid on the back of Christ; he bears 
the sin, as well as the blame and shame: and God can dwell with persons 
that act the thing, because all the filthiness of it is translated from 
them upon the back of Christ. It is the voice of a lying spirit in your 
hearts, that says, 'You that are believers (as David) have yet sin 
wasting your conscience.' David indeed says, <i>My sins are gone over my head, </i>but
 he speaks from himself, and all that he speaks from himself was not 
truth. There is as much ground to be confident of the pardon of sin to a
 believer, as soon as he committed it, as to believe it after he has 
performed all the humiliation in the world. A believer may be assured of
 pardon as soon as he Commits any sin, even adultery and murder. There 
is not one fit of sadness in a believer, but he is out of the way of 
Christ. God does no longer stand displeased though a believer do sin 
often. There is no sin that ever believers commit that can possibly do 
them any hurt. Therefore, as their sins cannot hurt them, so there is no
 cause of fear in their sins committed. Sins are but scarecrows and 
bugbears to fright ignorant children, but men of understanding see they 
are counterfeit things. Sin is dead, and there is no more terror in it 
than in a dead lion. If we tell believers, except they walk thus and 
thus holily, and do these and those good works, God will be angry with 
them, we abuse the Scriptures, undo what Christ has done, injure 
believers, and tell God lies to his face. All our righteousness is 
filthy, full of menstruosity, the highest kind of filthiness:--even what
 is the Spirit's must be involved within that which is a man's own, 
under the general notion of <i>dung. </i>God has done every thing in 
Christ, and taken away all things that can disturb our peace; but man 
will be mincing the truth, and tell you, that if you keep close to God, 
and refrain from sin, God will love you. Christ does all his work for 
him as well as in him that believes. If persons are not united to 
Christ, and do not partake of justification before they do believe, 
there will be bringing to life again the covenant of works; you must of 
necessity press upon yourselves these terms, 'I must do, that I may have
 life in Christ; I must believe.' Now if there be believing first, then 
there is doing before living. To what purpose do we tell men of wrath 
and damnation? We had as good hold our tongues," &amp;e, &amp;c.  
</p><p>"I observe," says my judicious Calvinist author, "the pretence for these opinions is, <i>that they exalt </i>CHRIST <i>and </i>FREE
 GRACE. Under this shadow Antinomianism set up in Germany. This was the 
great cry in England above fifty years since. The Synod of New-England 
expose this as one of the speeches of them whom they call Antinomians: 
'Here is a great stir about grace and looking to hearts; but give me 
Christ! I seek not for graces, but for Christ: I seek not for promises, 
but for Christ: I seek not for sanctification, but for Christ: tell
 me not of meditation and duties, but tell me of Christ.' Dr. Crisp very
 often bears upon this point, as if all he said was to advance Christ 
and grace."  
</p><p>You will perhaps say that our Gospel ministers are
 far more guarded than the doctor. But I would ask whether all his 
scheme is not collected and made to centre in the one fashionable 
expression of <i>finished salvation? </i>which seems to be our <i>Shibboleth.</i>  
</p><p>If the <i>salvation </i>of the elect was <i>finished </i>upon the cross, then was their <i>justification </i>finished, their <i>sanctification </i>finished, their <i>glorification </i>finished. For justification, sanctification, and glorification finished, are hut the various parts of our <i>finished salvation. </i>If our justification be <i>finished, </i>there is no need of believing in order to be justified. If our sanctification be <i>finished, </i>there
 is no need of mortifying one sin, praying for one grace, taking up one 
cross, parting with either right eye or right hand, in order to perfect 
holiness. Again:  
</p><p>Suppose our salvation be <i>finished, </i>it 
follows, Christ has done all, and we are to do nothing. Obedience and 
good works are no more necessary in order to it, than cutting and 
carrying stones are necessary to the completing of Westminster bridge. 
We are as perfect in Christ, as completely blameless and holy in the 
midst of all our sins, as ever we shall be in glory. In a word, if 
salvation be <i>finished, </i>well ordered in all things and sure, our 
sins cannot take any thing from it, nor our righteousness have any thing
 to do with it. The little flock of the elect shall be saved, nay, are 
fully saved now, do what they please; and the multitudes of the 
reprobates shall be damned, do what they can. Give me only the smooth 
ring of <i>finished salvation, </i>and without offering the least violence to common sense, I shall necessarily draw every link of Dr. Crisp's Antinomian chain.  
</p><p>I have often wondered how so many excellent men 
can be so fond of an expression which is the stalking horse of every 
wild ranter. Is it Scriptural? Which of the prophets or apostles ever 
used it on earth? Do even "the spirits of just men made perfect," 
ascribe <i>finished salvation </i>to the Lamb? If they did, would not 
their uncollected dust, and the souls "crying under the altar," prove 
their praises premature? Will salvation be <i>finished </i>till "the last enemy, death," is fully overcome by the general resurrection? Again:  
</p><p>Is the expression <i>of finished salvation </i>consistent
 with the analogy of faith? Does it not supersede our Lord's 
"intercession at the right hand of God?" Whether he intercede for the 
reprobate or the elect, acts he not a most unwise part? Is he not giving
 himself a needless trouble, whether he intercede for the justification 
of those whom he has himself <i>reprobated, </i>or for the salvation of those whose salvation is <i>finished? </i>Is
 it right to offer an insult to our High Priest upon his mediatorial 
throne, under pretence of honouring him on the cross? And may not I say,
 with judicious Baxter, "See what this overdoing tends to!" See what 
contempt it pours upon Him "who is the brightness of his Father's 
glory!"  
</p><p>If that favourite expression be neither Scriptural nor agreeable to the analogy of faith, is it at least <i>rational? </i>I doubt it is not. <i>Finished salvation </i>implies
 both a deliverance from bodily and spiritual evils, and a being made 
fully partakers of heavenly glory, in body and in soul. But waiving the 
consideration of glory and heaven, and taking the word <i>salvation </i>in its negative and lower sense, I ask, Can it be said, with any propriety, that bodily salvation is <i>finished, </i>while
 innumerable pains and diseases surround us, to drag us to the grave, 
and deliver us to putrefaction? And is spiritual salvation <i>finished? </i>"Is
 the body of sin destroyed?" Do not those very ministers, who preach 
finished salvation with one breath, tell us with the next, "There is no 
deliverance, (that is, <i>no finished salvation,) </i>from sin in this life?"  
</p><p>And what end does that expression answer? I know 
of none but that of spreading Dr. Crisp's doctrine, and making thousands
 of deluded souls talk as if the "tower" of their salvation was 
finished, when they have not so much as "counted the cost;" or when they
 have just laid the foundation.  
</p><p>Therefore, with all due deference to my brethren and fathers who preach <i>finished salvation, </i>I ask, Would it not be better to drop that doctrine, with all the other dangerous refinements of Dr. Crisp,, and preach a <i>finished atonement, a present sovereign remedy, completely prepared </i>to
 heal all our spiritual infirmities, assuage all our miseries, and fit 
us for finished salvation in glory? Would not this be as well at least, 
as to help our patients to compose themselves to sleep upon 'the pillow 
of Antinomianism; by making them believe that the preparation of the 
remedy, and a complete cure, are all one; so that now they have 
absolutely nothing to do in order to saving health, and (as the apostles
 concluded about Lazarus,) "if they sleep they shall do well?" And 
should we not, even in speaking of <i>redemption, </i>imitate the judicious Calvinists of the last century, who carefully distinguished between redemption by the <i>price </i>of Jesus' blood, and redemption by the <i>power </i>of
 his Spirit? "The former," said they, "was finished upon the cross but 
the latter is not so much as begun in thousands; even in all that are 
unborn or unconverted."  
</p><p>V. To speak the melancholy truth, how few 
individuals are free from practical Antinomianism! Setting aside their 
attendance on the ministry of the word, where is the material difference
 between several of our genteel believers and other people? Do we not 
see the sumptuous furniture in their apartments, and fashionable 
elegance in their dress? What sums of money do they frequently lay out 
in costly superfluities to adorn their persons, houses, and gardens!  
</p><p>Wise heathens, by the help of a little philosophy,
 saw the impropriety of having any useless brittle vessels about them: 
they broke them on purpose that they might be consistent with the 
profession they made of <i>seeking wisdom. </i>But we, who profess to 
have "found CHRIST the Wisdom of God," purchase such vessels and toys at
 a high rate; and instead of hiding them for shame, as Rachel did her 
teraphim for fear, we "write our <i>motto </i>over against the 
candlestick upon the plaster of the wall," and any man that fears the 
God of Daniel may, upon studying the Chinese characters, make out 
ANTINOMIANISM.  
</p><p>Our Lord, whose garment does not appear to 'have 
been cut in the height of the fashion, as it was made without seam, 
informs us that they who wear "soft clothing" and splendid apparel "are 
in kings' houses." But had he lived in our days, he might have found 
them in God's houses; in our fashionable churches or chapels. There you 
may find people professing to believe the Bible, who so conform to this 
present world, as to wear gold, pearls, and precious stones, when no 
distinction of office or state obliges them to it; in direct opposition 
to the words of two apostles: "Let not their adorning," says St. Peter, 
"be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, 
or of putting on of apparel." "Let them adorn themselves in modest 
apparel," adds St. Paul, "not with curled hair, or gold, or pearls, or 
costly array."  
</p><p>Multitudes of professors, far from being convinced
 of their sin in this respect, ridicule Mr. Wesley for bearing his 
testimony against it. The opposition he dares make to that growing 
branch of vanity, affords matter of pious mirth to a thousand 
Antinomians. Isaiah could openly reprove the "haughty daughters of Zion,
 who walked with stretched-forth necks, wanton eyes, and tinkling feet."
 He could expose "the bravery of their fashionable ornaments, their 
round tires like the moon, their chains, bracelets, headbands, rings, 
and earrings." But some of our humble Christian ladies will not bear a 
reproof from Mr. Wesley on the head of dress. They even laugh at him, as
 <i>a pitiful legalist:</i>  
</p><p>and yet, O the inconsistency of the Antinomian spirit! they call Isaiah <i>the evangelical prophet!</i>  
</p><p>Finery is often attended with an expensive table, 
at least with such delicacies as our purse can reach. St. Paul "kept his
 body under, and was in fastings often;" and our Lord gives us 
directions about the proper manner of fasting. But the apostle did not <i>know </i>the easy way to heaven taught by Dr. Crisp; and our Lord did not <i>approve </i>of
 it, or he would have saved himself the trouble of his directions. In 
general, we look upon fasting, much as we do upon penitential 
flagellation. Both equally raise our pity. We leave them both to Popish 
devotees. Some of our good old Church people will yet fast on Good 
Friday; but our fashionable believers begin to cast away that last scrap
 of self denial. Their faith, which should produce, animate, and 
regulate works of mortification, goes a shorter way to work,--it 
explodes them all.  
</p><p>"But perhaps 'we wrestle not with flesh and 
blood,' because we are entirely taken up with 'wrestling against 
principalities, powers, and spiritual wickednesses in high places.'"  
</p><p>Alas! I fear this is not the case. Few of us know 
what it is "to cry out of the deep," to pray and believe, till in the 
name of Jesus we force our way beyond flesh and blood, come within the 
reach of the eternal world, conflict in an agony with the powers of 
darkness, vanquish Apollyon in all his attacks, and continue wrestling 
till the day of eternity break upon us, and the God of Jacob "bless us 
with all spiritual benedictions in heavenly places." John Bunyan's 
pilgrim, the old Puritans, and the first Quakers, had such engagements, 
and gained such victories; but they soon got over the hedge of internal 
activity, into the smooth easy path of Laodicean formality. Most of us, 
called Methodists, have already followed them; and when we are in that 
snare, Satan scorns to conflict with us; puny flesh and blood are more 
than a match for us. We fall asleep under their bewitching power, and 
begin to dream strange dreams. "Our salvation is finished, we have got 
above legality, we live without frames and feelings, we have attained 
Christian liberty, we are perfect in Christ, we have nothing to do, our 
covenant is sure," &amp;c. True! But unhappily it is a covenant with the
 flesh. Satan, who is too wise to break it by rousing us in the spirit, 
leaves us to our delusions; and we think ourselves in the kingdom of 
God, when we are only in a fool's paradise.  
</p><p>"At midnight, I will rise and praise thee," said 
once a pious Jew; but we pious Christians, who enjoy both health and 
strength, are imprisoned within our bed curtains, long after the sun has
 "called <i>the diligent </i>to their labour." When "the fear of the 
Lord" was in us "the beginning of wisdom," we durst "not so confer with 
flesh and blood." We had then a little faith; and, so far as it went, it
 showed itself by our works. Then we could without hesitation and from 
our hearts pray, "Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy 
faithful people, that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good
 works, may by thee be plenteously rewarded, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord." <i>(Collect for the last Sunday in Trinity.) </i>We believed 
there was some truth in these words of our Lord: "Except a man forsake 
all that he hath, deny himself, and take up his cross daily, he cannot 
be my disciple. He that will save his life shall lose it, and he that 
will lose his life for my sake shall find it. If thine eye offend thee, 
pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, 
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. Strive to enter in at 
the strait gate; for I say unto you, that many shall seek to enter in, 
and shall not be able;" because they will seek to enter in at the <i>wide, </i>rather than the <i>strait gate; </i>the
 Antinomian or Pharisaic, rather than the evangelically legal gate of 
salvation. But now "we know better," say some of us, "we have got over 
our scruples and legality." We can "conform to this present world;" 
cleave to instead of "forsaking all we have," and even grasp what we 
have not. What a strange way this of "growing in grade, and in the 
knowledge of Christ crucified!"  
</p><p>Daniel informs us, that he "made his petition <i>three </i>times," and David, that he offered up his "praises <i>seven </i>times
 a day." Once also, like them, we had fixed hours for private prayer and
 self examination, for reading the Scriptures, and meditating upon them 
perhaps upon our knees; but we thought this was legality too; and under 
the specious pretence of going beyond forms, and learning "to pray 
always," we first threw away our forms, and, soon after, our endeavours 
to watch unto prayer. Now we scarcely ever, for any length of time, 
solemnly bend the knee before "our Father who sees in secret." And, 
instead of leaning on Christ's bosom in all the means of grace, we take 
our graceless rest on the bosom of that painted Jezebel, <i>formality.</i>  
</p><p>If we are backward in performing that leading work of PIETY, <i>secret prayer, </i>is
 it a wonder if, in general, we are averse to every work of MERCY that 
costs us something, beside a little of our superfluous money? And would 
to God some did not even grudge this, when it is pressed out of their 
purses, by the importunate address of those who beg for the poor! 
However, we give yet at the door of a church, or at the communion; 
whether with indifference or joy, whether out of custom, shame, or love,
 we seldom examine. But that important branch of St. James' "pure and 
undefiled religion before God, even the Father," which consists "in 
visiting the fatherless and widows in their afflictions," is, with many,
 almost as much but of date as a pilgrimage to our Lady of Loretto.  
</p><p>0 ye forsaken sons of poverty, and ancient 
daughters of sorrow, who pine away in your desolate garrets or cellars, 
without fire in winter, destitute of food, physic, or nurse in sickness!
 raise a moment your emaciated bodies, wrapped up in thread-bare 
blankets, if you are possessed of any such covering, and tell me, tell 
the world, how many of our gay professors of religion have sought and 
found you out in your deplorable circumstances! How many are come to 
visit, in you, and to worship, with you, "the Man of sorrows" who once 
lay on the cold ground in a bloody sweat! When did they "make your bed 
in your sickness?" When have they kindly inquired into all your wants, 
sympathized in all your temptations, supported your drooping heads in a 
fainting fit, revived your sinking spirits with suitable cordials, 
gently wiped your cold sweats, or mixed them with their tears of pity?  
</p><p>Alas! you sometimes find more compassion and 
assistance in your extremity from those who never "name the name of 
Christ," than from our easy, Antinomian, Laodicean <i>believers. </i>Their wants are richly supplied; that is enough: they do not inquire into yours, and <i>you </i>are
 ashamed or afraid to trouble them with the dismal story. Nor indeed 
would some of them understand you if you did. Their uninterrupted 
abundance makes them as incapable of feeling for you, as the warm 
inhabitants of Ethiopia are to feel for the frozen Icelanders.  
</p><p>While the table of some believers, (so called,) is
 alternately loaded with a variety of delicate meats and rich wines, 
what have <i>ye </i>to sustain sinking nature? Alas! one can soon see 
your all of food and physic. A pitcher of water stands by your bed side 
upon a stool, the only piece of furniture left in your wretched 
apartment. The Lord God bless the poor widow that brought it you, with 
her <i>two mites! </i>Heaven reward a thousand-fold the loving creature,
 that not only shares with you, but freely bestows upon you "all her 
living, even all that she has," when <i>they </i>forgot to inquire after you, and to send you something out of their luxurious abundance! "The Son of man, <i>once </i>forsaken
 by all the disciples, and comforted by an angel, make her bed in the 
time of sickness!" and a waiting band of celestial spirits "carry" her 
charitable soul "into Lazarus' bosom" in the awful hour of dissolution! I
 had rather be in her case, though she should not confidently profess 
the faith, than in <i>yours, O </i>ye caressed believers, who let your 
affluence overflow to those that have more need to learn frugality in 
the school of scarceness, than to receive bounties which feed their 
sensuality, and indulge their pride.  
</p><p>And ye women professing godliness, who enjoy the 
comforts of health and abundance, in whose "streets there is no 
complaining, no decay, Whose daughters are as the polished corners of 
the temple!" when did <i>you </i>ever want visiters? Alas! ye have too 
many, for the good they do you, or that you do them. Does not your 
conversation, which begins with the love of Jesus, terminate in 
religious scandal; as naturally as your soul, which once "began in the 
spirit, ends now in the flesh!" o that your visiters were as ready to 
attend work houses, jails, infirmaries, and hospitals, as they are to 
wait upon you! O that at least, like the Dorcases, the Phebes, and 
Priscillas of old, you would teach them cheerfully to work for the poor,
 to be the free servants of the Church, and tender nurses of the sick! O
 that they saw in you all, now the holy women, "the widows who were 
widows indeed," formerly "entertained strangers, washed the saints' 
feet, instructed the younger women, and continued night and day in 
prayer!" But alas! "the love of many," once warm as the smoking flax, 
"is waxed cold," instead of taking fire, and flaming. They who once 
began "to seek the profit of many," now seek "their own" ease, or 
interest; their own honour, or indulgence.  
</p><p>Almost all, when they come to the foot of the hill
 Difficulty, take their leave of Jesus as a guide, because he leads on 
through spiritual death to the regeneration. Some, disliking that 
"door," like "thieves and robbers, climb up" an easier way. And others, 
leaving the highway of the <i>cross, </i>under the fair pretence that 
blind Papists walk therein, make for themselves and others broad and 
downward roads, to ascend the steep hill of Zion.  
</p><p>Those easy paths are innumerable, like the people 
that walk in them. o that "my eyes, like David's, did run down like 
water, because men," professing godliness, "keep not God's law," and are
 even offended at it! "Their mouth talketh of vanity; they dissemble 
with their double heart, and their right hand is a right hand of <i>sloth, or positive </i>iniquity."
 O that I had the tenderness of St. Paul, "to tell you, even weeping, of
 those who mind earthly things;" those "who have sinned and have not 
repented;" those who, while they boast they "are made free by the Son" 
of God, are "brought under the power of <i>many </i>things;" whom 
foolish desires, absurd fears, undue attachments, imported 
superfluities, and disagreeable habits, keep in the most ridiculous 
bondage!  
</p><p>"0 that my head were waters, and my eyes fountains
 of tears," to deplore, with Jeremiah, "the slain of the daughter of 
God's people, who live in pleasure, and are dead while they live!" And 
to lament over spiritual Pharisees of every sort; those who say, "Stand 
by, I am holier than thou;" and those who fix the names of <i>poor creature! blind! </i>and <i>carnal! </i>upon every publican they see in the temple; and boldly placing themselves among <i>the elect, </i>"thank God they are not as other men," and in particular as <i>the reprobates!</i>  
</p><p>Who can number "the adulterers and adulteresses, 
who know not that the friendship of the world is enmity against God'?" 
The concealed idolaters, who have their "chambers of imagery within, and
 set up their idols in their hearts?" The envious Cains, who carry 
murder in their breasts? The profane Esaus, who give up their birthright
 for a sensual gratification; and covetous Judases, who "sell the truth"
 which they should <i>buy, </i>and part with Christ "for filthy lucre's 
sake?" The sons of God, who look at the fair daughters of men, and take 
to themselves wives of all whom they choose'? The gay Dinahs, who "visit
 the daughters of the land," and come home polluted in body or in soul. 
The filthy Onans, "who defile the temple of God." "The prophets of 
Bethel," who deceive the "prophets of Judah," entice them out of the way
 of self denial, and bring the roaring lion and death upon them. The 
fickle Marcuses, who depart when they should "go to the work." The 
self-made prophets, who "run before they are sent," and scatter instead 
of "profiting the people." The spiritual Absaloms, who rise against 
their fathers in the Gospel, and in order to reign without them, raise a
 rebellion against them. The furious Zedekiahs, who "make themselves 
horns of iron to push" the true servants of the Lord, because they will 
not "prophesy smooth things and deceit," as they do'?  
</p><p>Who can count the fretful Jonahs, who are "angry 
to death" when the worm of disappointment "smites the gourd" of their 
creature happiness'? The weak Aarons, who dare not resist a multitude, 
and are carried by the stream into the greatest absurdities. The jealous
 Miriams, who rise against the ministers that God honours. The crafty 
Zibas, who calumniate and supplant their brethren. The treacherous 
Joabs, who <i>kiss </i>them, to get an opportunity of "stabbing them 
under the fifth rib." The busy sons of Zeruiah, who perpetually stir up 
resentment and wrath. The mischievous Doegs, who carry about poisonous 
scandal, and blow up the fire of discord. The hypocritical Gehazis, who 
look like saints before their masters and ministers, and yet can 
impudently lie, and impiously cheat. The Gibeonites, always busy in 
hewing wood and drawing water, in going through the drudgery of outward 
services, without ever aspiring at the adoption of sons. The halting 
Naarnans, who serve the Lord and bow to Rimmon. The backsliding 
Solomons, who once chose wisdom, but now pursue folly in her most 
extravagant and impious forms. The apostatizing Alexanders, who "tread 
under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant, 
wherewith they were sanctified, an unholy thing." And, to include 
multitudes in one class, the Samaritans, who, by a common mixture of 
truth and error, of heavenly and earthly mindedness, "worship the Lord, 
and serve their gods;" are one day for God, and the next for Mammon? Or 
the thousands in Israel, who "halt between two opinions," crying out 
when Elijah prevails, "The Lord, he is the God!" and when Jezebel 
triumphs, returning to the old song, <i>"0 Baal, save us! O </i>trinity of the world, <i>money, pleasure, </i>and <i>honour, </i>make us happy!"  
</p><p>VI. Time would fail to describe the innumerable 
branches of Antinomianism, with all the fruits they bear. It may be 
compared to the astonishing tree which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his 
mysterious dream: "A strong tree set in the midst of the <i>church; </i>the
 height thereof reaches unto heaven, and the sight thereof unto the ends
 of the earth. Its leaves are fair, and its fruit much." Thousands sleep
 under its fatal shadow, and myriads feed upon its pernicious fruit. At a
 distance it looks like "the tree of life planted in the midst of 
paradise;" but it only proves "the tree of knowledge of good and evil." 
The woman, (the Antinomian Church,) is deceived by the appearance. "She 
sees that it is good for food, pleasant to the eye, and desirable to 
make one wise." She eats to the full, and flushed with fond hopes of 
heaven, tiny, fancying herself as God, she presents of the poisonous 
fruit that intoxicates her, to the nobler part of the Church, the 
obedient members of the second Adam.  
</p><p>0 ye sons of God, and daughters of Abraham, who, 
in compliance with the insinuation of this deceived Eve, have already 
stretched forth your hands to receive her fatal present, instantly draw 
them back, for eternal "death is in the <i>fruit!</i>" Flee from the 
tree on which she banquets to the tree of life, the despised cross of 
Jesus; and there feed on "him crucified," till you are "crucified with 
him;" till the "body of sin is destroyed," and you feel eternal life 
abundantly circulating through all your sanctified powers.  
</p><p>And ye uncorrupted, self-denying followers of 
Jesus, whom love and duty still compel to bear your cross after him, 
join to pray that "the Watcher and his holy ones may come down from 
heaven, and cry aloud, Hew down the tree of <i>Antinomianism; </i>cut 
off its branches, shake off its leaves, scatter its fruit, and let not 
even the stump of its roots be left in the earth! Your prayer is 
heard:-- He comes! he comes! the Judge severe!  
</p><p>The seventh trumpet speaks him near.  
</p><p>Behold, he appears in his glory, "with ten 
thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all. The thrones are 
cast down; the Ancient of days doth sit, whose garment is white as snow,
 and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne is like the fiery 
flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issues, and comes 
forth from before him: thousand thousands minister unto him, and ten 
thousand times ten thousand stand before him. The trumpet sounds: the 
sea gives up the dead which are in it, death and hades deliver up the 
dead which are in them." The just are separated from the unjust; and 
while the "earth and the heaven flee away from the face of him that sits
 on the great <i>resplendent </i>throne, and there is found no place for
 them, the judgment is set, the books are opened, and the dead, small 
and great, are judged, every one according to their works."  
</p><p>Fear not, ye righteous. Ye are "in the hand of the
 Lord, and there shall no torment touch you. In the sight of the unwise 
ye seemed to die," they laughed at your dying daily: "but ye are in 
peace, and your joy is full of immortality." Having been a little 
chastised, you shall be greatly rewarded; for God proved you, and found 
you worthy for himself. And now that "the time of your visitation is 
come," judge the nations, and reign with your Lord for ever; for, "such 
as are faithful in love shall abide with him; grace and mercy are to his
 saints, and he careth for his elect: he sets his sheep on his right 
hand," and stretching it toward them with ravishing looks of benignity 
and love, he finally justifies <i>by works </i>those whom he freely justified <i>by faith. </i>How sublime and solemn is the sentence!  
</p><p>"'Come, ye blessed of my Father! inherit the 
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was 
hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a
 stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and 
ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me!' And do not ask, with
 astonishment, WHEN you gave me all these tokens of your love: for 
whatever you did out of regard to me, my law, and my people, you did it 
'in my name;' and whatever you did 'in my name' to the least of my 
creatures, and in particular 'to the least of these my brethren, you did
 it unto me!'"  
</p><p>As if he said, "Think not that I am biassed by 
lawless partiality. No: I am 'the Author of eternal salvation to them 
that obeyed me,' and made a right use of my sanctifying blood. Such are 
'the blessed of my Father;' and such are ye. 'Your faith unfeigned' 
produced unfeigned love: you 'loved not in word only, but in deed and in
 truth:' witness the works of mercy that adorned your lives, or the 
fruits of the Spirit that now replenish your souls. 'You, of all the 
families of the earth, have I known' with approbation. Ye have not 
'denied me in works;' or, if ye have, bitter repentance, and purifying, 
renovating faith followed your denial; and by 'keeping that faith, ye 
continued in my covenant, and endured unto the end.'  
</p><p>"Thou seest it, righteous Father, for to thee the 
books are always open. Thou readest 'my laws in their minds,' and 
beholdest my loving precepts 'written in their hearts:' I therefore ' 
confess them before thee;' and before you, my angels, who have seen them
 agonize, and 'follow me 'through the regeneration.' I take the new 
heavens and the new earth to witness, that 'I am to them a God, and they
 are to me a people. They walked WORTHY of God, who called them to his 
kingdom and glory; <i>therefore </i>they are worthy of me.'  
</p><p>"I have confessed your PERSONS, O ye 'just men 
made perfect!' Ye precious jewels of my mediatorial crown; let me next 
reward your WORKS. In the days of my flesh I declared, that 'a cup of 
water given in my name,' (and my name ye know is Mercy, Goodness, and 
Love,) 'should in no wise lose its reward;' and that 'whosoever should 
forsake' earthly friends or property for righteousness' sake, should 
have 'a hundred fold, and everlasting life.' The pillars of heaven have 
given way; but my promise stands firm as the basis of my throne. Triumph
 in my faithfulness, as you have in my forgiving love. I bestow, on all,
 crowns of blissful immortality; 'I appoint unto each a kingdom' which 
shall not be destroyed. Be 'kings and priests unto God for ever.' 
Prepare to follow me to the realms of glory, and there 'whatsoever is 
right (dicaion) that shall ye receive;' in <i>just </i>proportion to the various degrees of perfection, with which you have obeyed my law, and improved your talents."  
</p><p>Thus are the persons of the righteous accepted, 
and their works "praised in the gate" of heaven, and "rewarded in the 
kingdom of their Father." Thus they receive crowns of life and glory; 
but it is only to cast them, to all eternity, with unutterable 
transports, grateful humble love, at the feet of Him who was crowned 
with piercing thorns, and hung bleeding upon the cross, to purchase 
their thrones.  
</p><p>While they shout, "Salvation to God and the Lamb!"
 the Judge turns to the left hand, where trembling myriads stand waiting
 for their fearful doom. O how does confusion cover their faces, and 
guilty horror rack their breasts, while he says, with the firmness of 
the eternal Lawgiver, and the majesty of the Lord of lords:--" Depart 
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and 
his angels! For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and
 ye gave me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked. 
and ye clothed me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not!"*  
</p><p>* [Should some sincere followers of Christ read these lines, and be convinced they never visited Christ <i>in prison, </i>never entertained him as a <i>stranger, &amp;c, </i>it
 is proper they should be bumbled for having overlooked this important 
part of "pure religion;" and consider next how far it is in their power 
literally to practise it. Some live at a great distance from prisons, 
and are necessarily detained at home. Some (as women) could not, in many
 places, visit prisoners with decency. Others are altogether unable to 
do good to the souls or bodies of the sick and captives, being 
themselves sick, poor, and confined. If thou art in any of these cases, 
believer, canst not thou influence others to do what is out of thy 
power? Canst thou not send the relief thou art unable to carry, and show
 thy good will by cutting off thy superfluities, sparing some of thy 
conveniences, and at times a little of thy necessaries, for thy sick, 
naked, hungry, or imprisoned Lord? If thou art so indigent and infirm, 
that thou canst absolutely do nothing for the bodies of thy fellow 
creatures, endeavour to do works of mercy for their souls; exhort, 
reprove, comfort, instruct, as thou canst, all round thee in meekness of
 wisdom. If thou canst do works of mercy neither with thy tongue, hands,
 nor feet, then be the more diligent to do them with thy <i>heart. </i>In
 spirit, visit prisons and sick beds. If thou hast no house to take in 
strangers, open to them thy heart; earnestly recommend them to God, who 
can supply all their wants, and open to them the gate of heaven, when 
they lie under a hedge, as he once did to Jacob in the fields of Bethel.
 Give thy heart continually to the Lord, and thou givest more than a 
mountain of gold; and the moment thou canst "give a cup of water in his 
name," bestow it as freely as he did his blood; remembering, "God loves a
 cheerful giver, and that it is accepted according to what a man hath, 
and not according to what he hath not."]  
</p><p>Some are not yet <i>speechless; </i>they only 
falter. With the trembling insolence of Adam, not yet driven out of 
paradise, they even dare to plead their desperate cause. While stubborn 
sons of Belial say, "Lord, thy Father is merciful: and if thou didst die
 for <i>all, </i>why not for <i>us?" </i>While the obstinate Pharisees 
plead the good they did in their own name to supersede the Redeemer's 
merit, methinks I hear a bold Antinomian address thus the Lord of glory.  
</p><p>"'Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a 
stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to 
thee?' Had we seen thee, dear Lord, in any distress, how gladly would we
 have relieved thy wants! Numbers can witness how well we spoke of thee 
and thy righteousness: it was all our boast. Bring it out in this 
important hour. Hide not the Gospel of thy free ,grace. We always 
delighted in pure doctrine, in <i>salvation without any condition; especially without the condition of </i>WORKS. Stand, gracious Lord, stand by us, and the preachers of thy free grace, who <i>made us hope thou wouldest confirm their word.</i>  
</p><p>"While they taught us to call thee, <i>Lord! Lord! </i>they assured us that love would <i>constrain </i>us
 to do good works; but finding no inward constraint to entertain 
strangers, visit the sick, and relieve prisoners, we did it not; 
supposing we were not called thereto. They continually told us, ' <i>human righteousness was mere filth before thee;</i> <i>and we could not appear, but to our everlasting shame, in any righteousness but thine in the day of judgment.' </i>As to works, we were afraid of doing them, lest we should have 'worked out' abomination instead of' our salvation.'  
</p><p>"And indeed, Lord, what need was there of our 'working it out?' For they perpetually assured us, it was <i>finished; </i>saying, <i>If
 we did any thing toward it, we worked for life, fell from grace like 
the bewitched Galatians, spoiled thy perfect work, and exposed ourselves
 to the destruction which awaits yonder trembling Pharisees.</i>  
</p><p>"They likewise assured us, <i>that all depended on </i>THY <i>decrees; and if we could but firmly believe our election, it was a sure sign we were interested in thy salvation. </i>We
 did so; and now, Lord, for the sake of a few dung works we have 
omitted, let not our hope perish! Let not electing and everlasting love 
fail! Visit our offences with a rod, but take not thy loving kindness 
altogether from us; and break not David's covenant, 'ordered in all 
things and sure,' of which we have so often made our boast.  
</p><p>"May it please thee also to consider, that if we did not love and assist some of those whom thou callest <i>thy brethren, </i>it
 was because they appeared to us so exceeding legal; so strongly set 
against free grace, that we judged them to be Obstinate Pharisees, and 
dangerous reprobates. We therefore thought, that, in hating and opposing
 them, we did thee service, and walked in thy steps. For thou hast said,
 'It is enough if the servant is as his Lord:' and supposing 'thou didst
 hate them,' as thou dost Satan; <i>we </i>thought we need not be more righteous than thou, by loving them more than thou didst.  
</p><p>"0 suffer us to speak on, and tell thee, we were 
champions for thy free grace. Like true Protestants, we could have 
burned against the doctrine of a <i>second justification by works. </i>Let
 then 'grace' justify us 'freely without works.' Shut those books,* 
filled with the account of our deeds, open the arms of thy mercy, and 
receive us just as <i>we </i>are.  
</p><p>* [This plea is excellent when a man comes to 
Christ, his high Priest, as a sinner for pardon and holiness, or for his
 first justification on earth?; but it will be absurd, when he "stands 
before the throne" of Christ as a rebellious subject, or "before his 
judgment seat" as a criminal in the last day.]  
</p><p>"If <i>free grace </i>cannot justify us alone, let <i>faith </i>do it, together with free grace. We do <i>believe </i>finished
 salvation, Lord; we can join in the most evangelical creeds, and are 
ready to confess the virtue of thy atoning blood. But if thou sayest, we
 have 'trampled it under foot, and made it a common thing,' grant us our
 last request, and it is enough.  
</p><p>"Cut out the immaculate garment of 'thy righteousness' into robes that may fit us all, and put them upon us by <i>imputation: </i>so
 shall our nakedness be gloriously covered. We confess we have not dealt
 our bread to the hungry; but impute to us thy feeding five thousand 
people with loaves and fishes. We have seldom given drink to the 
thirsty, and often 'put our bottle' to those who were not athirst; but 
impute to us thy turning water into wine, to refresh the guests at the 
marriage feast in Cana; and thy loud call, 'in the last day of the feast
 at Jerusalem:<i> If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink!' </i>We
 never supposed it was our duty to 'be given to hospitality:' but impute
 to us thy loving invitations to strangers, thy kind assurances of 
receiving 'all that come to thee;' thy comfortable promises of 'casting 
out none,' and of feeding them even with thy 'flesh and blood.' We did 
not clothe the naked as we had opportunity and ability;- but impute to 
us thy patient parting with thy seamless garment for the benefit of thy 
murderers. We did not visit sick beds and prisons, we were afraid of 
fevers, and especially of the jail distemper; but compassionately impute
 to us thy visiting Jairus' daughter, and Peter's wife's mother, who lay
 sick of a fever; and put to our account thy visiting putrefying Lazarus
 in the offensive prison of the grave.  
</p><p>"Thy imputed righteousness, Lord, can alone answer all the demands of thy law and Gospel. We did not dare to <i>fast; </i>we should have been called <i>legal </i>and <i>Papists </i>if
 we had; but thy forty days' fasting in the wilderness, and thy 
continual abstinence, imputed to us, will be self denial enough to 
justify us ten times over. We did not 'take up our cross;' but impute to
 us thy 'carrying THINE;' and even fainting under the oppressive load. 
We did not 'mortify the deeds of the flesh, that we might live:' this 
would have been evidently <i>working for life; </i>but impute to us the crucifixion of <i>thy </i>body,
 instead of our 'crucifying our flesh, with its affections and lusts.' 
We hated private prayer; but impute to us thy love of that duty, and the
 prayer thou didst offer upon a mountain all night. We have been rather 
hard to forgive; but that defect will be abundantly made up if thou 
impute to us thy forgiving of the dying thief: and, if that will not do,
 add, we beseech thee, the merit of that good saying of thine, ' 
Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.' We have cheated the king of his 
customs; but no matter; only impute to us thy exact paying of the 
tribute money, together with thy good advice, ' Render unto Cesar the 
things which are Cesar's.'  
</p><p>"It is true, we have brought up our children in 
vanity, and thou never hadst any to bring up. May not thy mercy find out
 an expedient, and impute to us, instead of it, thy obedience to thy 
parents? And if we have received the sacrament unworthily, and thou 
canst not cover that sin with thy worthy <i>receiving, </i>indulge us with the imputation of thy worthy <i>institution </i>of it, and that will do yet better.  
</p><p>"In short, Lord, own us <i>freely </i>as thy 
children. Impute to us thy perfect righteousness. Cast it as a cloak 
upon us to cover our filthy souls and polluted bodies. <i>We will have no righteousness but thine. </i>Make no mention, we beseech thee, of <i>our </i>righteousness
 and personal holiness; they are but" filthy rags," which thy purity 
forbids thee to take into heaven; therefore accept us without, and we 
shall shout, <i>Free grace! Imputed righteousness! </i>and <i>finished salvation! </i>to eternity."  
</p><p>While the bold Antinomian offers, or prepares to 
offer, this most impious plea, the Lord, who "is of purer eyes than to 
behold iniquity," casts a flaming look upon all the obstinate violators 
of his law. It pierces their conscience, rouses all its drowsy powers, 
and restores their memory to its original perfection. Not one wish 
passed their heart, or thought their brain, but is instantly brought to 
their remembrance. "The books are opened" in their own breast, and every
 character has a voice which answers to the voice of "the Lion of the 
tribe of Judah."  
</p><p>"Shall I pervert judgment," says he, "and justify 
the wicked for a bribe? the bribe of your abominable praise? 'Think 
you,' by your base flatteries 'to escape the righteous judgment of God?'
 Is not my 'wrath revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and 
unrighteousness. of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness?' Much 
more against you, 'ye vessels of wrath;' who hold an impious absurdity 
in matchless insolence.  
</p><p>"Said I not to Cain himself at the beginning, 'If 
thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted?' Personal holiness, which ye
 scorned, is 'the Wedding garment' I now look for. 'I swear in my 
wrath,' that without it, 'none shall taste of my <i>heavenly </i>supper.
 Ye have rejected my word' of commandment, 'and I reject you from being 
kings. Ye cried unto me and I delivered you. Yet have ye forsaken me and
 served other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more. Go and cry 
unto the gods whom ye have chosen. I wound the hairy scalp of such as 
have gone on still in their wickedness. Whosoever hath sinned against me
 <i>to the last, </i>him do I blot out of my book.' And this have you 
done, 'ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, awake to everlasting shame!
 Will ye set the briers and thorns against me in battle,' and make them 
pass 'for roses of Sharon and lilies of the valleys? I will go through 
them <i>with a look, </i>and consume them together. The day is come that burneth like an oven; all that have DONE wickedly are stubble, and <i>must </i>be
 burned up root and branch. Upon such I rain snares, fire and brimstone,
 storm and tempest: this is the portion of their cup. Drink the dregs of
 it. Ye hypocrites, DEPART! and wring them out in everlasting burnings.'  
</p><p>"Said I not, 'He that does good is of God; but he 
that does evil is not of God? Be faithful unto death, and I will give 
you the crown of life; for he that overcometh, <i>and he only, </i>shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life?' And shall I keep <i>your </i>name in that book for having 'continued in doing evil?' Shall I give <i>you </i>the crown of life for having been <i>unfaithful </i>unto death, and clothe <i>you </i>with the bright robes of my glory, because you <i>defiled </i>your <i>garments </i>to
 the last? Delusive hope! Because 'your mind was not to do good,' be ye 
rather 'clothed with cursing, like as with a garment! Let it come into 
your bowels like water, and like oil into your bones!'"  
</p><p>VII. If "these shall go into eternal punishment;" 
if such will be the dreadful end of all the impenitent Nicolaitans; if 
our churches and chapels swarm with them; if they crowd our communion 
tables; if they are found in most of our houses, and too many of our 
pulpits; if the seeds of their fatal disorder are in all our breasts; if
 they produce Antinomianism around us in all its forms; if we see bold 
Antinomians in <i>principle, </i>barefaced Antinomians in <i>practice, </i>and sly <i>Pharisaical Antinomians, </i>who
 speak well of the law, to break it with greater advantage: should not 
every one "examine himself whether he be in the faith," and whether he 
have a <i>holy Christ </i>in his heart, as well as a <i>sweet Jesus </i>upon
 his tongue; lest he should one day swell the tribe of Antinomian 
reprobates? Does it not become every minister of Christ to drop his 
prejudices, and consider whether he ought not to imitate the old 
watchman, who, fifteen months ago, gave a" legal alarm" to all the 
watchmen that are in connection with him? And should we not do the 
Church excellent service, if, agreeing to lift up our voices together 
against the common enemy, we gave God no rest in prayer, and our hearers
 in preaching, till we all "did our first works," and "our latter end," 
like Job's, "exceeded our beginning?"  
</p><p>Near forty years ago, some of the ministers of 
Christ, in our Church, Were called out of the extreme of self 
righteousness. Fleeing from it, we have run into the opposite with equal
 violence. Now that we have learned wisdom by what we have suffered, in 
going beyond the limits of truth both ways, let us return to a just 
Scriptural medium. Let us equally maintain the two evangelical axioms on
 which the Gospel is founded: (1.) "All our salvation is of God by free 
grace, through the alone merits of Christ." And (2.) "All our damnation 
is of ourselves, through our avoidable unfaithfulness."  
</p><p>This second truth, as important as one half of the
 Bible, on which it rests, has not only been set aside as useless by 
thousands, but generally exploded as unscriptural, dangerous, and 
subversive of true Protestantism. Thus has the Gospel balance been 
broken, and St. James' "pure religion" despised. What we owe to truth in
 a state of oppression, hath engaged me to cast two mites into the scale
 of truth, which Mr. Wesley has the courage to defend against multitudes
 &amp;f good men, who keep one another in countenance under their common
 mistake. I do not want <i>his </i>scale to preponderate to the 
disadvantage of free grace. If it did, far from rejoicing in it, I would
 instantly throw the insignificant weight of my pen into the other 
scale; being fully persuaded that Christ can never be so truly honoured,
 nor souls so well edified, when we overdo on either side of the 
question, as when we Scripturally maintain the <i>whole "truth </i>as it is in Jesus."  
</p><p>"But are we not in as much danger from overdoing in Pharisaic <i>works, </i>as in Antinomian <i>faith?</i>"  
</p><p>Not at present. The stream runs too rapidly on the
 side of lawless faith, to leave any just room to fear we shall be 
immediately carried into excessive working. There would be some ground 
for this objection, if we saw most professors of religion obstinately 
refusing to drink any thing but water, eat any thing but dry bread or 
cheap vegetables; fasting themselves into mere skeletons; wearing 
sackcloth instead of soft linen; lying on the bare ground, with a stone 
for their pillow; imitating Origen, by literally "making themselves 
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake;" turning hermits, spending 
whole nights in contemplation in churches and church yards; giving away 
all their goods, the necessaries of life not excepted; allowing 
themselves only three or four hours' sleep, and even breaking that short
 rest to pray or praise; overpowering their bodies the next day with 
hard labour, to keep them under; scourging their backs unto blood every 
day; or forgetting themselves in prayer for hours in the coldest 
weather, till they have almost lost the use of their limbs. But I ask 
any unprejudiced person, who knows what is now called "Gospel liberty," 
whether we are in danger of being thus "righteous overmuch," or legal to
 such an extreme?  
</p><p>I grant, however, we are not absolutely safe from 
any quarter: let us therefore continually stand on our guard. The right 
wing of Emmanuel's army, which defends living faith, is partly gone over
 to the enemy, and fights under the Nicolaitan banner. The left wing, 
which defends good works, is far from being Out of the reach of those 
crafty adversaries. Therefore, as we are, or may be, attacked on every 
side, let us faithfully use "the word of truth, the power of God, and 
the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left." Let us 
gallantly fly where the attack is the hottest, which now, <i>in the religious world, </i>is evidently where gross CHRISTIANITY (if I may use the word) is continually obtruded upon us as true <i>Christianity: </i>I say, <i>in the religious world: </i>for,
 in this controversy, "what have I to do to judge them also that are 
without? Do not ye judge them that are within," and represent them as 
opposers of free grace?  
</p><p>Should Pharisees, while we are engaged in 
repelling the Nicolaitans, try to rob us of present and free 
justification by faith, under pretence of maintaining justification by 
works, in the last day: or should they set us upon unnecessary and 
unscriptural works, we shall be glad of your assistance to repel them 
also.  
</p><p>If you grant it us, and do not despise ours, the world shall admire, in the <i>Shulamite, </i>(the
 Church at unity in herself,) "the company of two armies, ready mutually
 to support each other against the opposite attacks of the Pharisees and
 the Nicolaitans; <i>the Popish workers </i>who exclude the Gospel, and the modern Gnostics, <i>the Protestant Anlinomians </i>who explode the law.  
</p><p>May the Lord God help us to sail safely through 
these opposite rocks, keeping at an equal distance from both, by taking 
Christ for our pilot, and the Scripture for our compass! So shall we 
enter full sail the double haven of present and eternal rest. Once we 
were in immediate danger of splitting upon "works without faith:" now we
 are threatened with destruction from faith "without works." May the 
merciful Keeper of Israel save us from both, by <i>a living faith, </i>legally productive of all good works, or <i>by good works, </i>evangelically springing from a living faith!  
</p><p>Should the Divine blessing upon these sheets, 
bring one single reader a step toward that good old way, or only confirm
 one single believer in it, I shall be "rewarded a hundred-fold" for 
this little "labour of love;" - and I shall be even content to see it 
represented as the invidious labour of malice: for what is my reputation
 to the profit of one blood-bought soul!  
</p><p>Beseeching you, dear sir, for whom these letters 
are first intended, to set me right where I am wrong; and not to despise
 what may recommend itself in them to reason and conscience, on account 
of the blunt and Helvetic manner in which they are written, I remain 
with sincere respect, honoured and reverend sir, your affectionate and 
obedient servant in the practical Gospel of Christ,

<p>J. FLETCHER.</p>
<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p>SINCE these Letters were sent to the press, I have
 seen a pamphlet, entitled, "A Conversation between Richard Hill, Esq., 
the Rev. Mr. Madan, and Father Walsh," a monk at Paris, who condemned 
Mr. Wesley's Minutes as "too near Pelagianism," and the author as "a 
Pelagian;" adding, that <i>"their </i>doctrine was a great deal nearer 
that of the Protestants." Hence the editor concludes, that "the 
principles in the extract of the Minutes are too rotten even for a 
Papist to rest upon; and supposes that Popery is about the midway 
between Protestantism and Mr. J. Wesley." I shall just make a few 
strictures upon that performance.  
</p><p>1. If an Arian came to me, and said, "You believe that 'Jesus Christ is God over all, blessed for ever!' <i>Pelagius, that heretic who was publicly excommunicated by the whole Catholic Church, </i>was
 of your sentiment, therefore you are a Pelagian; give up your heresy." 
Should I, upon such an assertion, give up the Godhead of our Saviour? 
Certainly not. And shall I, upon a similar argument, advanced by the 
help of a French monk, give up truths with which the practical Gospel of
 Jesus Christ must stand or fall? God forbid!  
</p><p>2. We desire to be confronted with all the pious 
Protestant divines, except those of Dr. Crisp's class, who are a party: 
but who would believe it? The suffrage of a Papist is brought against 
us! Astonishing! that our opposers should think it worth their while to 
raise one recruit against us in the immense city of Paris, where fifty. 
thousand might be raised against the Bible itself!  
</p><p>3. So long as Christ, the prophets, and apostles 
are for us, together with the multitude of the Puritan divines of the 
last century, we shall smile at an army of Popish friars. The knotted 
whips that hang by their sides will no more frighten us from our Bibles 
than the <i>ipse dixit </i>of a Benedictine monk will make us explode, as heretical, propositions which are demonstrated to be Scriptural.  
</p><p>4. An argument, which has been frequently used of 
late against the anti-calvinist divines, is, "This is downright Popery! 
This is worse than Popery itself!" And honest Protestants have been 
driven by it to embrace doctrines, which were once no less contrary to 
the dictates of their consciences than they are still to the word of 
God. It is proper, therefore, such persons should be informed, that St. 
Augustine, the Calvin of the fourth century, is one of the saints whom 
the popes have in the highest veneration; and that a great number of 
friars in the Church of Rome are champions for Calvinism, and oppose St.
 Paul's doctrine, that "the grace of God bringing salvation has appeared
 unto all men," as strenuously as some "real Protestants" among us. Now,
 if good father Walsh be one of that stamp, what wonder is it that he 
should so well agree with the gentlemen who consulted him! If Calvinism 
and Protestantism are synonymous terms, as some divines would make us 
believe, many monks may well say, that their doctrine is a great deal 
nearer that of the Protestants" than the Minutes; for they may even pass
 for "real Protestants."  
</p><p>5. But whether the good friar be a hot Jansenist, 
or only a warm Thomist, (so they call the Popish Calvinists in France,) 
we appeal from his bar to the tribunal of Jesus Christ, and from the 
published Conversation "to the law and the testimony." - What is the 
decision of a Popish monk to the express declarations of the Scripture, 
the dictates of common sense, the experience of regenerate souls, and 
the writings of a cloud of Protestant divines? No more than a grain of 
loose sand to the solid rock on which the Church is founded.  
</p><p>I hope the gentlemen concerned in the Conversation
 lately published, will excuse the liberty of this postscript. I 
reverence their piety, rejoice in their labours, and honour their warm 
zeal for their Protestant cause. But that very zeal, if not accompanied 
with a close attention to every part of the Gospel truth, may betray 
them into mistakes which may spread as far as their respectable names: I
 think it therefore my duty to publish these strictures, lest any of my 
readers should pay more regard to the good-natured friar, who has been 
pressed into the service of Dr. Crisp, than to St. John, St. Paul, St. 
James, and Jesus Christ, on whose plain declarations I have shown that 
the Minutes are founded.
