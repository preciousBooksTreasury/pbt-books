</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b>.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Mr. Berridge's uncommon piety and zeal give an uncommon sanction to his dangerous, though well-meant mistakes. <b> </b></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><b>SECTION I.</b>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Mr. Berridge advances the capital error of the 
Antinomians, when he says, that "faith must UTTERLY exclude ALL 
justification by works;" and when he represents "the passport of 
obedience" as a paper kite.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION II.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">A view of the doctrine of the Solifidians with 
respect to the Gospel law, or the law of liberty, which Mr. Berridge 
indirectly calls a "cobweb," and with respect to sincere obedience, 
which he directly calls "a Jack o'lantern:" with two notes, showing that
 Mr. Berridge holds the doctrine of merit of congruity, as much as 
Thomas Aquinas, and that Bellarrnine held absolute reprobation as much 
as Mr. Toplady.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION III.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">An answer to the dangerous arguments of Mr. 
Berridge against sincere obedience, in which it is proved that Christ is
 not "at the head of the Antinomian preachers" for making our duty 
feasible as redeemed sinners; and that Mr. Berridge's rash pleas against
 obedience, as the condition of eternal salvation, totally subvert faith
 itself, which he calls "the total term of all salvation."  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION IV.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">When Mr. Berridge grants that "our damnation is 
wholly from ourselves," h- grants that our salvation is suspended upon 
some term which through grace we have power to fulfil; and in this case,
 unconditional reprobation, absolute election, and finished salvation, 
are false doctrines; and Calvin's whole system stands upon a sandy 
foundation: with a note upon a pamphlet called "A Check upon Checks."  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION V.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Mr. Berridge candidly grants the conditionality of
 perseverance, and consequently of election, by showing much respect to 
"Sergeant IF," who "guards the camp of Jesus:" but soon picking a 
quarrel with the valiant sergeant, oddly discharges him as a Jew, opens 
the camp to the Antinomians, by opposing to them only a sham sentinel, 
and shows the foundation of Calvinism in a most striking light.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">CONCLUSION.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">In which the author expresses again his brotherly 
love for Mr. Berridge, makes an apology for the mistakes of his pious 
antagonist, and accounts for the oddity of his own style in answering 
him. <b> </b></font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b>.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">HAVING animadverted on Mr. Hill's <i>Finishing Stroke, </i>I
 proceed to ward off the first blow which the Rev. Mr. Berridge has 
given to practical religion. But before I mention his mistakes, I must 
do justice to his person. It is by no means my design to represent him 
as a divine who either leads a loose life, or intends to hurt the 
Redeemer's interest. His conduct as a Christian is exemplary; his 
labours as a minister are great; and I am persuaded that the wrong 
touches which he gives to the ark of godliness are not only undesigned, 
but intended to do God service.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">There are so many things commendable in the pious vicar of Ever-ton, and so much truth in his <i>Christian World Unmasked, </i>that
 I find it a hardship to expose the unguarded parts of that performance.
 But the cause of this hardship is the ground of my apology. Mr. 
Berridge is a good, an excellent man, therefore the Antinomian errors, 
which go abroad into the world with his letters of recommendation, which
 speak in his evangelical strain, and are armed with the poignancy of 
his wit, cannot be too soon pointed out, and too carefully guarded 
against. I flatter myself that this consideration will procure me his 
pardon for taking the liberty of despatching his valiant "sergeant," 
with some doses of rational and Scriptural antidotes for those who have 
drunk into the pleasing mistakes of his book, and want his piety to 
hinder them from carrying speculative into practical Antinomianism  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION I.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">ONE of my opponents has justly observed, that "the
 principal cause of controversy among us" is the doctrine of our 
justification by the works of faith in the day of judgment. At this 
rampart of practical godliness Mr. Berridge levels such propositions as 
these, in his <i>Christian World Unmasked: </i>(second edition, pp. 170, 171:) <i>"Final </i>justification by faith is the <i>capital </i>doctrine of the Gospel. Faith being the term of salvation, &amp;c, must <i>utterly </i>exclude <i>all </i>justification by works." And, (p. 26,) we read of "an <i>absolute </i>impossibility of being justified in any <i>manner </i>by our works."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If these positions are true, say, reader, if St. 
James, St. Paul, and Jesus Christ, did not advance great untruths when 
they said: <i>"By </i>works a man is justified, and not by faith only," 
James ii, 24. "For not the hearers of the law [of Christ] are just 
before God, but the doers shall be justified, &amp;c, in the day when 
God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ," Rom. ii, 13, 16. 
"For (adds our Lord, when speaking of the day of judgment) by thy words 
thou shalt be justified," &amp;c, Matt. xii, 37. Christian reader, say, 
who is mistaken, Christ and his apostles, or the late fellow of Clare 
Hall?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Mr. Berridge goes farther still. Without ceremony 
he shuts the gate of heaven against every man who seeks to be justified 
by works, according to our Lord's and St. James' doctrine. For when he 
has assured us, (p. 171,) that faith must utterly exclude all 
justification by works, he immediately adds, "And the man who seeks to 
be justified by his passport of obedience, will find no passage through 
the city gates." Might not our author have unmasked Calvinism a little 
more, and told the Christian world that the man who minds what Christ 
says shall be turned into hell.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">See the boldness of Solifidianism!* In our Lord's 
days believers were to keep their mouths as with a bridle, and to 
abstain from every idle word, lest in the day of judgment they should 
not be justified. In St. John's time they were to do Christ's 
commandments, that they might enter through the gates into the city, 
Rev. xxii, 14. But in our days, a Gospel minister assures us, (p. 171,) 
that the believer, who, according to our Lord's doctrine, seeks to be 
"justified by his passport of obedience, will find <i>no </i>passage through the city gates. He may talk of the tree of life, and soar up with his <i>paper kite </i>to
 the gates of paradise, but will find no entrance." I grant it, if an 
Antinomian pope has St. Peter's key; but so long as Christ has the key 
of David, so long as he opens, and no Solifidian shuts, the dutiful 
servant, instead of being sent flying to hell after the "paper kite" of 
obedience, will, through his Lord's merits, be honourably admitted into 
heaven by the passport of good works which he has about him. For though 
the remembrance of his sins, 'and the sight of his Saviour, will make 
him ashamed to produce it; yet he had rather die ten thousand deaths 
than be found without it. The celestial Porter, after having kindly 
opened it for him, will read it before an innumerable company of angels,
 and say, "Enter into the joy of thy Lord, for I was hungry and thou 
gayest me meat," &amp;c, Matt. xxv, 35, &amp;c.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[<i> * Solifidianism </i>is the doctrine of the Solifidians; and the Solifidians are men who, because sinners are justified <i>(sola fide) </i>by
 "sole faith" in the day of con. version, infer, as Mr. Berridge, that 
"believing is the total term of all salvation," and conclude, as Mr. 
Hill, that the doctrine of final justification by the works of faith in 
the great day is "full of rottenness and deadly poison." It is a softer 
word for <i>Antinomianism.</i>]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If the vicar of Everton throws in an Antinomian 
caveat against this "passport of obedience,"** and ridicules it still as
 a "paper kite," Isaiah and St. Paul will soon silence him. "Open ye the
 gates," says the evangelical prophet, "that the righteous nation which 
keepeth the truth [of the Gospel doctrines] may enter in:<i>" </i>for, 
adds the evangelical apostle, "Circumcision [including all professions 
of faith] is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Yea, 
though I have all faith and no charity, I am nothing," Isa. xxvi, 2; 1 
Cor. vii, 19; xiii, 2.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ ** I speak only of the obedience of faith. It is
 only for that obedience, and for the works of faith, that St. James 
pleads in his epistle, Mr. Wesley in the Minutes, and I in the Checks. 
All other obedience is insincere; all other works Pharisaical.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If I am at the city gates when Mr. Berridge will 
exclaim against the "passport of obedience," I think I shall venture to 
check his imprudence by the following questions:--Can there be a medium 
between not having a passport of obedience, and having one of 
disobedience? Must a man, to the honour of free grace, take a passport 
of refractoriness along with him 1 Must he bring a certificate of 
adultery and murder to be welcome into the New Jerusalem? I am persuaded
 that, with the utmost abhorrence, Mr. Berridge answers, "No!<i>" </i>But
 his great Diana speaks louder than he. and says, before all the world: 
"There is no need that he should have a testimonium of adultery and 
murder, but he may if he pleases. Nay, if he is so inclined, he may get a
 diploma of treachery and incest; it will never invalidate his title to 
glory; for, if David and the incestuous Corinthian had saving faith, 
inamissible, eternal life, and-finished salvation, when they committed 
their crimes; and if faith or believing (as Mr. Berridge affirms, p. 
168,) be the total term of all salvation," why might not every 
Christian, if he is so minded, murder his neighbour, worship idols, and 
gratify even incestuous lusts, as well as primitive backsliders, without
 risking his finished salvation! Upon this Antinomian axiom, advanced by
 Mr. Berridge, "believing is the total term of all salvation," I lay my 
engine, a grain of reason, and ask every non-prejudiced person who is 
able to conclude that two and two make four, whether we may not, without
 any magical power, heave morality out of the world, or Calvinism out of
 the Church!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If Mr. Berridge pleads, that, when he says, (p. 
168,) "Believing is the total term of all salvation," he means a faith 
"including and producing all obedience," I reply, Then he gives up 
Solifidianism; he means the very faith which I contend for in the 
Checks; and pressing him with his own definition of faith, I ask, How 
can a "faith including all obedience," include murder, as in the case of
 David; idolatry, as in the case of Solomon; lying, cursing, and denying
 Christ, as in the case of Peter; and even incest, as in the case of the
 apostate Corinthian? Are murder, idolatry, cursing, and incest, "all 
obedience?" If Mr. Berridge replies, "No:<i>" </i>then David, Solomon, 
&amp;c, lost the justifying faith of St. Paul when they lost the 
justifying works of St. James; and so Mr. Berridge gives up the point 
together with Calvinism. If he says, "Yes:<i>" </i>he not only gives up 
St. James' justification, but quite unmasks Antinomianism: and the 
rational world, who "come and peep," may see that his doctrine of grace 
is not a <i>chaste virgin, </i>but a <i>great Diana, </i>who pays as little regard to decency as she does to Scripture.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If this is a sophism, I humbly entreat the learned
 fellow of Clare Hall to convince the world of it, by showing where the 
fallacy lies. He can do it. if it can be done, "having consumed a deal 
of candle at a noted ball at Cambridge in lighting up a good 
understanding," even after he was declared <i>-master </i>of the <i>art </i>of
 logic. But if the dilemma is forcible, and grinds Calvinism as between 
an upper and nether mill stone, I hope that he will no longer oppose the
 dictates of reason, merely to pour contempt upon our Lord's doctrine of
 a believer's justification by the works of faith; and to sport himself 
with obedience, rendered as ridiculous as Samson was when the 
Philistines treated ohm as a blind mill horse.  </font>

</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><font size="4">SECTION II.</font></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p><font size="4">WE have already seen how Mr. Berridge gives "the 
passport of obedience" to the winds, as a boyish trumpery. To render the
 "paper kite" more contemptible, (p. 145,) he ties to it, instead of a 
tail, "a spruce new set of duties half a yard long, called legally 
evangelical and evangelically legal, unknown to Christ and his apostles,
 but discovered lately by some ingenious gentlemen." Just as if I, who 
have ventured upon those expressions, to indicate the harmony that 
subsists between the promises of the Gospel rind the duties of the law 
of liberty, and Mr. Wesley, who has let those compounded words pass in 
the Second Check, were the first men who have taught that believers "are
 not without law to God, but under a law to Christ," I Cor. ix, 21. Just
 as if nobody had said before us, "Do we make void the law through 
faith," or through the Gospel 1 "God forbid! Yea, we establish the law,"
 Rom. iii, 31: that is, by preaching <i>' </i>a faith that worketh by 
love," we establish the moral law; for "love is the fulfilling of it, 
and he that loveth another has fulfilled the law," Rom. xiii, 8,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">10. Not indeed the ceremonial law of Moses, for 
ceremonies and love arc not the same thing; nor yet the Adamic law of 
innocence, for if the. apostle had spoken of that law, he would have 
said, "He that has always loved another with perfect love has fulfilled 
the law." Therefore he evidently speaks of the evangelical law preached 
thus by St. James to believers: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that 
shall be judged by the law of liberty," James ii, 12. A law which is so 
called, not because it gives us the least liberty to sin; but because, 
during the day of salvation, it indulges us with the precious liberty to
 repent of our former sins, and come to Christ for pardon, and for 
stronger supplies of sanctifying grace.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">However, Mr. Berridge, as if the Antinomians had 
already burned St. James' Epistle, says, (p. 144,) after speaking of the
 law of innocence given to Adam before the fall, "All other laws [and 
consequently the law of liberty] are cobwebs of a human brain." What, 
sir, do you think that Moses was a spiritual spider, when he wove the 
ceremonial law? Can you possibly imagine that David's "blessed man, 
whose delight is in the law of the Lord, meditates day and night in a 
law" which bids him "stand upon his own legs," and absolutely despair of
 mercy-upon "a single trip?" Would you, on second thoughts, say that St.
 Paul and St. James weave "cobwebs" in the brains of mankind, when they 
declare that "the end of the commandment [or of Christ's law] is 
charity, from a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfeigned;" 
when they speak of fulfilling the royal law, according to the Scripture:
 "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" or when they assure us, 
"that he who loveth another hath fulfilled it;" and exhort us to "bear 
one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ?" See I Tim. i, 
5; James ii, 8; Gal. v, 13, and vi, 2.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I shall not borrow here the rash expression which 
Mr. Berridge uses when he confounds original worthiness and derived 
merit, and reflects upon Christ, who evidently attributes the latter to 
believers: I shall not say that my new opponent's mistake "is enough to 
make* a devil blush;" but I may venture to affirm, that before he can 
prove the law of liberty is "a cobweb," he must not only burn St. James'
 Epistle, but sweep away the Epistles of St. Paul to the Romans and to 
the Galatians; together with the law, the prophets, and the Psalms. 
While he considers whether the tree of Antinomianism will yield a besom 
strong enough for that purpose, I beg leave to dwell a moment upon 
another of his mistakes. It respects obedience and good works, against 
which Solifidians indirectly wage an eternal war. It runs through 
several pages, but centers in the following unguarded propositions:-- 
Page 35, 1. 18. "Sincere obedience is no where mentioned in the Gospel 
as a condition of salvation;" and, (p. 36, 1. 4,) "Works have no share 
in the covenant of grace as a condition of life." I grant it, if by <i>salvation, </i>in the first proposition, and by <i>life </i>in the second, Mr. Berridge means <i>initial salvation, </i>and <i>life begun, </i>in the world of grace.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * How strangely may prejudice influence a good 
man! Mr. Berridge (page 164, &amp;c,) raises a masked battery against 
the article of the Minutes, where Mr. Wesley hints that the word merit 
might be used in a Scriptural sense to express what Dr. Owen, by an 
uncouth circumlocution, calls "the rewardable condecency, that our whole
 obedience, through God's gracious appointment, has unto eternal life." O
 sir," says Mr. Berridge, "God must abominate the pride, the insolence 
of human pride, which could dream of merit: it is enough to make a devil
 blush." There is great truth in these words, if Mr. Berridge speaks 
only of proper merit, or merit of condignness and equivalence; but if he
 extends them to the evangelical worthiness so frequently mentioned by 
our Lord--if he applies them to improper merit, generally called merit 
of congruity--he indirectly charges Christ with teaching a doctrine so 
excessively diabolical, that the devil himself would be ashamed of it: 
and what is more surprising still, if I mistake not, he indirectly 
enforces the dreadful heresy himself by an illustration, which, in some 
degree, shows how God rewards us "for" our works, and "according to" our
 works. "A tender-hearted gentleman," says he, "employs two labourers 
out of charity to weed a little spot of four square yards: both are old 
and much decrepit, but one is stronger than the other. The stronger 
weeds three yards, and receives three crowns; the weaker weedeth one, 
and receives one crown. Now both are rewarded for their labour, and 
according to their labour, but not for the merit of their labour." 
Granted, if merit is taken in the sense of proper merit, or merit of 
condignness and equivalence; but absolutely denied if it is taken in the
 sense of improper worthiness, or merit of congruity. Let Thomas 
Aquinas, the most famous of all the Papist divines, bring his standard 
of merit, and measure Mr. Berridge; and if the vicar of Everton (how 
loud soever he may exclaim against the word) is not found holding the 
doctrine of merit of congruity as much as Mr. Baxter, let me for ever 
forfeit all pretentions to a grain of common sense. "The angelic doctor"
 defines merit thus: <i>Dicitur aliquis mereri ex condigno, qua-itdo 
inrenitur equalitas inter pramium et meritum secundum estimationem.; ex 
congruo outer, tantum qu'indo talis 'squalitas non invenitur: sed solum 
secundum liberalitatem danlis munzis iribuitur quod dantem decet: </i>that
 is, "A man is said to merit with a merit of condignness, [i.e. to merit
 properly,] when, upon an average, there appears an equality between the
 reward and the merit. But he is said to merit only with a merit of 
congruity [i.e. to merit improperly] when there is no such equality; and
 when a benefactor, out of mere liberality, makes a present which it 
becomes him to make." Now, let candid man compare Mr. Berridge's <i>illustration </i>with
 the definition that the most renowned Papist doctor has given us of 
merit; and let them say if Mr. Berridge, instead of splitting the hair, 
does not maintain and illustrate the doctrine of merit of congruity: and
 if one of the blushes which he supposes our Lord's doctrine of 
worthiness, or merit, would bring upon the face of some modest devil, 
does not become the author of the "Christian World Unmasked," more than 
the author of the Minutes.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">For undoubtedly the "free gift is come upon all 
men to justification," or salvation from the damning guilt of original 
sin, and consequently to some interest in the Divine favour previous to 
all obedience and works. Again and again have I observed, that as "by 
one man's disobedience many <i>[oi </i>-oëëo', 'the multitudes of men,']
 were made sinners; so by the obedience of one, many [oi -oëëon, 'the 
multitudes of men,'] shall, [to the end of the world,] be made 
righteous," i.e. partakers of the above-mentioned justification, in 
consequence of Christ's atonement, and the talent of free grace, and 
supernatural light, which "enlightens every man that comes into the 
world;<i>" </i>compare Rom. v, 18, 19, with John i, 4, 5, 9. Far from 
opposing this initial life of free grace, this salvation unconditionally
 begun, I assert its necessity against the Pelagians, and its reality 
against the Papists and Calvinists, who agree to maintain that God has* 
absolutely reprobated a considerable part of mankind. But Mr. Berridge's
 propositions are Antinomianism unmasked, if he extends their meaning 
(as his scheme does) to finished salvation, and to a life of glory, 
unconditionally bestowed upon adulterous backsliders: for sincere 
obedience, or the good works of faith, are a condition, (or, to use Mr. 
Berridge's word, "a term,") indispensably required of all that stay long
 enough upon the stage of life to act as moral agents. "Every branch in 
me that beareth not fruit he taketh away," John xv, 2. "Be not deceived:
 neither fornicators, &amp;c, shall inherit the kingdom of God," I Cor. 
vi, 9: see Ezek. xviii, and xxxiii. "If the penitent thief had lived, 
(says our Church,) and not regarded the works of faith, he should have 
lost his salvation again.-- As for the argument taken from these words: 
"He that believeth <i>now </i>with the heart unto righteousness, hath 
everlasting life," (i.e. has a title to it, and a taste of a life of 
glory, and shall have the enjoyment of it, "if he continues in the faith
 rooted and grounded,") it is answered at large in the <i>Fourth Check, </i>p. 254.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ <i>*</i> Some of my readers will wonder at my 
coupling the Calvinists and the Romanists, when I speak of those who 
hold absolute reprobation; but my observation is founded upon matter of 
fact. We are too well acquainted with the opinion of the Calvinists 
concerning the vessels of wrath. The sentiments of the Papists not being
 so public, may be brought to light by the following anecdote:--' Being 
some years ago at Ganges, in the south of France, I went with Mr. 
Pomaret, the Protestant minister of that town, to recommend to Divine 
mercy the soul of a woman dying in child bed. When he came out of the 
house, he said: "Did you take notice of the person who was by the bed 
side? He is a man. midwife, and a strenuous Papist. You see by the 
consequences that this poor woman had a very hard labour. As it was 
doubtful whether the child would be born alive, he insisted upon 
baptizing it in the womb, <i>asecune seringue, </i>according to custom. 
The Protestant women in the room exclaimed against his intention of 
tormenting a woman in that extremity, by so ridiculous and needless an 
operation. 'Needless!' replied he, 'how can you call that needless, 
which will save a soul? Do you not know that if the child dies 
unbaptized it will certainly be lost?'" The doctrine of the Romish 
Church is, then, free wrath, or free reprobation, for the myriads of 
infants who die without baptism all the world over.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I beg leave to confirm this anecdote by a public 
testimony. My opponents have frequently mentioned the agreement of my 
sentiments with those of the Popish champion Bellarmine. This gave me a 
desire of looking into his works. Accordingly I procured them last 
winter; and, to my great surprise, before I had read a page, I found him
 a peculiar admirer of the great Predestinarian St. Augustine, whom he 
perpetually quotes. Nay, he is so strenuous an assertor of Calvinistic 
election, that, to prove "we can give no account of God's election on 
our part," among the reasons advanced by Calvin, Coles, Zanchius, 
&amp;c, in support of unconditional election and reprobation, he 
proposes the following argument:-- <i>Tertia ratio, 4.c, ducitur a 
parvulorum diversitate, quorum aliqui rapiuniur statim a baptismo, alii 
paulo ante baptismum, quorum priores ad gloriampra-destinatorum, 
posteriores ad punam reproborum pertinere non est dubium; nec possunt Mc
 ulla merita prenisa, ullusre bonus usus liberi arbitrii, outgratiangi."
 </i>(Bell. Opera de gratia et libero arbitrio. Cap. v, Antverpin, 1611,
 p. 766.) That is, "The third reason is taken from the different lot of 
little children; some being snatched immediately after baptism, and 
others a little before baptism: the former of whom undoubtedly go to the
 glory of the elect; and the latter to the punishment of the reprobates.
 Nor can any desert foreseen, or any good use of free will, or of grace,
 be here pretended." This argument is truly worthy of the cause which it
 supports. The very essence of Calvinism is an irreconcilable opposition
 to the second Gospel axiom. And as Bellarmine's argument demolishes 
that axiom, (it being impossible that the damnation of reprobated 
infants should be from themselves,) he necessarily builds up Calvinism, 
with all its gracious doctrines. I might here return my last opponent 
these words of his "Finishing Stroke," (p. 15,) which he writes in 
capitals, "So BELLARMINE." "See, sir, what company you are again, found 
in!" But I do not admire such arguments. Were father Walsh and Cardinal 
Bellarmine in the right, it would be no more disgrace to Mr. Hill to 
stand between them both, than it is to me to believe, with the cardinal,
 that Christ has said, "In the day of judgment, by thy words thou shalt 
be justified:" for, as a diamond does not become a pebble upon the 
finger of a Papist, so truth does not become a lie under his pen.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 38, Mr. Berridge unmasks Antinomianism in the
 following proposition:--" I have gathered up my ends, respecting this 
matter; and I trust you see, at length, that sincere obedience is 
nothing but a Jack o'lantern, dancing here and there and every where: no
 man could ever catch him, but thousands have been lost by following 
him."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">If I mistake not, Mr. Berridge here exceeds Mr. Hill. The author of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis </i>only
 supposes that works have nothing to do before the Judge of all the 
earth in the matter of our eternal salvation, and that all believers 
shall "sing louder" in heaven for all their crimes upon earth: but the 
Vicar of Everton represents <i>sincere obedience </i>(which is a collection of all the good works of upright heathens, Jews, and Christians,) as "a <i>Jack o'lantern; </i>and
 thousands," says be, "have been lost by following him." Here is a blow 
at the root! What! thousands lost by following after sincere obedience 
to God's commands! Impossible! Our pious author, I hope, means insincere
 obedience; but if he stands to what he has written, he must not be 
surprised, if, with the "good folks cast in a Gospel foundry, I ring a 
dire bell," and warn the Protestant world against so capital a mistake. 
That thousands have been lost by resting in faithless, superficial, 
hypocritical, insincere obedience, I grant: but thousands! lost! by 
following after sincere obedience, i.e. after the obedience we uprightly
 perform according to the light we have! This is as impossible as that 
the Holy Spirit should lie when he testifies, "In every nation, he that 
feareth God and worketh righteousness, is accepted of him;<i>" </i>according to one or another of the Divine dispensations: he is accepted as a converted heathen, Jew, or Christian.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Had I the voice of a trumpet, I would shout upon 
the walls of our Jerusalem: "Let no man deceive you:" nobody was ever 
lost, but for not following after, or for starting from sincere 
obedience; Christian faith itself being nothing but sincere obedience to
 this grand Gospel precept: "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou 
shalt be saved." "We have received apostleship," says St. Paul, "for 
obedience to the faith among all nations," Rom. i, 5. No adult children 
of Adam were ever eternally saved, but such as followed after sincere 
obedience, at least from the time of their last conversion, if they once
 drew back toward perdition. For "Christ," says the apostle, "is the 
author of eternal salvation to them that obey him;<i>" </i>and he 
undoubtedly means, that obey him sincerely. "He will render eternal life
 to them who by patient continuance in well doing," or by persevering in
 sincere obedience, "seek for glory." "Has the Lord as great delight in 
burnt offerings," says Samuel, "as in obeying [and I dare say he meant 
sincerely obeying] the voice of the Lord? Behold! [whatever Solifidians 
may say] to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat 
of rams: for rebellion [or disobedience] is as the sin of witchcraft, 
and stubbornness as idolatry," Heb. v, 9; Rom. ii, 7; 1 Sam. xv, 22.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">God, to show the high value he puts upon sincere 
obedience, sent Jeremiah to the Rechabites with this message: "Thus 
saith the Lord of hosts, Because ye have obeyed the commandment of 
Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts; therefore Jonadab the 
son of Rechal shall not want a man to stand before me for ever." His 
capital charge against Israel is that of disobedience. St. Peter, who 
observes that the believing Jews had purified their souls by obeying the
 truth, asks, "What shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel?<i>" </i>And
 St. Paul answers, that" Christ will come in flaming fire, taking 
vengeance on them,"--and that "God will render tribulation and wrath to 
them that do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness:<i>" </i>and 
even that famous passage, "He that believeth on the Son, hath 
everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see 
life," John iii, 36, is in the original a rampart against Solifidianism;
 for in the last sentence of it, the word rendered "believeth not," is 
not [ou -nòåuùí], in opposition to the first clause; but [áç-å'-ùí], an 
expression which, by signifying equally "he who disobeyeth," and "he who
 believeth not," guards the doctrine of obedience as strongly as that of
 faith.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION III. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>Answer to Mr. Berridge's capital arguments against sincere obedience.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">THE serious reader probably wonders at the pious 
vicar of Everton and asks, if he supports his assertions against sincere
 obedience by arguments? Yes, he does, and some of them are so plausible
 that the simple can hardly avoid being deceived by them; flay, and some
 of the judicious too: for asking, last summer, a sensible clergyman 
what part of Mr. Berridge's book he admired most, he convinced me of the
 seasonableness of this publication, by replying, 'I think him most 
excellent upon sincere obedience." A glaring proof this, that the 
impossibility of deceiving the very elect is not absolute, and that our 
Lord did not give them an impertinent caution, when he said, "Take heed 
that no man deceive you." But let us hear Mr. Berridge:--  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 24. "Perhaps you think that (Christ came to 
shorten man's duty, and make it more feasible by shoving a commandment 
out of Moses' tables, as the Papists have done; or by clipping and 
paring all the commandments, as the moralists do. Thus sincere 
obedience, instead of perfect, is now considered as the law of works. 
But if Jesus Christ came to shorten man's duty, he came to give us a 
license to sin. For duty cannot be shortened without breaking 
commandments. And thus Christ becomes a minister of sin with a witness, 
and must be ranked at the head of Antinomian preachers." To this 
specious argument I reply:--  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">(1.) After the fall, Christ was given in the 
promise to mankind as a Mediator; and "help was laid upon him" to make 
man's duty (as a redeemed sinner) feasible. To deny it, is to deny man's
 redemption. At that first promulgation of the Gospel, what St. Paul 
calls "the law of faith," and St. James, "the law of liberty," took 
place. This gracious law has been in force under all the dispensations 
of the everlasting Gospel ever since. And according to its tenor, in the
 day of judgment, we shall "be justified or condemned," Matt. xii, 37. 
(2.) To assert that "the law of liberty," or "the law of faith," 
requires of us paradisiacal innocence, and such a perfection of bodily 
and rational powers as Adam had before the fall, is to set Christ's 
mediation aside: and to. suppose that it leaves us just where it found 
us, that is, under the old Adamic covenant. (3.) "The law of liberty" 
"neither shoves out, pares, nor clips" any moral commandment; for it 
condemns a man for the adultery of the eye, as well as for gross 
fornication; and for the murder of the, tongue or heart, as well as for 
manual assassination; and it requires us to "love God with all our 
heart, and our neighbour as ourselves," according to the light of our 
dispensation, and the talent of power we have received from above. He 
that "keeps this whole law, and breaks it in one point," (as Saul did in
 the matter of Agag David in the matter of Uriah, Judas in the matter of
 Mammon, some Corinthians and Galatians in biting one another, and some 
of the Christians, to whom St. James wrote, in despising the poor, and 
showing a mean partiality to the rich,) he, I say, that knowingly and 
willfully "breaks this law in one point, is guilty of all;<i>" </i>and 
he remains I under the curse of it, till he has repented, and resumed 
the obedience of faith. Therefore, when our Lord substituted the law of 
liberty for the law of innocence, he neither "gave us a license to sin,"
 nor came a minister of sin with a witness," as Mr. Berridge rashly 
affirms. (4.) The fourth Mosaic commandment allows "no manner of work," 
but the last edition of the law of liberty allows all manner of works of
 necessity and mercy to be done on the Sabbath. Our Lord, therefore, 
dispenses with the uncommon rigor with which the Jews observed the 
sacred day: and if Mr. Berridge will call that indulgence "clipping, 
paring," or altering the fourth commandment, he is at liberty; but if we
 break a commandment in availing ourselves of our Lord's gracious 
dispensation, why does Mr. Berridge allow his man servant, his maid 
servant, or his horse to work on the Saturday? Why does he not keep the 
seventh day holy, "like the circumcised race?<i>"</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">(5.) Innocent man, with unimpaired powers, could 
yield perfect obedience to the law of innocence; therefore that law made
 no allowance, no provision, for any deficiency in duty. Not so "the law
 of liberty;<i>" </i>for although it allows no willful sin, yet it does 
not reject sprinkled, though as yet imperfect, obedience. Nor does it, 
as some divines would persuade the world, curse the bud because it is 
not yet the blossom, nor the blossom because it is not yet the fruit, 
nor the fruit because it is not yet ripe; provided it tends to maturity,
 and harbors not insincerity, the worm that destroys evangelical 
obedience. It declares that our works of faith are accepted according to
 what we have, and not according to what we have not. It graciously 
receives from a heathen the obedience of - heathen, and from a babe in 
Christ the obedience of a babe: and instead of sentencing to hell the 
man, whose pound has only gained five pounds, and in whom the seed of 
the word has only produced thirty fold, it kindly allows him half the 
reward of him whose pound has gained ten pounds, or in whom the seed has
 brought forth sixty fold. But it shows no mercy to the unprofitable 
servant, who buries his talent; and it threatens with sorer punishment 
the wicked servant who "turns the grace of God into lasciviousness."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">(6.) "Thus sincere obedience is now considered as 
the law of works." Not so: but it is considered, even by judicious 
Calvinists, as that obedience which the law of liberty accepts of, by 
which it is fulfilled, amid through which believers shall be justified 
in the great day. I might fill a volume with quotations from their 
writings; but three or four will sufficiently prove my assertion. Joseph
 Alleine, that zealous and successful preacher, says, in his <i>Sure Guide to Heaven, </i>or <i>Alarm to the Unconverted, </i>Lond.
 1705, (pp. 153, 154,) "The terms of mercy," (he should have said,) "The
 terms of eternal salvation are brought as low as possible to you. God 
has stooped as low to sinners as with honour he can. He will not be 
thought a father of sin, nor stain the glory of his holiness; and 
whither could he come lower than he hath, unless he should do this? He 
has abated the impossible terms of the first covenant, Acts xvi, 31; 
[Croí.] xxviii, 13. He does not impose any thing unreasonable or 
impossible, as a condition of life." Alleine should have said, <i>as a condition of eternal life in glory; </i>for God in Christ most freely gives us <i>an initial Day </i>of <i>grace </i>before he puts us upon performing any terms, in order to an <i>eternal life of glory. </i>"Two
 things were necessary to be done by you according to the first 
covenant, &amp;c. And for future obedience, here he is content to yield 
to your weakness arid remit the rigor. He does not stand upon [legal 
perfection, &amp;c, but is content to accept of sincerity," Gen. xvii, 
ii.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Matthew Mead, in his treatise on <i>The Good of Early Obedience, </i>London,
 1683, (p. 402,) says: "It must be an upright and sincere obedience. 
'Walk before me, and be thou perfect,' Gen. xvii, N. In the margin it is
 <i>sincere </i>or <i>upright. </i>So that sincerity and uprightness is 
new covenant perfection. The perfection of grace in heaven is glory; but
 the perfection of grace on earth is sincerity" Mr. Henry perfectly 
agrees with Mr. Mead when he thus comments upon Gen. vi, 9: "Noah was a 
just man and perfect:' he was perfect, not with a sinless perfection, 
(according to the first covenant,) but a perfection of sincerity. And it
 is well for us, that, by virtue of the covenant of grace, upon the 
score of Christ's righteousness, sincerity is accepted as our Gospel 
perfection!" Hence it is that Dr. Owen says, a believer as such shall be
 tried, judged, and justified "by his own personal sincere obedience." <i>(Of Justification, </i>p.
 111.) By comparing these fair quotations with Mr. Berridge's argument, 
my reader, without having the sagacity of "an old fox," will see that 
Antinomianism has lost all decency in our days, and is not ashamed to 
call "Jack o'lantern," &amp;c, what the sober Calvinists of the last 
century called Gospel perfection.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Lastly: to insinuate, as Mr. Berridge does, that 
"Christ becomes a minister of sin with a witness, and must be Ranked at 
the head of the Antinomian preachers," because he has substituted the 
law of liberty for the old Adamic covenant, is something so ungrateful 
in a believer, so astonishing in a Gospel minister, that--but I spare 
the pious vicar of Everton, and rise against thee, O Crispianity! Thou 
hast seduced that man of God, and upon thee I charge his dreadful 
mistake. However, he will permit me to conclude this answer to his 
shrewd argument by the following query:--If Christ becomes a minister of
 sin, and must be ranked at the head of Antinomian preachers," for 
placing us under the law of liberty, which curses a fallen believer that
 breaks it in one point, (though it should be only by secretly harboring
 malice or lust in his heart,) what must we say of the divines, who give
 us to understand that believers are not under the law preached by St. 
James, but under directions, or "rules of life," which they may break 
unto adultery and murder, without ceasing to be God's pleasant children,
 and men after his own heart? Must these popular men be ranked at the 
head, or at the tail of the Antinomian preachers?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 24. Mr. Berridge advances another argument: 
"If sincere obedience means nay thing, it must signify either doing what
 you can, or doing what you will." I apprehend it means neither the one 
nor the other, but doing with uprightness what we know God requires of 
us, according to the dispensation of grace which we are under; meekly 
lamenting our deficiencies, and aspiring at doing all better and better 
every day. "So we are [not] got upon the old swampy ground again," but 
stand upon the Rock of Ages, and there defend the law of liberty against
 mistaken Solifidians.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 27. Mr. Berridge, instead of showing that our
 obedience is insincere, if we live in sin, and despise Christ's 
salvation, goes on mowing down all sincere obedience without 
distinction. "I perceive," says he, "you are not yet disposed to 
renounce sincere obedience." And, to engage us to it, he advances 
another argument, which, if it were sound, would demolish, not only 
"sincere obedience," but true repentance, faith unfeigned, and all 
Christianity. To answer it, therefore, I only need to produce it; 
substituting the words true repentance, or faith unfeigned, for "sincere
 obedience," which Mr. Berridge ridicules, thus:--  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"You might have reason to complain, if God had 
made sincere obedience, [I say, true repentance, or faith unfeigned,] a 
condition of salvation. Much talk of it there is, like the good man in 
the moon, yet none could ever ken it. I dare defy the scribes to tell me
 truly what sincere [repentance] is: whether it means [leaving] half my <i>sins, </i>or
 one fiftieth, or only hundredth part; [shedding] half [a score of 
tears,] 'or fifty, or one hundred. I dare defy all the lawyers in the 
world to tell me, whether [faith unfeigned,] means [believing] half [the
 Bible,] or three quarters, or one quarter, or one fiftieth, or one 
hundredth part: or whether it means [believing with*] half [a grain of 
the faith which removes a mountain load of guilt,] or one fiftieth, or 
one hundredth part [of a grain: or whether it implies believing with all
 our hearts, or with] half, or three quarters, or one quarter, &amp;c. 
Where must we draw the line? It surely needs a magic wand to draw it." 
(See p. 27, &amp;c.)  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * Mr. Berridge invites me thus to retort his bad
 argument against sincere obedience, (p. 94, 1. 18:) "I have been 
praying fifteen years for faith with some earnestness, and am not yet 
possessed of more than half a grain. Jesus assures you that a single 
grain, &amp;c, would remove a mountain load of guilt from the 
conscience," &amp;c.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Mr. Berridge turns his flaming argument against 
sincere obedience, like the cherub's sword, "every way." Take two more 
instances of his skill: still giving me leave to level at faith 
unfeigned "the total term of all salvation," what he says against 
sincere obedience. Page 28: "If God has made sincere obedience [I 
retort, faith unfeigned] the condition [or term] of salvation, he would 
certainly have drawn the line, and marked out the boundary precisely, 
because our life depended on it." Page 28: "Sincere obedience [I 
continue to say, faith unfeigned] is called a condition, [or a term,] 
and no one knows what it is, &amp;c. O fine condition! Surely Satan was 
the author of it."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Page 24. "It is Satan's catch word for the 
Gospel." Page 38. It is "nothing but a Jack o'lantern, dancing here and 
there and every where," &amp;c. For, (p. 29,) "If God has drawn no 
boundary, man must draw it, and will draw it where he pleaseth. Sincere 
obedience [I still retort, <i>sincere </i>repentance, or true faith] 
thus becomes a nose of wax, and is so fingered as to fit exactly every 
human face. I look upon this doctrine as the devil's masterpiece," 
&amp;c.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">And I look upon these assertions as the 
masterpiece of Antinomian rashness, and Geneva logic in the mouth of the
 pious vicar of Everton. Is it not surprising, that he who <i>unmasks the Christian World </i>should be so hood-winked by Calvinism, as not to see that there are as many false professors of <i>sincere repentance </i>and <i>true faith, </i>as there are of <i>sincere obedience; </i>that
 even the Turks call themselves Mussulmen, or true believers; and that 
he has full as much reason to call sincere repentance, or true faith, "a
 rotten buttress, a nose of wax, a paper kite, a Jack o'lantern," 
&amp;c, as sincere obedience?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">What a touch has this learned divine given here to
 the ark of God, in order to prop up that of Calvin? And how happy is it
 for religion, that this grand argument against obedience, repentance, 
and faith, is founded upon a hypothetical proposition, (p. 29, 1. 8,) 
"If God has drawn no boundary!" This supposition Mr. B. takes for 
granted, though it is evidently false; the boundaries of sincere 
obedience being full as clearly drawn in the Scriptures, as those of 
true repentance, and faith unfeigned.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">God himself, without "a magic wand," has "drawn 
the line," both m every man's conscience, and in his written word. The 
line of Jewish obedience is drawn all over the Old Testament, especially
 Exod. xx; Psa. xv; Ezek. xviii, and Mic. vi, 8. The line of Christian 
obedience is exactly drawn all over the New Testament, and most 
particularly in our Lord's sermon on the mount. And the line of heathen 
faith and obedience is, without the Scripture, drawn in every breast by 
the gracious "light that enlightens every man who comes into the world."
 Through this light even Mohammedans and heathens may "believe that I 
God is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him;" and
 by this faith they may "work righteousness," do to others as they would
 be done by, and so "fulfill the law of liberty," according to their 
dispensation. And that some do is evident from these words of the 
apostle: "When the Gentiles, who have not the [written] law, do by 
nature [in its present state of initial restoration, without any other 
assistance than that which Divine grace vouchsafes to all men 
universally] the things contained in the law: these having no [written] 
law are a law unto themselves, and show the work [or precepts] of the 
law written in their hearts; their conscience also bearing witness, and 
their thoughts accusing or excusing one another," Rom. ii, 14, 15. 
Therefore the dreadful blow inadvertently struck at all religion, 
through the side of sincere obedience, is happily given with a broken 
reed. Christianity stands. The important term of sincere obedience, with
 respect to adult persons, has not Satan, but God for its author; and 
Antinomianism is more and more "unmasked."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But these are not all Mr. Berridge's objections 
against sincere obedience: for (p. 30) he says, "If works are a 
condition in the Gospel covenant, then works must make the whole of it."
 Why so? May not faith and repentance, so long as they continue true and
 lively, produce good works, their proper fruit? Why must the fruit 
"make the whole" of the tree? Beside, works being the evidencing cause 
of our salvation according to the Gospel, you have no warrant from 
Scripture to say, they must make the whole cause of it. They agree 
extremely well with faith, the instrumental cause; with Christ's blood, 
the properly meritorious cause; and with God's mercy, the first moving 
cause. May I not affirm, that the motion of the fourth wheel of a clock 
is absolutely necessary to its pointing the hour, without supposing that
 such a wheel must make the whole of the wheel work? O how have the lean
 kine, ascending out of the lake of Geneva, eaten those that fed so long
 near the river Cam!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">But you add, (p. 30,) "Sincere obedience, as a 
condition, will lead you unavoidably up to perfect obedience." And 
suppose it should, pray, where would be the misfortune? Is it right to 
frighten the Christian world from sincere obedience, by holding out to 
their view Christian perfection, as if it were Medusa's fearful head-?- 
Are we not commanded to "go on to perfection?" Was not this one of our 
Lord's complaints against the Church of Sardis: "I have not found thy 
works perfect before God?" Does not St. Paul sum up all the law, or all 
obedience, in love? And does not St. John make honourable mention of 
perfect love, and excite those who are "not made perfect in love to have
 fellowship with him;" and with those who could say, "Our love is made 
perfect?" I John iv, 17. Why then should the world be driven from 
sincere, by the fear of perfect, obedience? Especially as our Lord never
 required absolute perfection from archangels, much less from fallen 
man. The perfection which he kindly calls us to being nothing but a 
faithful improvement of our talents, according to the proportion of the 
grace given us, and the standard of the dispensation we are under. So 
that, upon this footing, he whose one talent gains another, obeys as 
perfectly in his degree as he whose five talents gain five more. 
Notwithstanding all the insinuations of those "fishers of men," who beat
 the streams of truth to drive the fishes from Christian perfection into
 the Antinomian net, God is not an austere master, much less a foolish 
One, lie does not expect to reap where he has not sown; or to reap wheat
 where he sows only barley. Those gracious words of our Lord, repeated 
four times in the Gospel, might alone silence them that discourage 
believers from going on to the perfection of' obedience peculiar to 
their dispensation: "To every one that hath <i>to purpose </i>shall be 
given, and he shall have abundance," he shall attain the perfection of 
his dispensation; "but from him that bath not," because he buries his 
talent under pretence that his Lord requires unattainable obedience, 
"shall be taken away even that which he hath." Compare Matt. xiii, 12, 
with Matt. xxv, 29; Mark iv, 24, and Luke viii, 15.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The two last arguments of Mr. Berridge against 
sincere obedience may be retorted thus:--(i.) If faith is a condition 
(or term) in the Gospel covenant, then faith must make the whole of it. 
But if this be true, what becomes of Christ's obedience unto death? You 
reply, Faith necessarily supposes it. But you cannot escape. I follow 
you step by step, and say, The works I plead for necessarily suppose not
 only our Lord's obedience unto death, hut faith, which you call "the 
only term of all salvation." (2.) You say, "Sincere obedience, as a 
condition, will lead you unavoidably up to perfect obedience." And I 
retort: faith unfeigned, as a term or condition, will lead you 
unavoidably up to perfect faith: for if "the law of liberty" commands us
 to love God "with all our soul," it charges us also to believe in 
Christ "with all our heart," Acts viii, 37. Should you reply, I am not 
afraid of being led up to perfect faith: I return the same answer with 
regard to perfect obedience.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">This argument against sincere obedience, taken 
from the danger of going on to the perfection of it, is so much the more
 extraordinary, when dropping from Mr. Berridge's pen, as it is 
demolished by the words of his mouth, when he sings:--  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Thee we would be always blessing, </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Serve thee as thine hosts above, </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Pray and praise thee without ceasing, </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Glory in thy perfect love. </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4"> </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Finish then thy new creation; </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Pure and spotless may we be! </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Triumph in thy full salvation, </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Perfectly restor'd by thee! </font>
</p><p><font size="4">See <i>A</i> <i>Collection of Divine Songs, by J. Berridge, M. A</i>. &amp;c, p. 178.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">To conclude. Another argument is often urged <i>by </i>this
 pious author to render the doctrine of a believer's final justification
 by the evidence of works odious to humble souls, lie takes it for 
granted that it encourages boasting; still confounding the works of 
faith, which he at times recommends as well as I, with the Pharisaical 
works of unbelief, which I perpetually decry as well as he. But even 
this argument, about which the Calvinists make so much noise, may be 
retorted thus: There is as much danger of being proud of one's faith, as
 of one's works of faith. And if Mr. Berridge presses me with Rom. iii, 
27, "Boasting is excluded by the law of faith:<i>" </i>I reply, that the
 works I plead for being the works of faith, his argument makes as much 
for me as for him: and I press him in my turn with Rom. xi, 18, 20, 
"Boast not thyself against the branches. Thou standest by faith. Be not 
high minded, but fear:<i>" </i>which shows it is as possible to be proud
 of faith, as of the works of faith. Nor can a believer boast of the 
latter, unless his humble faith begins to degenerate into vain fancy.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Such are the capital objections that Mr. Berridge,
 in his unguarded zeal for the first Gospel axiom, has advanced against 
the second. Should he attempt to exculpate himself by saying, that all 
his arguments against sincere obedience are leveled at the hypocritical 
obedience which Pharisaic boasters sometimes call sincere: I reply, (N.)
 It is a pity he never once told his readers so. (2.) It is surprising 
that he who <i>unmasks the Christian World, </i>should so mask himself, 
as to say just the reverse of what he means. (3.) If he really designs 
to attack insincere obedience, why does he not attack it as insincere? 
And why does he advance no arguments against it, but such as would give 
the deepest wound to truly sincere obedience, if they were conclusive? 
(4.) What would Mr. Berridge say of me, if I published an impious essay 
against Divine worship in general, and, to vindicate my own conduct, 
gave it out, some months after, that I only meant to attack "the worship
 of the host," which makes a part of what the Papists call "Divine 
worship?" Would so lame an excuse clear me before the unprejudiced 
world? But, (5.) The worst is, that if Calvinism is true, all Mr. 
Berridge's arguments are as conclusive against evangelical, sincere 
obedience, as against the hypocritical works of Pharisees: for, if 
Christians (who have time to add the works chiefly recommended by St. 
James to the faith chiefly preached by St. Paul,) have a full, 
inamissible title to final justification without those works, flay, with
 the most horrid works, such as adultery and murder; is it not evident 
that the passport of good works and sincere obedience is as needless to 
their eternal salvation as "a rotten buttress, a paper kite, or a Jack 
o'lantern?"  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION IV. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>When Mr. Berridge grants "that our damnation is
 wholly from ourselves," he grants that our salvation is suspended upon 
some term, which through grace we have power to fulfill; and in this 
case, unconditional reprobation, absolute election, and finished 
salvation, are false doctrines: and Calvin's whole system stands upon a 
sandy foundation.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">WHEN a man grants me <i>two and two, </i>he grants me <i>four; </i>he
 cannot help it. If he exclaims against me for drawing the necessary 
inference, he only exposes himself before men of sense. Mr. Berridge, 
(p. 190,) fully grants the second Gospel axiom: "Our damnation," says 
he, "is wholly from ourselves." Nevertheless, he declares, (p. 26,) that
 there is "an absolute impossibility of being justified [or saved] in 
any manner by our works;" and part of his book seems leveled at this 
proposition of the Minutes, "Salvation, not by the merit of works, but 
by works as a condition." Now, if I am not mistaken, by granting the 
above-mentioned Gospel axiom, as all moderate Calvinists do, he grants 
me Mr. Wesley's proposition, together with the demolition of Calvinism. 
For,  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">1. If my damnation is wholly from myself,* it is 
not the necessary consequence of an absolute, efficacious decree of 
non-election, for then my damnation would be wholly from God. Nor is it 
the necessary consequence of the devil's temptation, for then it would 
be from the devil. Nor is it (upon the Gospel plan) the necessary 
consequence of Adam's fall: because, although I fell seminally into a 
state of damnation in the loins of Adam, yet the free gift came 
seminally upon me as well as upon all men unto initial justification; 
for I was no less in Adam when God raised him up by the true promise of a
 Mediator, than when he fell by the lying promise of the tempter.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * By the word <i>wholly, </i>Mr. Berridge cannot
 mean that our damnation may not have secondary causes--such as a 
tempting devil, an alluring world, wicked company, a bad book, &amp;c. 
He is too wise to deny it. All I suppose he means, as well as myself, 
is, that every reprobate is the primary, meritorious cause of his 
damnation. Just as Divine grace in Christ is the primary, meritorious 
cause of our salvation; although under that original, principal leading 
cause, there are inferior, instrumental, evidencing causes--such as 
Bibles, ministers, religious conversation, faith, good works. &amp;c.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Now, if my damnation is neither from any 
unconditional decree of reprobation, nor from the fall of Adam, what 
becomes of Apollo and his sister, the great Diana What becomes of 
absolute reprobation, and its inseparable companion, unconditional 
election? What becomes of all the horrors that St. Paul is supposed to 
father upon the God of love, Rom. ix? In a word, what becomes of 
Calvinism?  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Again: If" my damnation is wholly from myself," 
the just Judge of all the earth must damn me personally for something 
which he had put it in my power personally to do or to leave undone. My 
damnation, then, and consequently my salvation, is necessarily suspended
 on some term or condition, the performance or non-performance of which 
is <i>at </i>my option. Nor is light more contrary to darkness than 
these two propositions of Mr. Berridge are to each other, "Our damnation
 is wholly from ourselves:" and, "St. Paul plainly shuts out all works 
of sincere obedience as a condition" of eternal salvation. On the first 
stand the Minutes and the Checks: on the second, Calvinism and 
Antinomianism. And as some of Mr. Berridge's readers cannot receive two 
incompatible propositions, they desire to know which of them we must 
give to the winds, with the paper kite of sincere obedience.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">I hope that gentleman will not endeavour to screen
 Calvinism by saying, that the reprobates are damned merely for their 
personal sins, and therefore "their damnation is wholly from 
themselves." An illustration will easily show the fallacy of this 
argument, by which Calvinism is frequently kept in countenance.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">A monarch, in whose dominions all children are naturally born <i>lame, </i>makes a law, that all who shall not walk <i>straight </i>before
 a certain day shall be cast into a fiery furnace. The terrible day 
comes, and myriads of lame culprits stand before him. His anger smokes 
against them; and with a stretched-out arm he thunders, Depart from me, 
ye cursed, into that place of torment prepared for obstinate offenders; 
for when I bid you walk upright, ye persisted to go lame. Go, burn to 
all eternity, and, as ye burn, clear my justice; and remember, that 
"your misery is wholly from yourselves."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Wholly from ourselves!" they reply with one 
voice: "Was it ever in our power not to be born lame; or to walk upright
 in our crippled condition? Wast not thou acquainted with our natural 
misfortune? When a wonderful man came into thy kingdom to heal the lame,
 didst thou not order that he should pass us by? If he and his servants 
have tantalized us with general offers of a free cure, dost thou not 
know they were complimental, lying offers? 'last thou forgotten, how 
thou orderedst the loving physician, who wept over us, never to prepare 
one drop of his purple tincture for us? And how thy 'secret will' bound 
us with the invisible chains of an efficacious decree of preterition, 
that we might never come at that precious remedy? I In a word, was it 
not from the beginning thy fixed determination, that, as we were born 
lame and helpless subjects to thy crown, so we should remain the lame 
and remediless victims of thy wrath? If therefore thou wilt show the 
boundless extent of thy grim sovereignty, by casting us into that 
flaming abyss, do it; for we cannot resist thee! But do not pretend that
 we have pulled down thy wrath upon us. Rob, O rob us not of the only 
alleviation that our deplorable case can admit of, viz. the comfort of 
thinking that our destruction is not from ourselves. If thou wilt be 
fierce as a lion, at least be not hypocritical as a crocodile."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">"Hear, ye heavens," replies the absolute monarch, 
"give ear, O earth, and judge of the justice of my proceedings in just 
these lame culprits. In consequence of a permissive, efficacious decree 
of mine, five or six thousand years ago, one of their ancestors brought 
lameness upon himself and upon them: therefore their necessary lameness,
 and the fearful destruction with which I am going to punish their lame 
steps, are wholly from themselves. Are not my ways equal, and theirs 
unequal? And far from being a crocodile toward them, am I not a lamb in 
whose mouth is no guile? or at least a lion who, like that of the tribe 
of Judah, use my sovereign power only according to the clearest dictates
 of justice and equity?" "Out of thine own mouth," reply the wretched 
culprits, "the world of rational beings will condemn thee, thou true 
king of terrors! Thou acknowledgest that thousands of years before we 
were born, one of our ancestors brought upon us the necessary lameness, 
in consequence of which we must he cast into that fiery furnace, without
 having ever had it in our power to take one straight step; and yet thou
 sayest that our destruction is wholly from ourselves! If thou wert not 
lost to all sense of equity and regard for truth, thou wouldst say that 
our condemnation is hot from ourselves, but wholly from a man whom most 
of us never heard of; unless thou wast the grand contriver of the fall, 
which brought on his lameness and ours; and in that case our destruction
 is far less from him than from thyself. Beside, thou hast published a 
decree, in which thou declarest, 'They shall say no more, The fathers 
have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge; but 
every one shall die for his own iniquity. Behold, all souls are mine, as
 the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul 
that sinneth it shall die' the death thou designest us. Now iniquity 
that we could never personally help, an iniquity caused by one of our 
ancestors can never be our own iniquity, contradistinguished from that 
of our fathers. If thou didst cast all the asses of thy kingdom into thy
 fiery furnace, because they do not bray as melodiously as the 
nightingale sings; or all the ravens, because they are not as white as 
swans; couldst thou with any truth say, ' Their torments <i>are wholly from themselves?</i>'
 And hast thou any more reason to say that our perdition is from 
ourselves, when thou burnest us merely for our natural, necessary 
lameness, and for the lame steps that it has naturally and necessarily 
occasioned?"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The judicious reader will enter into this 
illustration without being presented with a key of my own making; and, 
trusting his candour and good sense with that business, I draw the 
following inferences from the second Gospel axiom, which Mr. Berridge 
has explicitly granted. (1.) God does not prevaricate, but speaks a 
melancholy truth, when he says, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself."
 (2.) Every reprobate is his own destroyer, not only because he has 
willfully sinned away the justification mentioned Rom. v, 18, by which 
all infants are entitled to the kingdom of heaven, but also because he 
willfully rejects the salvation really prepared for, and sincerely 
offered to him in Christ. (3.) According to the second covenant, we are 
never in a state of personal damnation till we have personally buried 
the talent of that "grace which bringeth salvation, and hath apparent to
 all men." (4.) Calvinism, which teaches the reprobates fully to 
exculpate themselves, and justly to charge God with shuffling, lying, 
injustice, cruelty, and hypocrisy, is a system that does the reprobates 
infinite honour, and the Divine perfections unspeakable injury. And, 
(5.) When Mr. Berridge maintains that "our damnation is wholly from 
ourselves," he maintains indirectly that the Minutes and Checks, which 
necessarily stand or fall with that Gospel axiom, are truly Scriptural. 
Thus, like other pious Calvinists,* he gives us an excellent dose of 
antidote to expel Antinomian poison. But who shall recommend it to the 
Calvinistic world? Mr. Wesley they will not hear. My Checks they will 
not read. Go, then, "valiant Sergeant IF." Thou comest from Everton, 
therefore thou shalt be welcome. Thou knowest the way to the closets of 
Solifidians: nay, thou art there already with" <i>The Christian World Unmasked."</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * The warm author of a pamphlet, entitled, "Dr. 
Crisp's Ghost, or a Check upon Checks, being a Bridle for Antinomian, 
and a Whip for Pelagian and Arminian Methodists," with this motto, 
"Without are dogs, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie;" designed, it 
seems, to whip the Arisimian dogs, and to prove that Flavel, Baxter, 
Williams, and I, make a lie, when we represent Dr. Crisp as an abettor 
of "Antinomian dotages." This warm author, I say, informs us, that even 
Dr. Crisp, overcome by the glaring evidence of truth, once said, "I must
 read the fearful doom of all who have not learned this lesson [denying 
ungodliness,] and are not yet taught it of God, &amp;c. They are yet in 
the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity, and have not their 
part in this matter. I say, as yet, this is their fearful doom; and if 
they continue thus untaught their lesson, there can be no salvation by 
grace for them. 'Not every one that says, Lord, Lord, shall enter the 
kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in 
heaven,' &amp;c. Some licentious, ungodly wretches I know reply, though 
to their own ruin, &amp;c, that Christ justifies the ungodly, and we are
 saved by faith without works. But, alas! they observe not how cunningly
 the devil equivocates to lull them asleep in their ungodly practices. 
It is true indeed that Christ justifies the ungodly; that is, he finds 
them ungodly when he imputes his righteousness to them: but he does not 
leave them ungodly after he has inspired them; he teacheth them to deny 
ungodliness. He affords no cloak to persevering in ungodliness; but will
 come in naming fire, with his mighty angels, to render vengeance unto 
such. He that denies not ungodliness, him will Christ deny before his 
Father which is in heaven. Why, then, wilt thou be deluded with gross 
sophistry in so clear a sunshine of the Gospel? Is not the light so 
bright that thine own heart checks thee? And if thine heart condemns 
thee, God is greater, and searches all things."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Hail Crisp. Far from checking my Checks, and 
whipping the Arminian dog, in a happy moment thou manfully fightest St. 
James' battle. Thou callest the doctrine of the Checks "sunshine;" and 
whippest thine own speculative error out of the Church as "gross 
sophistry"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Dr. Crisp (as quoted by his opponent,) almost 
discovered once the important difference between the salvation of a 
sinner previous to works; and the salvation of a believer consequent 
upon works.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">His excellent words run thus: "It is true, also, 
we are saved by faith without works; but here also Satan equivocates as 
grossly as in the other ease: for though faith only saves without works 
efficiently, yet not consequentially, as I said before; that is, though 
faith only saves, yet that faith must not be alone that saves, but must 
be attended with its fruits, to wit, denying ungodliness; else it is so 
far from saving, that it is but a dead faith; and he is but a vain man 
that has no better, as St. James well affirms. The person believing must
 deny ungodliness, though this denial works nut his salvation." 'This is
 very true, if it is understood either of initial salvation, or of the 
primary cause of eternal salvation. "Our Saviour speaks to time same 
purpose: 'A good tree bringeth forth good fruit.' He does not say. the 
fruit makes it a good tree; yet the good fruit is inseparable. I speak 
not of quantities or degrees, &amp;c, but of the truth; to wit, a real 
and sincere denial of ungodliness." Excellent! To whip the dogs, the 
Rev. Mr. P-- need only prove, that when David robbed Uriah of the ewe 
lamb that lay in his bosom, tried to kill his soul with drunkenness, and
 treacherously killed his body with the sword of the Ammonites, he 
"really and sincerely denied ungodliness." And that his faith produced 
the good fruit, which is INSEPARABLE from saving faith. The moment this 
is done I promise the public to clear the pious Calvinists in general 
from the charge of speculative Antinomianism, Dr. Crisp in particular 
from that of glaring contradiction and his zealous second, who accuses 
me with "gross falsities," from Calvinistic rashness.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">We can no more exculpate warm Calvinists, when 
they betray holiness into time hands of practical Antinomians, because 
they now and then speak honourably of good works, than we can clear 
Pontius Pilate from the guilt of delivering the Messiah to time Jews, 
because he once solemnly "took water, and washed his hands before the 
multitude, saying, I find no fault in this just person: I am innocent of
 his blood: see ye to it." If the author of the "Whip for the Arminians"
 considers this, or if lie turns to Fourth Check, p. 224, where I 
produce D. Williams' observation concerning Dr. Crisp's inconsistency, 
he will be probably less forward in checking Checks that he has not 
candidly considered; and in making whips for the backs of his honest 
neighbours, lest sonic of them should take them from him to lash his 
mistakes, and chastise his precipitation.]  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">SECTION V. <i> </i></font>
</p><p><font size="4"><i>Mr. Berridge candidly grants the conditionality
 of perseverance, and consequently of election, by showing much respect 
to "Sergeant IF," who "guards the camp of Jesus." But soon picking </i>ii <i>quarrel
 with the valiant sergeant, he discharges him as a Jew, opens the camp 
to the Antinomians, by opposing to them only a sham sentinel, and shows 
the foundations of Calvinism in a most striking light.</i>  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">THE pious author of" <i>The Christian World Unmasked," </i>speaking of the Calvinistic doctrine of unconditional perseverance, which he confounds with the evangelical doctrine of <i>conditional </i>perseverance,
 (p. 194,) says with great truth, provided he had spoken of the latter: 
It "affords a stable prop to upright minds, yet lends no wanton cloak to
 corrupt hearts. It brings a cordial to revive the faint, and keeps a 
guard to check the forward. The guard attending on this doctrine is 
Sergeant IF; low in stature, but lofty in significance; a very valiant 
guard, though a monosyllable. Kind notice has been taken of the sergeant
 by Jesus Christ and his apostles; and much respect is due unto him, 
from all the Lord's recruiting officers, and every soldier iii his army.
 Pray listen to the sergeant's speech: 'IF ye continue in my word, then 
are ye <i>my </i>disciples indeed,' John viii, 31. 'IF <i>ye </i>do 
these things, ye shall never fall,' 2 Pet. i, 10. 'IF what ye have heard
 shall abide in you, ye shall continue in the Son and in the Father,' I 
John ii, 24. 'We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold steadfast unto
 the end,' Heb. iii, 14. 'Whoso looketh and continueth {that is, only he
 that looketh doth continue] in the perfect law of liberty, that man 
shall be blessed in his deed,'" James i, 25. And again, (p. 194,) "IF 
back-sliders fancy they must all be restored by repentance, because 
David was restored, and Peter was; they might as well suppose they must 
all be translated into heaven without dying,* because Enoch and Elijah 
were." (Page 199, 1. 17.)  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">[ * Here Mr. Berridge, in a fit of legality, far 
exceeds the limits of the truth which I maintain in the Checks; for he 
insinuates that the recovery of back. sliders is as improbable as their 
bodily translation into heaven. For my part, severe as I am represented 
to backsliders, I believe their return is ten thousand times more 
probable. than their going to heaven as Enoch and Elijah did.]  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Upon this plan of doctrine, we are ready to lay by
 our controversial pens, and shake hands with our Calvinist brethren. 
All that we desire of them, in order to a lasting agreement, is, (1.) To
 consider what is implied in the preceding concessions; and hot to gag 
Sergeant IF, when he honestly speaks the very words of" the Captain of 
our salvation," or those of the apostles, his lieutenant generals. (2 ) 
Not to call him a <i>Galatian </i>or a <i>Papist, </i>when he is found 
in company with St. James. (3.) Not to enter an action against him, for 
disturbing the peace of those backsliders, who, having denied the faith,
 and lost their first love now quietly hug a bosom sin, or take their 
Laodicean rest on the pillow of self election. (4.) Not to put him under
 arrest, for heading a platoon of those whom some of the elect call <i>diabolonians, </i>because they <i>doubt </i>the truth of <i>unconditional </i>election, or election without IF; and choose to fire at <i>sin, </i>rather than at their <i>captain. </i>And,
 (5.) Not to say to him, Hail! sergeant, kissing him as if he were a 
good Christian, in order to betray him with some decency into the hands 
of the Antinomians, as "a circumcised caitirn"  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Whether my pious opponent has not treated the 
honest sergeant in that manner, I leave the candid reader to determine. 
"Vet take notice," says he, (p. 194,) "that Sergeant IF is not of 
Jewish, but Christian parentage: not sprung from Levi, though a son of 
Abraham: no sentinel of Moses, but a watchman for the camp of Jesus. He 
wears no dripping beard, like the circumcised race; and is no legal 
blustering condition to purchase man's salvation, but a modest Gospel 
evidence to prove the truth of grace. He tells no idle tales." Enough, 
Rev. sir: if "he tells no idle tales," he does not cavil and quibble, 
much less does be deny his proper name, and well known meaning. Although
 he no more dreams of" purchasing man's salvation" than you do, yet he 
is conditional JF,--Sergeant IF,--a very valiant guard to the Scriptural
 doctrine of perseverance, and an irreconcilable enemy to Calvinian 
election, and "Antinomian dotages."  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">O ye opposers of the second Gospel axiom, "Pray come and peep!" See Calvinism <i>"unmasked" </i>by
 one of your principal leaders, who shows to the world the futile 
foundation of your doctrine of grace! Thanks be to his humorous honesty,
 we see now that those famous doctrines stand upon the 
super-metaphysical difference there is between IF and IF; between Jewish
 IF, and Christian non legal IF, and evangelical IF-- IF at Madeley, and
 IF at Everton. When IF, the culprit, appears in the Foundry pulpit, he 
tells idle tales, it seems! He shyly disguises himself! But when IF the 
orthodox shows himself in the desk at Ever-ton, (for it is to be feared 
that he seldom appears in the pulpit valiantly to guard Bible 
perseverance,) he never equivocates! When he says to people that never 
stood, or to people that can never fall, "IF ye do these things ye shall
 never fall," &amp;c, he is not a condition, and yet he never shuffles! 
These are strange hints indeed!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Patient reader, permit me to try, by the following
 questions, the solidity of the Calvinistic distinction between IF and 
IF, which supports the amazing weight of the great Diana. (N.) When the 
Gospel said to David, "IF thou dost these things thou shalt never fall,"
 and he fell into adultery; was "Sergeant IF a <i>modest </i>Gospel 
evidence to prove the truth of his grace?" And supposing be was such a 
modest evidence, did he "lend no wanton cloak to a corrupt heart?" (2.) 
When our Lord said to the young ruler, ' IF thou wilt be perfect, sell 
all;" was Sergeant IF of Jewish or Christian parentage? (3.) How shall I
 know when the sergeant is "a sentinel of Moses," or when he i-" a 
watchman for the camp of Jesus?" Should you answer, "Á Jewish IF wears a
 dripping beard," you may indeed, by such an argument, convince and 
entertain some Calvinists; but you leave me quite in the dark; and with 
"some very honest folks, who are cast in a Gospel foundry," instead of 
"ringing a fire bell," I smile at your wit and orthodoxy, but can no 
more understand what you mean by an IF, "with a dripping beard," than 
you could conceive what I would be at, if I spoke of a <i>yes, </i>with a long tail, or a <i>perhaps, </i>with
 dreadful horns! (4.) How shall I distinguish a "legal" from an 
evangelical IF - Should you say, that the "legal, blustering" sergeant 
wears a halberd, but the evangelical, mild IF has no weapon at all: I 
ask, What business has an unarmed IF in "the camp of Jesus?" Why do you 
call him sergeant - Is he not a sham sentinel, a ridiculous scarecrow, 
to deceive the simple, rather than "a very valiant guard to check the 
forward?" (5.) How shall I make a difference between an Everton IF, and a
 Madeley IF? When I have read my Bible in both places, I have always 
found the sergeant exactly of the same stature; he always appeared in 
the same black regimentals: and to this day a Madeley IF exactly answers
 to the description that the pious vicar of Everton gives of him. He is 
"a monosyllable, low in stature, but of lofty significance." Whereas the
 Everton IF is yet lower in significance than in stature, since you make
 him signify just nothing. Should you reply, that a Madeley w is t" like
 one of the circumcised race;" I answer that, although about eleven 
years ago, I circumcised him with an Antinomian knife, yet I did not 
mutilate him. But I could name a Gospel minister, who has "served more 
than three apprenticeships at a noted "hall of physic," by whom the 
unhappy sergeant has not only been "circumcised," but quite emasculated;
 yea, deprived of his very vitals. For when IF, in the above-quoted 
scriptures, is absolutely divested of conditionality, and turned into an
 unnecessary evidence of grace, which the elect can do without, as well 
as David and Solomon; may it not be compared to a dead sergeant, whose 
lungs and heart are pulled out: and whose ill-smelling remains, far from
 being a "valiant guard" against the forward, prove an enticing lure to 
unclean birds, who fly about in search of a carcass!  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">Excuse, reader, this prolix and ludicrous defence 
of the sergeant. The subject, though treated in so queer a manner, is of
 the utmost importance; for the Minutes, the Checks, and the second 
Gospel axiom, stand or fall with Sergeant IF. If he is a coward, a 
knave, or a cipher, Antinomianism will still prevail; but if he recovers
 his true and lofty significance, he will soon rid the Church of 
Antinomian dotages. As "much respect is due unto him," and to St. James'
 undefiled religion, which the ingenious book I quote indirectly 
undermines, I thought it my duty to "open my bag" also, and let out a 
ferret; or to speak exactly the language of Everton, "a fox," to chase 
"a straggling goose hard at hand." Take notice, however, that by the 
"goose," I do not mean the reverend author of <i>The World Unmasked, </i>for he has wit enough, and to spare; but the <i>"ImddNin' dame," </i>Calvinistic contradiction, alias <i>Logica Genevensis. </i>And
 now, reader, I lay her before thee, not to make thee "sup" upon her, 
"amidst a deal of cackling music," but that thou wouldst help me to nail
 her up to the everlasting doors of the temple of truth, as sportsmen do
 cranes and foxes to the doors of their rural buildings.  </font>
</p><p align="center"><font size="4">CONCLUSION.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">WERE I to conclude these strictures upon the dangerous tenets, inadvertently advanced, and happily contradicted, in <i>The Christian World Unmasked, </i>without
 professing my brotherly love and sincere respect for the ingenious and 
pious author; I should wrong him, myself, and the cause which I defend. I
 only do him justice, when I say, that few, very few of our elders, 
equal him in devotedness to Christ, zeal, diligence, and ministerial 
success. His indefatigable labours in the word and doctrine, entitle him
 to a double share of honour; and I invite all my readers with me to 
"esteem him highly in love for" his Master's and "his work's sake;" 
entreating them not to undervalue his vital piety, on account of his 
Antinomian opinion; and beseeching them to consider, that his errors are
 so much the more excusable, as they do not influence his moral conduct,
 and he refutes them himself, far more than his favourite scheme of 
doctrine allows him to do. Add to this, that those very errors spring, 
in a great degree, from the idea, that he honours Christ by receiving, 
and does God service by propagating them.  </font>
</p><p><font size="4">The desire of catching the attention of his 
readers has made him choose a witty, facetious manner of writing, for 
which he has a peculiar turn; and the necessity I am under of standing 
his indirect attack, obliges me to meet him upon his own ground, and to 
encounter him with his own weapons. I beg that what passes for 
evangelical humour in him may not be called indecent levity in me. A 
sharp pen may be guided by a kind heart; and such, I am persuaded, is 
that of my much esteemed antagonist, whom I publicly invite to my 
pulpit; protesting that I should be edified, and overjoyed, to hear him 
enforce there the guarded substance of his book, which, notwithstanding 
the vein of Solifidianism I have taken the liberty to open, contains 
many great and glorious truths.  </font>
