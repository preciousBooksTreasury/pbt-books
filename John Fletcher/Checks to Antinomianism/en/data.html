<h1>FIRST CHECK TO ANTINOMIANISM</h1>

<h2>LETTER I. </h2>
<p>HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR, -- Before a judge 
passes sentence upon a person accused of theft, he hears what his 
neighbors have to say for his character. Mr. Wesley, I grant, is accused
 of what is worse than theft, <i>dreadful heresy; </i>and I know that whosoever maintains a dreadful heresy is a <i>dreadful heretic; </i>and that the Church of Rome shows no<i> </i>mercy
 to such. But may not "real Protestants" indulge, with the privilege of a
 felon, one whom they so lately respected as a brother? And may not I, 
an old friend and acquaintance of his, be permitted to speak a word in 
his favor, before he is branded in the forehead, as he has already been 
on the back?  
</p><p>This step, I fear, will cost me my reputation, (if
 I have any,) and involve me in the same condemnation with him whose 
cause, together with that of truth, I design to plead. But when humanity
 prompts, when gratitude calls, when friendship excites, when reason 
invites, when justice demands, when truth requires, and conscience 
summons, he does not deserve the name of a <i>Christian friend, </i>who,
 for any consideration, hesitates to vindicate what he esteems truth, 
and to stand by an aggrieved friend, brother, and father. Were I not, 
sir, on such an occasion as this to step out of my beloved obscurity, 
you might deservedly reproach me as a <i>dastardly wretch: </i>nay, you 
have already done it in general terms, in your excellent sermon on the 
fear of man. "How often," say you, "do men sneakingly forsake their 
friends, instead of gloriously supporting them against a powerful 
adversary, even when their cause is just, for reasons hastily 
prudential, for fear of giving umbrage to a superior party or interest?"  
</p><p>These generous words of yours, Rev. sir, together with the leave you give both Churchmen and Dissenters to direct to <i>you </i>their
 answers to your circular letter, are my excuse for intruding upon you 
by this epistle, and my apology for begging your candid attention, while
 I attempt to convince you that my friend's principles and Minutes are 
not heretical. In order to this, I shall lay before you, and the 
principal persons, both clergy and laity, whom you have, from all parts 
of England and Wales, convened at Bristol, by printed letters, -- <br clear="left">
   
</p><p>I. A general view of the Rev. Mr. Wesley's doctrine.  
</p><p>II. An account of the commendable design of his Minutes.  
</p><p>III. A vindication of the propositions which they 
contain, by arguments taken from Scripture, reason, and experience; and 
by quotations from eminent Calvinist divines, who have said the same 
things in different words.  
</p><p>And suppose you yourself, sir, in particular, should appear to be a strong assertor of the doctrines which you call a <i>dreadful heresy </i>in
 Mr. Wesley, I hope you will not refuse me leave to conclude, by 
expostulating with you upon your conduct in this affair, and 
recommending to you, and our other Christian friends, the forbearance 
which you recommend to others, in one of your sermons: "Why doth the 
narrow heart of man pursue with malice or rashness those who presume to 
differ from him?" Yea, and what is more extraordinary, those who agree 
with him in all essential points?  
</p><p>I. When, in an intricate case, a prudent judge is 
afraid to pass an unjust sentence, he inquires, as I observed, into the 
general conduct of the person accused, and by that means frequently 
finds out the truth which he investigates. As that method may be of 
service in the present case, permit me, sir, to lay before you a general
 view of Mr. Wesley's doctrine.  
</p><p>1. For above these sixteen years I have heard him 
frequently in his chapels, and sometimes in my church: I have familiarly
 conversed and corresponded with him, and have often perused his 
numerous works in verse and prose: and I can truly say that, during all 
that time, I have heard him, upon every proper occasion, steadily 
maintain <i>the total fall of man in Adam</i>, and his utter inability 
to recover himself, or take any one step toward his recovery, "without 
the grace of God preventing him, that he may have a good will, and 
working with him when he has that good will."  
</p><p>The deepest expressions that ever struck my ears 
on the melancholy subject of our natural depravity and helplessness, are
 those which dropped from his lips: and I have ever observed that he 
constantly ascribes to Divine grace, not only the good works and holy 
tempers of believers, but all the good thoughts of upright heathens, and
 the good desires of those professors whom he sees "begin in the Spirit 
and end in the flesh:" when, to my great surprise, some of those who 
accuse him of "robbing God of the glory of his grace, and ascribing too 
much to man's power," directly or indirectly maintain that Demas and his
 fellow apostates never had any grace; and that if once they went on far
 in the ways of God, it was merely by the force of fallen nature; a 
sentiment which Mr. Wesley looks upon as diametrically opposite to the 
humbling assertion of our Lord, "Without me ye can do nothing;" and 
which he can no more admit than the rankest Pelagianism.  
</p><p>2. I must likewise testify, that he faithfully points out <i>Christ as the only way of salvation; </i>and
 strongly recommends faith as the only mean of receiving him, and all 
the benefits of his righteous life and meritorious death: and truth 
obliges me to declare, that he frequently expresses his detestation of 
the errors of modern Pharisees, who laugh at original sin, set up the 
powers of fallen man, cry down the operation of God's Spirit, deny the 
absolute necessity of the blood and righteousness of Christ, and refuse 
him the glory of all the good that may be found in Jew or Gentile. And 
you will not without difficulty, sir, find in England, and perhaps in 
all the world, a minister who hath borne more frequent testimonies, 
either from the pulpit or the press, against those dangerous errors. All
 his works confirm my assertion, especially his sermons on Original Sin,
 and Salvation by Faith, and his masterly Refutation of Dr. Taylor, the 
wisest Pelagian and Socinian of our age. Nor am I afraid to have this 
testimony confronted with his Minutes, being fully persuaded that, when 
they are candidly explained, they rather confirm than overthrow it.  
</p><p>His manner of preaching the fall and the recovery 
of man is attended with a peculiar advantage: it is close and 
experimental. He not only points out the truth of those doctrines, but 
presses his hearers to cry to God that they may feel their weight upon 
their hearts. Some open those great truths very clearly, but let their 
congregations rest, like the stony ground hearers, in the first emotions
 of sorrow and joy which the word frequently excites. Not so Mr. Wesley:
 he will have true penitents "feel the plague of their own hearts, 
travail, be heavy laden," and receive "the sentence of death in 
themselves," according to the glorious "ministration of condemnation:" 
and according to "the ministration of righteousness and of the Spirit 
which exceeds in glory," he insists upon true believers knowing for 
themselves, that Jesus "hath power on earth to forgive sins;" and 
asserts, that they "taste the good word of God, and the powers of the 
world to come," and that they "are made partakers of the Holy Ghost and 
the Divine nature; the Spirit itself bearing witness with their spirits 
that they are the children of God."  
</p><p>3. The next fundamental doctrine in Christianity is that of <i>holiness of heart and life; </i>and
 no one can here accuse Mr. Wesley of leaning to the Antinomian 
delusion, which "makes void the law through" a speculative and barren 
"faith." On the contrary, he appears to be peculiarly set for the 
defense of practical religion: for, instead of representing Christ "as 
the minister of sin," with Ranters, to the great grief and offence of 
many, he sets him forth as a complete <i>Savior from sin. </i>Not 
satisfied to preach holiness begun, he preaches finished holiness, and 
calls believers to such a degree of heart-purifying faith, as may enable
 them to triumph in Christ, as "being made to them of God, 
sanctification as well as righteousness."  
</p><p>It is, I grant, his misfortune (if indeed it be 
one) to preach a fuller salvation than most professors expect to enjoy 
here; for he asserts that Jesus can "make clean" <i>the inside </i>as well as the <i>outside </i>of
 his vessels unto honor; that he hath power on earth "to save his people
 from their sins;" and that his blood "cleanses from all sin," from the 
guilt and defilement both of original and actual corruption. He is bold 
enough to declare, with St. John, that "if we say we have no sin, <i>either by nature or practice, </i>we
 deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us: but if we confess our 
sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
 from all unrighteousness." He is legal enough not to be ashamed of 
these words of Moses: "The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and
 the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, 
and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live." And he dares to believe 
that the Lord can perform the words which he spoke by Ezekiel: "I will 
sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: from ALL your 
filthiness and from ALL your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also 
will I give you: I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
 I will give you a heart of flesh; and I will put my Spirit within you, 
and cause you to walk in my statutes; and ye shall keep my judgments, 
and do them. I will also save you from <i>all </i>your uncleannesses." 
Hence it is that he constantly exhorts his hearers "to grow in grace, 
and in the knowledge of our Savior;" till by a strong and lively faith 
they can continually "reckon themselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but 
alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." He tells them, that "he 
who committeth sin, is the servant of sin;" -- that "our old man is 
crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that 
henceforth we should not serve sin;" -- that "if the Son shall make us 
free, we shall be free indeed;" -- and that although <i>"the </i>law of 
the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" will not deliver us from the 
innocent infirmities incident to flesh and blood, it will nevertheless 
make us "free from the law of sin and death," and enable us to say with 
holy triumph, "how shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer 
therein?" In a word, he thinks that God can so "shed abroad his love in 
our hearts, by the Holy Ghost given unto us," as to "sanctify us wholly,
 soul, body, and spirit;" and enable us to "rejoice evermore, pray 
without ceasing, and in every thing give thanks." And he is persuaded, 
that He who "can do far exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask 
or think," is able to fill us with the "perfect love which casts out 
fear; that we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies," may 
have "the mind which was in Christ;" be righteous as the <i>man </i>Jesus
 was righteous; "walk as he also walked," and be in our measure, "as he 
was in the world:" he as the stock of the tree of righteousness, and we 
as the branches, "having our fruit" from him "unto Holiness," and 
"serving God without fear in true holiness and righteousness all the 
days of our life."  
</p><p>This he sometimes calls <i>full sanctification, </i>the
 state of "fathers in Christ," or, the "glorious liberty of the children
 of God;" sometimes "a being strengthened, stablished, and settled;" or 
"being rooted and grounded in love;" but most commonly he calls it <i>Christian perfection: </i>a
 word which, though used by the apostles in the same sense, cannot be 
used by him without raising the pity or indignation of one half of the 
religious world; some making it the subject of their pious sneers and 
godly lampoons; while others tell you roundly "they abhor it above every
 thing in the creation." <i> </i>
</p><p><i>Tantaene animis caelestibus irae!</i>  
</p><p>On account of this doctrine it is that he is 
traduced as a Pharisee, a papist, an antichrist; some of his opposers 
taking it for granted that he makes void the priestly office of Christ, 
by affirming that his blood can so completely wash us here from our 
sins, that at death we shall "be found of him in peace, without spot, 
wrinkle, or any such thing;" while others, to color their opposition to 
the many scriptures which he brings to support this unfashionable 
doctrine, give it out, that he only wants the old man to be so refined 
in all his tempers, and regulated in all his outward behavior, as to 
appear perfect in the flesh; or, in other terms, that he sets up 
Pharisaic SELF, instead of "Christ <i>completely </i>formed in us <i>as the full </i>hope
 of glory." But I must (for one) do him the justice to say he is 
misapprehended, and that what he calls perfection is nothing but the 
rich cluster of all the spiritual blessings promised to believers in the
 Gospel; and, among the rest, a continual sense of the virtue of 
Christ's atoning and purifying blood, preventing both old guilt from 
returning and new guilt from fastening upon the conscience; together 
with the deepest consciousness of our helplessness and nothingness in 
our best estate, the most endearing discoveries of the Redeemer's love, 
and the most humbling and yet ravishing views of his glorious fullness. 
Witness one of his favorite hymns on that subject  </p><blockquote>Confound, o'erpower me with thy grace;<br clear="left">
I would be by myself abhorr'd:<br clear="left">
All might, all majesty, all praise,<br clear="left">
All glory be to Christ my Lord!)<br clear="left">
<br clear="left">
Now let me gain perfection's height,<br clear="left">
Now let me into nothing fall;<br clear="left">
Be less than nothing in my sight,<br clear="left">
And feel that <i>Christ is all in all.</i></blockquote> 
<p>4<i>. </i>But this is not all: he holds also <i>general redemption, </i>and its necessary consequences, which some account <i>dreadful heresies. </i>He
 asserts with St. Paul, that "Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death 
for every man;" and this grace he calls free, as extending itself <i>freely </i>to
 all. Nor can he help expressing his surprise at those pious ministers 
who maintain that the Savior keeps his grace, as they suppose he kept 
his blood, from the greatest part of mankind, and yet engross to 
themselves the title of <i>preachers of</i> FREE <i>grace!</i>  
</p><p>He frequently observes, with the same apostle, that "Christ is the Savior of <i>all </i>men, but especially of them that believe;" and that "God will have <i>all </i>men to be saved," consistently with their moral agency, and the tenor of his Gospel.  
</p><p>With St. John he maintains that "God is love," and
 that "Christ is the propitiation not only for our sins, but also for 
the sins of the <i>whole world." </i>With David he affirms that "God's mercy is over <i>all </i>his works:" and with St. Peter, that "the Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that <i>all </i>should come to repentance;" yea, that God, without hypocrisy, "commandeth <i>all </i>men, <i>every where, </i>to
 repent." Accordingly he says with the Son of God, "Whosoever will, let 
him come and take of the water of life freely;" and after his blessed 
example, as well as by his gracious command, he "preaches the Gospel TO <i>every creature;</i>" which he apprehends would be inconsistent with common honesty, if there were not a Gospel FOR <i>every creature. </i>Nor
 can he doubt of it in the least, when he considers that Christ is a 
king as well as a priest; that we are under a law to him; that those men
 who "will not have him to reign over them, shall be brought and slain 
before him;" yea, that he will "judge the secrets of men," according to 
St. Paul's Gospel, and take vengeance on all them that obey not his <i>own </i>Gospel, <i>and </i>be the author of eternal salvation to <i>none but </i>them
 that obey him. With this principle, as with a key given us by God 
himself, he opens those things which are "hard to be understood," in the
 Epistles of St. Paul, and "which they that are unlearned and unstable 
wrest, as they do some other scriptures, <i>if not </i>to their own destruction, <i>at least to </i>the overthrowing of the faith of some" weak Christians, and the hardening of many, very many infidels.  
</p><p>As a true son of the Church of England, he 
believes that "Christ redeemed him and all mankind;" that "for us men," 
and not merely for the <i>elect, </i>"he came down from heaven, and made
 upon the cross a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and
 satisfaction, for the sins of the <i>whole </i>world." Like an honest 
man, and yet a man of sense, he so subscribed the seventeenth article as
 not to reject the thirty-first, which he thinks of equal force, and 
much more explicit; and, therefore, as the seventeenth article 
authorizes him, he "receives God's promises in suchwise as they are 
generally set forth in holy Scripture;" rejecting, after the example of 
our governors in Church and state, the Lambeth articles, in which the 
doctrine of <i>absolute unconditional </i>election and reprobation was 
maintained, and which some Calvinistic divines, in the days of Queen 
Elizabeth, vainly attempted to impose upon these kingdoms, by adding 
them to the thirty-nine articles. Far, therefore, from thinking he does 
not act a fair part in rejecting the doctrine of particular redemption, 
he cannot conceive by what salve the consciences of those ministers, who
 embrace it, can permit them to say to each of their communicants, "The 
blood of Christ was shed for <i>thee;</i>" and to baptize promiscuously <i>all </i>children
 within their respective parishes, "in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," when all that are unredeemed have no 
more right to the <i>blood, name, </i>and <i>Spirit </i>of Christ, than Lucifer himself.  
</p><p>Thus far Mr. Wesley agrees with Arminius, because 
he thinks that illustrious divine agreed thus far with the Scriptures, 
and all the early fathers of the Church. But if Arminius, (as the author
 of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis </i>affirms, in his letter to Dr. Adams,) 
"denied, that man's nature is totally corrupt; and asserted, that he 
hath still* a freedom of will to turn to God, but not without the 
assistance of grace," Mr. Wesley is no Arminian; for he strongly asserts
 the <i>total </i>fall of man, and constantly maintains that by nature 
man's will is only free to evil, and that Divine grace must first 
prevent, and then continually farther him, to make him willing and able 
to turn to God.  
</p><p>* [This is worded in so ambiguous a manner, as to 
give readers room to think that Arminius held man hath a will to turn to
 God before grace prevents (goes before) him, and only wants some Divine
 assistance to finish what nature has power to begin. In this sense of 
the words it is I deny Mr. Wesley is an Arminian.]  
</p><p>I must, however, confess, that he does not, as some <i>real Protestants, </i>continually
 harp upon the words FREE grace, and FREE will; but he gives reasons of 
considerable weight for this. (1.) Christ and his apostles never did so.
 (2.) He knows the word <i>grace </i>necessarily implies the <i>freeness </i>of a favor; and the word <i>will, </i>the
 freedom of our choice: and he has too much sense to delight in 
perpetual tautology. (3.) He finds, by blessed experience, that when the
 will is touched by Divine grace, and yields to the touch, it is as free
 to good, as it was before to evil. He dares not, therefore, make the 
maintaining <i>free</i> <i>will, </i>any more than <i>free breath, </i>the criterion of an unconverted man. On the contrary, he believes none are converted but those who have a <i>free will </i>to
 follow Jesus; and, far from being ashamed to be called a "free-willer,"
 he affirms it as essential to all men to be "free-willing creatures," 
as to be "rational animals;" and he supposes he can as soon find a 
diamond or a flint without gravity, as a good or bad man without free 
will.  
</p><p>Nor will I conceal that I never heard him use that favorite expression of some good men, <i>Why me? Why me? </i>though
 he is not at all against their using it, if they can do it to 
edification. But as he does not see that any of the saints, either of 
the Old or New Testament ever used it, he is afraid to be humble and 
"wise above what is written," lest "voluntary humility" should introduce
 refined pride before he is aware. Doubting, therefore, whether he could
 say, <i>Why me</i>? <i>Why me? </i>without the self-pleasing idea of 
his being preferred to thousands, or without a touch of the secret self 
applause that tickles the Pharisee's heart, when he "thanks God he is 
not as other men," he leaves the fashionable exclamation to others, with
 all the refinements of modern divinity; and chooses to keep to St. 
Paul's expression, "He loved me," which implies no exclusion of his poor
 fellow sinners; or to that of the royal psalmist, "Lord, what is <i>man, </i>that thou art mindful of him; and the son <i>of man, </i>that thou visitest him."  
</p><p>5. As a consequence of the doctrine of general 
redemption, Mr. Wesley lays down two axioms, of which he never loses 
sight in his preaching. <i>The first </i>is, that ALL OUR SALVATION IS 
OF GOD IN CHRIST, and therefore OF GRACE; -- all opportunities, 
invitations, inclination, and power to believe being bestowed upon us of
 mere grace; -- grace most absolutely free: and so far, I hope, that all
 who are called Gospel ministers agree with him. But he proceeds 
farther; for, <i>secondly, </i>he asserts with equal confidence, that 
according to the Gospel dispensation, ALL OUR DAMNATION IS OF OURSELVES,
 by our obstinate unbelief and avoidable unfaithfulness; as we may 
"neglect so great salvation," desire to "be excused" from coming to the 
feast of the Lamb, "make light of" God's gracious offers, refuse to 
"occupy," bury our talent, and act the part of the "slothful servant;" 
or, in other words, "resist, grieve, do despite to," and "quench the 
Spirit of grace," <i>by our moral agency.</i> <i> </i>
</p><p><i>The first </i>of these evangelical axioms he 
builds upon such scriptures as these: -- "In me is thy help. Look unto 
me and be saved. No man cometh unto me except the Father draw him. What 
hast thou that thou hast not received? We are not sufficient to think 
aright of ourselves, all our sufficiency is of God. Christ is exalted to
 give repentance. Faith is the gift of God. Without me ye can do 
nothing," &amp;c, &amp;c.  
</p><p>And <i>the second </i>he founds upon such passages
 as these: "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
 and men loved darkness rather than light. Ye always resist the Holy 
Ghost. They rejected the counsel of God toward themselves. Grieve not 
the Spirit. Quench not the Spirit. My Spirit shall not always strive 
with man. Turn, why will ye die? Kiss the Son, lest ye perish. I gave 
Jezebel time to repent, and she repented not. The goodness of God leads 
[not <i>drags</i>,]<i> </i>thee to repentance, who after thy hardness 
and impenitent heart treasurest up wrath unto thyself. Their eyes have 
they closed, lest they should see, and be converted, and I should heal 
them. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh from heaven. I set before
 you life and death, choose life! Ye will not come unto me that ye might
 have life. I <i>would </i>have gathered you, and ye <i>would not," </i>&amp;c, &amp;c.  
</p><p>As to the <i>moral agency </i>of man, Mr. Wesley thinks it cannot be denied upon the principles of common sense and civil government; much less upon those<i> </i>of
 natural and revealed religion; as nothing would be more absurd than to 
bind us by laws of a civil or spiritual nature; nothing more foolish 
than to propose to us punishments and rewards; and nothing more 
capricious than to inflict the one or bestow the other upon us; if we 
were not <i>moral agents.</i>  
</p><p>He is therefore persuaded, the most complete 
system of divinity is that in which neither of those two axioms is 
superseded: He thinks it is bold and unscriptural to set up the one at 
the expense of the other, convinced that the prophets, the apostles, and
 Jesus Christ left us no such precedent; and that, to avoid what is 
termed <i>legality, </i>we must not run into refinements which they knew
 nothing of, and make them perpetually contradict themselves: nor can 
we, he believes, without an open violation of the laws of candor and 
criticism, lay a greater stress upon a few obscure and controverted 
passages, than upon a hundred plain and irrefragable Scripture proofs. 
He therefore supposes that those persons are under a capital mistake who
 maintain only the first Gospel axiom, and under pretence of securing to
 God <i>all </i>the glory of the salvation of <i>one </i>elect, give to perhaps <i>twenty </i>reprobates full room to lay <i>all </i>the blame of their damnation either upon their first parents, or their Creator. This way of making twenty <i>real </i>holes, in order to stop a <i>supposed </i>one, he cannot see consistent either with wisdom or Scripture.  
</p><p>Thinking it therefore safest not to "put asunder" 
the truths which "God has joined together," he makes all extremes meet 
in one blessed Scriptural medium. With the Antinomian he preaches, "God 
worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure;" and with 
the Legalist he cries, "Work out, therefore, your own salvation with 
fear and trembling;" and thus he has all St. Paul's doctrine. With the 
Ranter he says, "God has chosen you, you are elect;" but, as it is 
"through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth," with the
 disciples of Moses he infers, "make your calling and election sure, for
 if ye do these things ye shall never <i>fall." </i>Thus he presents his hearers with all St. Peter's system of truth, which the others had rent to pieces.  
</p><p>Again, according to the <i>first </i>axiom, he says with the perfect Preacher, "All things are now ready;" but with him he adds also, according to the <i>second, </i>"Come,
 lest you never taste the Gospel feast." Thinking it extremely dangerous
 not to divide the word of God aright, he endeavors to give to every one
 the portion of it that suits him, cutting, according to times, persons,
 and circumstances, either with the smooth or the rough edge of his 
two-edged sword. Therefore, when he addresses those that are steady, and
 "partakers of the Gospel grace from the first day until now," as the 
Philippians, he makes use of the <i>first </i>principle, and testifies 
his confidence, "that he who hath begun a good work in them, will 
perform it until the day of Christ." But when he expostulates with 
persons, "that ran well, and do not now obey the truth," according to 
his <i>second </i>axiom, he says to them, as St. Paul did to the Galatians, "I stand in doubt of you; ye are fallen from grace."  
</p><p>In short, he would think that he mangled the 
Gospel, and forgot part of his awful commission, if, when he has 
declared that "he who believeth shall be saved," he did not also add, 
that he "who believeth not shall be damned;" or, which is the same, that
 none perish merely for Adam's sin, but for their own unbelief, and 
willful rejection of the Savior's grace. Thus he advances God's glory 
every way, entirely ascribing to his mercy and grace all the salvation 
of the elect, and completely freeing him from the blame of directly or 
indirectly hanging the millstone of damnation about the neck of the 
reprobate. And this he effectually does, by showing that the former owe 
all they are, and all they have, to creating, preserving, and redeeming 
love, whose innumerable bounties they freely and continually receive; 
and that the rejection of the latter has absolutely no cause but their 
obstinate rejecting of that astonishing mercy which wept over Jerusalem;
 and prayed, and bled even for those that shed the atoning blood -- the 
blood that expiated all sin but that of final unbelief.  
</p><p>I have now finished my sketch of Mr. Wesley's 
doctrine, so far as it has fallen under my observation during above 
sixteen years' particular acquaintance with him and his works. It is not
 my design, sir, to inquire into the truth of his sentiments, much less 
shall I attempt to prove them orthodox, according to the ideas that some
 <i>real Protestants </i>entertain of orthodoxy. This only I beg leave 
to observe: Suppose he is mistaken in all the scriptures on which he 
founds his doctrine of Christian perfection and general redemption, yet 
his mistakes seem rather to arise from a regard for Christ's glory, than
 from enmity to his offices; and all together do not amount to any 
heresy at all; the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, namely, <i>the fall of man, justification by the merits of Christ, sanctification by the agency of the Holy Spirit, </i>and <i>the worship of the one true God in the mysterious distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, </i>as it is maintained in the three creeds, not being at all affected by any of his peculiar sentiments.  
</p><p>But you possibly imagine, sir, that he has lately 
changed his doctrine, and adopted a new system. If you do, you are under
 a very great mistake; and to convince you of it, permit me to conclude 
this letter by a paragraph of one which I received from him last spring:
 --  
</p><p>"I always did (for between these thirty and forty 
years) clearly assert the total fall of man, and his utter inability to 
do any, good of himself: the absolute necessity of the grace and Spirit 
of God to raise even a good thought or desire in our hearts: the Lord's 
rewarding no works, and accepting of none, but so far as they proceed 
from his preventing, convincing, and converting grace, through the 
Beloved; the blood and righteousness of Christ being the sole 
meritorious cause of our salvation. And who is there in England that has
 asserted these things more strongly and steadily than I have done?"  
</p><p>Leaving you to answer this question, I remain, 
with due respect, Hon. and Rev. sir, your obedient servant, in the bond 
of a peaceful Gospel,

</p><p>MADELEY, <i>July </i>29, 1771. <font size="5"><b> </b>
</p><p><font size="5"><b>LETTER II. </b> 
</p><p>HONOURED AND REVEREND Sir, -- Having proved that 
Mr. Wesley's doctrine is not heretical, permit me to consider the 
propositions which close the Minutes of his last conference, on which, 
it seems, your charge of <i>dreadful heresy </i>is founded.  
</p><p>They wear, I confess, a new aspect; and such is 
the force of prejudice and attachment to particular modes of expression,
 that at first they appear to be very unguarded, if not altogether 
erroneous. But when the din of the severe epithets bestowed upon them by
 some warm friends was out of my ears; when I had prayed to the Father 
of lights for meekness of wisdom, and given place to calm reflection, I 
saw them in quite a different light. Our Lord commands us "not to judge 
according to the appearance, but to judge righteous judgment;" 
appearances, therefore, did not seem to me sufficient to condemn any 
man, much less an elder, and such an elder as Mr. Wesley. I consider, 
beside, that the circumstances in which a minister sometimes finds 
himself with respect to his hearers, and particular<i> </i>errors 
spreading among them, may oblige him to do or say things, which, though 
very right according to the time, place, persons, and juncture, may yet 
appear very wrong to those who do not stand just where he does. I saw, 
for example, that if St. Paul had been in St. James's circumstances, he 
would have preached justification in as guarded a manner as St. James; 
and that if St. James had been in St. Paul's place, he would have 
preached it as freely as St. Paul; and I recollected that in some places
 St. Paul himself seems even more Legal than St. James. See Rom. ii, 7, 
10, 14; Gal. vi, 7, &amp;c, and 1 Tim. vi, 19.  
</p><p>These reflections made me not only suspend my 
judgment concerning Mr. Wesley's propositions, but consider what we may 
candidly suppose was his design in writing them for, and recommending 
them to the preachers in connection with him. And I could not help 
seeing that it was only to guard them and their hearers against 
Antinomian principles and practices, which spread like wild fire in some
 of his societies; where persons who spoke in the most glorious manner 
of Christ, and their interest in his complete salvation, have been found
 living in the greatest immoralities, or indulging the most unchristian 
tempers. Nor need I go far for a proof of this sad assertion. In one of 
his societies, not many miles from my parish, a married man, who 
professed being <i>in a state of justification and sanctification, </i>growing
 wise above what is written, despised his brethren as legalists, and his
 teachers as persons not clear in the Gospel. He instilled his 
principles into a serious young woman; and what was the consequence? Why
 they talked about "finished salvation in Christ," and "the absurdity of
 perfection in the flesh," till a perfect child was conceived and born; 
and, to save appearances, the mother swore it to a travelling man that 
cannot be heard of. Thus, to avoid legality, they plunged into 
hypocrisy, fornication, adultery, perjury, and the depth of Ranterism. 
Is it not hard, that a minister should be traduced as guilty of <i>dreadful heresy, </i>for
 trying to put a stop to such dreadful practices? And is it not high 
time that he should cry to all that regard his warnings, "Take heed to 
your doctrine?" As if he had said,  
</p><p>"Avoid all extremes. While on the one hand you 
keep clear of the Pharisaic delusion that slights Christ, and makes the 
pretended merit of an imperfect obedience the procuring cause of eternal
 life; see that on the other hand you do not lean to the Antinomian 
error, which, under pretence of exalting Christ, speaks contemptuously 
of obedience, and "makes void the law through a faith that <i>does not </i>work
 by love." As there is but a step between high Arminianism and 
self-righteousness, so there is but one between high Calvinism and 
Antinomianism. I charge you to shun both, especially the latter.  
</p><p>"You know, by sad experience, that at this time we
 stand particularly in danger of splitting upon the Antinomian rock. 
Many smatterers in Christian experience talk of <i>finished</i> <i>salvation in Christ, </i>or
 boast of being in a state of justification and sanctification, while 
they know little of themselves and less of Christ. Their whole behavior 
testifies, that their hearts are void of humble love, and full of carnal
 confidence. They cry, <i>Lord! Lord! </i>with as much assurance and as 
little right as the foolish virgins. They pass for sweet Christians, 
dear children of God, and good believers; but their secret reserves 
evidence them to be only such believers as Simon Magus, Ananias, and 
Sapphira.  
</p><p>"Some, with Diotrephes, 'love to have the 
pre-eminence, and prate malicious words,' and not content therewith, 
'they do not themselves receive the brethren, and forbid them that 
would,' and even cast them out of the Church as heretics. Some have 
'forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of 
Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; they are wells without 
water, clouds without rain, and trees without fruit:' with Judas they 
try to 'load themselves with thick clay,' endeavor to 'lay up treasures 
on earth, and make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.'
 Some, with the incestuous Corinthian, are led captive by fleshly lusts,
 and fall into the greatest enormities. Others, with the language of the
 awakened publican in their mouths, are fast asleep in their spirits; 
you hear them speak of the corruptions of their hearts, in as unaffected
 and airy a manner, as if they talked of freckles upon their faces. It 
seems they run down their sinful nature only to apologize for their 
sinful practices; or to appear great proficients in self-knowledge, and 
court the praise due to genuine humility.  
</p><p>"Others, quietly settled on the lees of the 
Laodicean state, by the whole tenor of their life say, 'they are rich 
and increased in goods, and have need of nothing;' utter strangers to 
'hunger and thirst after righteousness,' they never importunately beg, 
never wrestle hard for the hidden manna. On the contrary, they sing a <i>requiem </i>to
 their poor dead souls, and say, 'Soul, take thine ease, thou hast goods
 laid up (in Christ) for many years, yea, for ever and ever;' and thus, 
like Demas, they go on talking of Christ and heaven, but loving their 
ease, and enjoying this present world.  
</p><p>"Yet many of these, like Herod, hear and entertain
 us gladly; but, like him also, they keep their beloved sin, pleading 
for it as a right eye, and saving it as a right hand. To this day their 
bosom corruption is not only alive, but indulged; their treacherous 
Delilah is hugged; and their spiritual 'Agag walks delicately,' and 
boasts that 'the bitterness of death is past,' and he shall never be 
'hewed in pieces before the Lord:' nay, to dare so much as to talk of 
his <i>dying </i>before the body, becomes almost an unpardonable crime.  
</p><p>"Forms and fair shows of godliness deceive us: 
many, whom our Lord might well compare to 'whited sepulchers,' look like
 angels of light when they are abroad, and prove tormenting fiends at 
home. <i>We</i> see them weep under sermons; we hear them pray and sing 
with the tongues of men and angels; they even profess the faith that 
removes mountains; and yet, by and by, we discover they stumble at every
 mole hill; every trifling temptation throws them into peevishness, 
fretfulness, impatience, ill humor, discontent, anger, and sometimes 
into loud passion.  
</p><p>"Relative duties are by many grossly neglected: 
husbands slight their wives, or wives neglect and plague their husbands:
 children are spoiled, parents disregarded, and masters disobeyed: yea, 
so many are the complaints against servants professing godliness, on 
account of their unfaithfulness, indolence, pert answering again, 
forgetfulness of their menial condition, or insolent expectations, that 
some serious persons prefer those who have no knowledge of the truth, to
 those who make a high profession of it.  
</p><p>"Knowledge is certainly <i>increased; </i>'many 
run to and fro' after it, but it is seldom experimental; the power of 
God is frequently talked of, but rarely felt, and too often cried down 
under the despicable name of <i>frames </i>and <i>feelings. </i>Numbers <i>seek, </i>by
 hearing a variety of Gospel ministers, reading all the religious books 
that are published, learning the best tunes to our hymns, disputing on 
controverted points of doctrine, telling or hearing Church news, and 
listening to, or retailing, spiritual scandal. But, alas! few <i>strive</i> in pangs of heart-felt convictions; few 'deny themselves and take up their cross daily;' few 'take the kingdom of heaven by <i>the holy </i>violence' of wrestling faith, and agonizing prayer; few <i>see, </i>and
 fewer live in 'the kingdom of God, which is righteousness, peace, and 
joy in the Holy Ghost.' In a word, many say, 'Lo! Christ is here; and 
lo! he is there;' but few can consistently witness that <i>'the </i>kingdom of heaven is within them.'  
</p><p align="center">"Many assert that 'the clothing of 
the king's daughter is of wrought gold;' but few, very few experience 
that she is 'all glorious within;' and it is well if many are not bold 
enough to maintain that she is <i>all full of corruptions. </i>With more truth than ever we may say, <br clear="left">
 <br clear="left">
 Ye different sects, who all declare, 
</p><p align="center">Lo! here is Christ, or Christ is there; 
</p><p align="center">Your stronger proofs divinely give,  
</p><p align="center">And show us where <i>the Christians </i>live: 
</p><p align="center">Your claim, alas! ye cannot prove,  
</p><p align="center">Ye want the genuine mark of <i>love.</i> 
</p><p>"The Consequences of this high, and yet lifeless 
profession, are as evident as they are deplorable. Selfish views, 
sinister designs, inveterate prejudice, pitiful bigotry, party spirit, 
self-sufficiency, contempt of others, envy, jealousy, <i>making men offenders for a</i> <i>word</i>,
 -- possibly a Scriptural word too, taking advantage of each other's 
infirmities, magnifying innocent mistakes, putting the worst 
construction upon each other's words and actions, false accusations, 
backbiting, malice, revenge, persecutions, and a hundred such evils, 
prevail among religious people, to the great astonishment of the 
children of the world, and the unspeakable grief of the true Israelites 
that yet remain among us.  
</p><p>"But this is not all. Some of our hearers do not 
even keep to the great outlines of heathen morality not satisfied 
practically to reject Christ's declaration, that 'it is more blessed to 
give than to receive,' they proceed to that pitch of covetousness and 
daring injustice, as not to pay their just debts; <i>yea, </i>and to 
cheat, and to extort, whenever they have a fair opportunity. How few of 
our societies are there where this, or some other evil, has not broken 
out, and given such shakes to the ark of the Gospel, that had not the 
Lord wonderfully interposed, it must long ago have been overset! And you
 know how to this day the name and truth of God are openly blasphemed 
among the baptized heathens, through the Antinomian lives of many, who 
'say they are Jews when they are not, but <i>by their works declare </i>they
 are of the synagogue of Satan.' At your peril, therefore, my brethren, 
countenance them not: I know you would not do it designedly, but you may
 do it unawares; therefore 'take heed,' -- more than ever 'take heed to 
your doctrine.' Let it be Scripturally evangelical: give not the 
children's bread unto dogs: comfort not people that do not mourn. When 
you should give emetics do not administer cordials, and by that means 
strengthen the hands of the slothful and unprofitable servant. I repeat 
it once more, warp not to Antinomianism, and in order to this, <i>take heed, O! take heed to your doctrine."</i>  
</p><p>Surely, sir, there is no harm in this word of 
exhortation; it is Scriptural, and Mr. Wesley's pen cannot make it 
heretical. Take we then heed to the design of the directions which 
follow: -- It is evident, that, in order to keep his fellow laborers 
clear from Antinomianism, he directs them, FIRST, Not to <i>lean too much toward Calvinism; </i>and, SECONDLY, Not to <i>talk of a justified and sanctified state </i>so unguardedly as some, even Arminians do; which <i>tends to mislead men, </i>and relax their watchful attention to their internal and external works, that is, to <i>the whole of their inward tempers and outward behavior. </i>See No. 8.  
</p><p>He produces three particulars, wherein he thinks 
that both he and his assistants in the Lord's vineyard have leaned too 
much toward Calvinism, each of which has a natural and strong tendency 
to countenance the Antinomian delusion. The FIRST: -- Being afraid or 
ashamed to maintain that every man is <i>faithfully </i>to employ his 
every talent; though our Lord himself goes so far in maintaining this 
doctrine, as to declare that 'if a man be not FAITHFUL in the 
unrighteous mammon, God will not give him the true riches.' The SECOND: 
-- Being afraid to use the expression, <i>working for life; </i>although
 our Lord, who must be allowed perfectly to understand his own Gospel, 
uses it himself. And the THIRD: -- Granting, without proper distinction,
 that a man <i>is to do nothing in order to justification, </i>"than 
which," says he, "nothing can be more false;" as common sense dictates, 
that a rebel must lay down his arms before he can receive a pardon from 
his prince.  
</p><p>This being premised, Mr. Wesley invites his fellow laborers <i>to review the whole affair; </i>and
 while he does it, he saps the foundations of the Babels built by those 
who call Christ "Lord! Lord!" without departing from iniquity. <i>Who </i>among Christians, says he, <i>is now accepted of God? </i>Not he, that, like Hymeneus, <i>formerly </i>believed,
 and "concerning faith hath now made shipwreck:" nor he, that, like 
Simon Magus, actually believes with a speculative, Antinomian faith; but
 "he that now believes in Christ with a loving and obedient heart," or, 
as our Lord and St. Paul express it, he whose "faith works by love, and 
whose love keeps God's commandments." This must at once overthrow the 
pretensions of those whose feigned faith, instead of producing a change 
in their hearts, only adds positiveness to their self-conceit, 
bitterness to their bad tempers, and perhaps licentiousness to their 
worldly lives.  
</p><p>Still carrying on his point, he observes next, to the shame of loose Christians, that none <i>are accepted of God </i>even among the heathens, but those <i>that fear him and work righteousness. </i>Nor
 is this observation improper, (you, sir, being judge,) for you tell us 
in your fifth sermon, page 84,* that "Cornelius was a man of singular 
probity, humanity, and morality; and that a view of his character may 
perhaps convince some, who consider themselves as Christians, how far 
short they are even of his imperfect righteousness."  
</p><p>* [London, printed for J. Johnson, 1762.]  
</p><p>This leads him, No. 4, to touch upon an important 
objection, that will naturally occur to the mind of a Protestant; and he
 answers it by standing <i>for the necessity of works, </i>as firmly as he does <i>against their merit </i>in point of <i>salvation; </i>thus
 cutting down, with one truly evangelical stroke, the arrogancy of 
self-righteous Papists, and the delusion of licentious Protestants. And 
lest Antinomians should, from the Protestant doctrine "that good works 
have absolutely no merit in point of salvation," take occasion to slight
 them that live in sin, he very properly observes, No. 6, that believers
 shall be <i>rewarded </i>in heaven, and are even often rewarded on earth, <i>because of their works, </i>and <i>according to their works, </i>which, he apprehends, does not so widely differ from <i>secundum merita operum, </i>as
 Protestants in the heat of their contentions with the Papists have been
 apt to conclude. No. 7, he starts another objection, which Antinomians 
will naturally make to St. Peter's declaration, that God accepts those 
"who fear him and work righteousness."  
</p><p>And now, Hon. sir, reserving for another place the
 consideration of his answer, let me appeal to your candor. From the 
general tenor of these propositions, is it not evident that Mr. Wesley, 
(who is now among Gospel ministers, what St. James formerly was among 
the disciples, and Mr. Baxter among the Puritan divines, that is, the 
person peculiarly commissioned by the Bishop of souls to defend the 
Gospel against the encroachments of Antinomians,) aims at stemming the 
torrent of their delusions, and not at all at "injuring the fundamental 
principles of Christianity," or bringing "a dreadful heresy into the 
Church."  
</p><p>You may reply, that you do not so much consider what he <i>aims </i>at doing, as what he <i>has actually </i>done.
 Nay, sir, the intention is what a candid judge (much more a loving 
brother) should particularly consider. If aiming to kill a wild beast 
that attacks my friend, I unfortunately stab him, it is a "melancholy 
accident;" but he wrongs me much, who represents it as a "dreadful 
barbarity." In like manner, if Mr. Wesley has unhappily wounded the 
truth, in attempting to give the wolf in sheep's clothing a killing 
stroke, his mistake should rather be called "well-meant legality" than <i>dreadful heresy.</i>  
</p><p>You possibly reply, "Let any one look at these 
Minutes, and say, whether all the unawakened clergy in the land would 
not approve and receive them." And what if they did? Would the 
propositions be t  
</p><p>[corrupted text]  
</p><p>orld:" he as the stock of the tree of 
righteousness, and we as the branches, "having our fruit" from him "unto
 holiness," and "some real Protestants, continually harp upon the words 
FREE grace, and FREE will; but he gives reasons of considerable weight 
fo  
</p><p>[corrupted text]  
</p><p>rd will, the freedom of our choice: and he has too much sense to delight in perpetual tautology. (3.) He finds, by bless  
</p><p>[corrupted text]  
</p><p>on, the state of "fathers in Christ," or, the glorious liberty of the children of God;" sometimes "a being strengthened, stabli  
</p><p>[corrupted text]  
</p><p>come to an objection of greater weight:--  
</p><p>"Mr. Wesley contradicts himself. He has hitherto preached salvation by faith, and now he talks of <i>salvation by works, as a condition:</i> he has a thousand times offered a <i>free pardon </i>to the worst of sinners, and now he has the assurance to declare that a <i>man is to do something in order to justification." </i>Where
 will you "find such inconsistencies?" Where! In the Old and New 
Testament, and especially in the epistles of the great preacher of free 
justification, and salvation by faith. There you will see many such <i>seeming </i>inconsistencies as these:<i> -- Eternal life is the gift of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. </i>"Charge
 the rich to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation, that they
 may lay hold on eternal life: we are temperate, to obtain an 
incorruptible crown." <i>By grace ye are saved through faith. </i>"In so doing thou shalt save thyself. Work out your own salvation." <i>We are not sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves. </i>"The Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law." <i>God justifieth the ungodly and him that worketh not. </i>"He
 shall render to every man according to his works, even eternal life to 
them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory." <i>God forbid that I should glory in any thing, save in the cross of Christ. </i>"As the truth of God is in me<i>, </i>no man shall stop me of this glorying," that I have kept myself from being burdensome. <i>I am the chief of sinners. </i>"I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day." <i>We rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. </i>"Our
 rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity 
and godly sincerity we have had our conversation in the world." <i>Not 
by works of righteousness that we have done, but according to his mercy 
he saved us: not of works, lest any man should boast; for if it be of 
works, then it is no more grace, otherwise work is no more work. </i>"I 
keep under my body, lest I myself should be a cast-away: be not 
deceived; whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap: he that 
soweth little shall reap little; he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of 
the Spirit reap life everlasting." <i>I am persuaded that neither death,
 nor life, neither things present nor things to come, &amp;c, shall be 
able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. </i>Those
 that fall away "crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put 
him to an open shame: for the earth which beareth thorns and briers is 
rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned. Some of 
the branches were broken off by unbelief, thou standest by faith; be not
 high minded, but fear; continue in God's goodness, otherwise thou also 
shalt be cut off."  
</p><p>Now, sir, permit me to beg you would lay your hand
 upon your heart, and say, whether malicious infidels have not a fairer 
show of reason to raise wicked men against St. Paul, than you have to 
raise good men against Mr. Wesley? And whether a grain of the candor 
with which you would reconcile the <i>seeming* </i>contradictions of the great apostle would not be more than sufficient to reconcile the <i>seeming </i>inconsistencies of the great minister whom you have so warmly attacked?  
</p><p>* [Most of these seeming inconsistencies of St. 
Paul, and those which are charged upon Mr. Wesley, will be reconciled 
with the greatest ease by considering the two axioms mentioned in my 
first letter. In the former part of the imaginary contradictions those 
servants of God make use of the first Gospel axiom; in the latter part 
they employ the second, and thus declare the whole counsel of God.]  
</p><p>Some persons indeed complain aloud that "Mr. 
Wesley, in his new scheme of salvation by works as a condition, fairly 
renounces Christ's blood and righteousness." I grant that the words 
"blood and righteousness" are not found in the Minutes, but "acceptance 
by believing in Christ" is found there; and he must be a caviller 
indeed, who asserts that he means a Christ without blood, or a Christ 
without righteousness. Beside, when he cuts off <i>the merit of works </i>from
 having any share in our salvation, far from forgetting the meritorious 
life and death of the Redeemer, he effectually guards them, and the 
Protestant ark, sprinkled with the atoning blood, from the rash touches 
of all merit mongers. Add to this, that Mr. Wesley has sufficiently 
declared his faith in the atonement, in thousands of sermons and hymns, 
some of which are continually sung both by him and the <i>real Protestants, </i>so that "out of their own mouth" their groundless charge may be refuted.  
</p><p>Again, the doctrine of the atonement had been 
fully discussed in former conferences and Minutes, and Mr. Wesley is too
 methodical to bring the same thing over and over again; nor is it 
reasonable to expect it should be peculiarly insisted upon in a charge 
against Antinomians, who rather abuse than deny it. Once more: Mr. 
Wesley's extract of the Minutes is a memorandum of what was said in the 
latter part of a conference, or conversation; and no unprejudiced person
 will maintain, that those who do not expressly mention the atonement in
 every conversation do actually renounce it.  
</p><p>To conclude: if the author of the Minutes had 
advanced the following propositions which you have dropped in your 
second sermon, you might have had some reason to suspect his not doing 
the atonement justice, (page 36.) "Christ only did that to the human 
nature which Adam (had he stood upright) would have done." What! sir, 
would Adam have died for his posterity, or did not Christ die for them?<i> </i>You
 add, "See the true reason of his death; that he might subdue the 
earthly life in every sense." And page 45, "He certainly died for no 
other end but that we might receive the Spirit of holiness." Mr. Wesley 
is of a very different sentiment, sir; for, poor heretic! he believes 
with the Papists that "Christ died to make an atonement for us;" and 
with St. John, that "he is the propitiation our sins, and for the sins 
of the whole world." Nevertheless, he will not cry out, <i>Dreadful heresy! </i>though
 he will probably think, that you were once a little too deeply in Mr. 
Law's sentiments. Leaving you to think with how much justice I might 
descant here upon this line of the satiric poet, <i> </i>
</p><p><i>Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas:</i> </p>
<p>I remain, Rev. and dear sir, yours, &amp;c,  </p>
<p>J. FLETCHER.</p>

<h2> LETTER III. </h2>
</p><p>HONOURED AND REVEREND SIR, -- We have seen how 
exceedingly commendable was Mr. Wesley's design in writing what you have
 extracted from his last Minutes; and how far from being unanswerable 
are the <i>general </i>objections which some have moved against them. 
Let us now proceed to a candid inquiry into the true meaning of the 
propositions. They are thus prefaced:--  
</p><p>"We said in 1744, <i>We have leaned too much toward Calvinism. </i>Wherein?"  
</p><p>This single sentence is enough, I grant, to make 
some persons account Mr. Wesley a heretic. He is not a Calvinist! And 
what is still more dreadful, he has the assurance to say that he has <i>leaned too much toward Calvinism! </i>This will sound like a double heresy in their ears; but not in <i>yours, </i>sir,
 who seem to carry your anti-Calvinistical notions farther than Mr. 
Wesley himself. He never spoke more clearly to the point of free grace 
than you do, page 85, of your sermons: -- "God," say you, "never left 
himself without witness, not only from the visible things of the 
creation, but likewise from the inward witness, a spiritual seed of 
light sown in the soul of every son of man, Jew, Turk, or Pagan, as well
 as Christians, whose kindly suscitations whoever follows, will gladly 
perceive increasing gleams still leading farther on to nearer and far 
brighter advances, till at length a foil and perfect day bursts forth 
upon his ravished eyes." In this single sentence, sir, you bear the 
noblest testimony to all the doctrines in which Mr. Wesley dissents from
 the Calvinists. You begin with GENERAL REDEMPTION, and end with 
PERFECTION: or, to use your own expression, you follow him "from the 
spiritual seed of light in a Turk," quite to the "full and perfect day, 
bursting forth upon the ravished eyes of the Pagan who follows the 
kindly suscitations" of Divine grace.  
</p><p>And far from making man a mere machine, you tell 
us, page 140, "it is true that faith is the gift of God, but the 
exertion of that faith, when once given, lieth in <i>ourselves." </i>Mr. Wesley grants it, sir; but permit me to tell you that the word <i>ourselves </i>being printed in italics, seems to<i> </i>convey
 rather more anti-Calvinism than he holds: for he is persuaded that we 
cannot exert faith without a continual influence of the same Divine 
power that produced it; it being evident, upon the Gospel plan, that 
"without Christ we can do nothing." From these and the like passages in 
your sermons, I conclude, sir, that your charge of <i>dreadful heresy </i>does
 not rest upon these words, "We have leaned too much toward Calvinism." 
Pass we then to the next, in which Mr. Wesley begins to show wherein he 
has consented too much to the Calvinists.  
</p><p>"I. With regard to <i>man's faithfulness </i>Our 
Lord himself taught us to use the expression. And we ought never to be 
ashamed of it. We ought steadily to assert, on his authority, that if a 
man 'is not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, God will not give him 
the true riches.'"  
</p><p>Now, where does the heresy lie here? Is it in the word <i>man's faithfulness? </i>Is there so much <i>faithfulness </i>to God and man among professors, that he must be <i>opposed </i>by all good men who dares to use the bare word? Do <i>real Protestants </i>account
 "man's faithfulness" a grace of supererogation, and quoting Scripture a
 heresy? Or do they slight what our Lord recommends in the plainest 
terms, and will one day reward in the most glorious manner? If not, why 
are they going to enter a protest against Mr. Wesley because he is "not 
ashamed of Christ and his words before an evil and adulterous 
generation," and will not "keep back" from his immense flock any part of
 the counsel of God," much less a part that so many professors overlook,
 while some are daring enough to lampoon it, and others wicked enough to
 trample it under foot?  
</p><p>O, sir, if Mr. Wesley is to be cast out of your synagogue unless he <i>formally recant </i>the
 passage he has quoted, and which be says "we are not to be ashamed of;"
 what will you do to the Son of God who spoke it? What to St. Luke who 
wrote it? And what to good Mr. Henry who thus comments upon it? "If we 
do not make a right use of the gifts of God's providence, how can we 
expect from him those present and future comforts which are the gifts of
 his spiritual grace? Our Savior here compares these; and shows that 
though our faithful use of the things of this world cannot be thought to
 merit any favor at the hand of god, yet our unfaithfulness in the use 
of them may be justly reckoned a <i>forfeiture </i>of that grace which 
is necessary to bring us to glory. And that is it which our Savior 
shows, Luke xvi, 10-12, He that is unjust, <i>unfaithful, </i>in the least, is unjust, unfaithful also in <i>much. </i>The riches of this world are the less; grace and glory are the <i>greater. </i>Now,
 if we be unfaithful in the less, if we use the things of this world to 
other purposes than those to which they were given us, it may justly be 
feared we shall be so in the gifts of God's grace, that we will receive 
them also in vain, and therefore they will be denied us. He that is 
faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much. He that 
serves God and does good with his money, will serve God and do good with
 the more noble and valuable talents of wisdom and grace, and spiritual 
gifts, and the earnests of heaven: but he that buries the one talent of 
this world's wealth, will never improve the five talents of spiritual 
riches."  
</p><p>Thus speaks the honest commentator: and whoever 
charges him with legality or heresy therein, I must express my 
approbation by a shout of applause. Hail Henry! hail Wesley! Ye faithful
 servants of the most high God. Stand it out against an Antinomian 
world! Hail ye followers of the despised Galilean! You "confess him and 
his words before a perverse generation, he will confess you before his 
Father and his angels." Let not the scoffs, let not the accusations even
 of good people, led by the tempter appearing as an angel of light, make
 you give up one jot or tittle of your Lord's Gospel. Though thousands 
should combine to brand you as legalists, Papists, heretics, and 
anti-christs stand it out: Scripture, conscience, and Jesus are on your 
side. "Be not afraid of their terror, but sanctify the Lord God in your 
hearts." And when you shall have <i>occupied </i>a little longer, and 
been a little more abused by your mistaken companions, your master will 
come and find you employed in serving his family, and not in "beating 
your fellow servants." And while the unprofitable, unfaithful, 
quarrelsome servant is cast out, he will address you with a "well done 
good and faithful servants! Ye have been faithful over a few things; I 
will make you rulers over many things. Enter into the joy of your Lord."  
</p><p>Excuse the length of this address: it dropped from
 me before I was aware, and is the fruit of the joy I feel to see "the 
John Goodwin of the age," and the oracle of the Calvinists so fully 
agree to maintain the Christian <i>heresy </i>against the Antinomian 
orthodoxy. Nay, and you yourself are of the very same way of thinking. 
For you tell us (page 89) "that God so far approved of the advances 
Cornelius had made toward him," (by praying, and giving, as you had 
observed before, much alms to the people,) "under the slender light 
offered him; of his earnest desire of a still nearer and more intimate 
acquaintance with him; and of the improvements he had made of the small 
talent he had committed to him; that he was now about to entrust him 
with greater and far better treasures."  
</p><p>In the mouth of two such witnesses as Mr. Henry 
and yourself, Mr. Wesley's doctrine might be established; but as I fear 
that some of our friends will soon look upon you both as tainted with 
his heresy, I shall produce some plain Scripture instances to prove, by 
the strongest of all arguments, <i>matter of fact, </i>that man's "unfaithfulness in the mammon of unrighteousness" is attended with the worst of consequences.  
</p><p>You know, sir, what destruction this sin brought 
upon Achan, and by his means upon Israel: and you remember how Saul's 
avarice, and his "flying upon the spoil of the Amalekites" cost him his 
kingdom, together with the Divine blessing. You will, perhaps, object 
that "they forfeited only temporal mercies." True, if they repented; but
 if their sin sealed up the hardness of their heart, then they lost all.  
</p><p>I can, however, mention two who indisputably 
forfeited both spiritual and eternal blessings: the one is the moral 
young man whose fatal attachment to wealth is mentioned in the Gospel. 
"Go," said our Lord to him, "sell all thou hast, give to the poor; come,
 follow me, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven." He was unfaithful 
in the "mammon of unrighteousness;" he would not comply with the 
proposal, and though "Jesus loved him," yet he stood firm to his word, 
he did not "give him the true riches." The unhappy wretch chose to have 
his good things in this world, and so lost them in the next.  
</p><p>The other instance is Judas. "He left all," at 
first, "to follow Jesus;" but when the devil placed him upon the high 
mountain of temptation, and showed him the horrors of poverty and the 
alluring wealth of this world, covetousness, his besetting sin, 
prevailed again: and as he carried the bag he turned thief, and made a 
private purse. You know, sir, that "the love of money" proved to him 
"the root of all evil;" and that on account of his "unfaithfulness in 
the mammon of unrighteousness" our Lord not only did "not give him the 
true riches," but took his every talent from him, his apostleship on 
earth, and one of the twelve thrones which he had promised him in common
 with the other disciples.  
</p><p>Some, I know, will excuse Judas by fathering his crime and damnation upon the decrees of God. But we who are not numbered among <i>real Protestants </i>think
 that sinners are reprobated as they are elected, that is, says St. 
Peter, "according to the foreknowledge of God." We are persuaded that 
because God's knowledge is <i>infinite </i>he foreknows future 
contingencies; and we think we should insult both his holiness and his 
omniscience if we did not believe that he could both foresee and 
foretell that Judas would be unfaithful, without necessitating him to be
 so, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. We assert, then, that as 
Jesus loved the poor covetous young man, so he loved his poor covetous 
disciple. For had he hated him, he must have acted the base part of a 
dissembler, by showing him for years as much love as he did the other 
apostles; an idea too horrid for a Christian to entertain, I shall not 
say of "God made flesh," but even of a man that has any sincerity or 
truth! Judas's damnation, therefore, and the ruin of the young man, 
according to the second axiom in the Gospel, were merely of themselves, 
by their unbelief and "unfaithfulness in the mammon of unrighteousness:"
 for "how could they believe," seeing they reposed their "trust in 
uncertain riches!"  
</p><p>Thus, sir, both the express declaration of our 
Lord, and the plain histories of the Scripture agree to confirm this 
fundamental principle in Christianity, that when God works upon man he 
expects faithfulness from man; and that when man, as a moral agent, 
grieves and quenches the Spirit that strives to make him faithful, 
temporal and eternal ruin are the inevitable consequence.  
</p><p>Thus far, then, the Minutes contain a great, 
evangelical truth, and not a shadow of heresy. Let us see whether the 
dreadful snake lurks under the second proposition.  
</p><p>"II. We have leaned too much toward Calvinism; (2.) With regard to <i>working for life. </i>This also our Lord has expressly commanded us. <i>Labor </i>(Ergazesqe, literally, <i>work) for the meat </i>that <i>endureth to everlasting life. </i>And in fact every believer, till he comes to glory, works <i>for </i>as well as <i>from </i>life."  
</p><p>Here Mr. Wesley strikes at a fatal mistake of all 
Antinomians, many honest Calvinists, and not a few who are Arminians in 
sentiment, and Calvinists in practice. All these, when they see that man
 is by nature dead in trespasses and sins, lie easy in the mire of 
iniquity, idly waiting till, by an irresistible act of omnipotence, God 
pulls them out without any striving on their part. Multitudes 
uncomfortably stick here, and will probably continue to do so till they 
receive and heartily embrace that part of the Gospel which is now, alas 
called <i>heresy. </i>When shall these poor prisoners in giant Despair's
 castle find the key of their dungeon about them, and perceive that "the
 word is nigh them, yea, in their mouth and in their heart; stirring up 
the gift of God within them, and in hope believing against hope," they 
will happily "lay hold on eternal life, and apprehend," by the 
confidence of faith, "him that has apprehended them" by convictions of 
sin.  
</p><p>But now, instead of imitating Lazarus, who, when 
the Lord had called him and restored life to his putrefying body, "came 
forth" out of his grave, though he was "bound hand and foot;" these 
mistaken men indolently wait till the Lord drags them out, not 
considering that it is more than he has promised to do. On the contrary,
 he reproves by<i> </i>his prophet, those that "do not stir themselves 
up to lay hold on him;" and deciding the point himself, says, "Turn ye 
at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you; because I 
called and ye refused, I stretched out my hands unto you, and no man 
regarded, I will mock when your fear cometh."  
</p><p>Should you object, "that the case is not similar, because the Lord gave life to the dead body of Lazarus, whereas our souls are <i>dead in sin by nature." </i>True, sir, <i>by nature; </i>but does not <i>"grace </i>reign"
 to control nature? And "as by the offence of one, judgment came upon 
all men to condemnation; even so, by the righteousness of one, is not 
the free gift come upon all men to justification of life?" According to 
the promise made to our first parents, and of course to all men then 
contained in their loins, is not "the seed of the woman <i>always </i>nigh,"
 both to reveal and "bruise the serpent's head?" Is not Christ "the 
light of men, -- the light of the world, -- come into the world? Shineth
 he not in the darkness of our nature, even when the darkness 
comprehends him not? And is not this "light the life," the spiritual 
"life of men?" Can this be denied, if the "light is Christ," and if 
"Christ is the resurrection and the life," who came that "we might have 
life, and that we might have it more abundantly?"  
</p><p>In this Scriptural view of free grace, what room 
is there for the ridiculous cavil that "Mr. Wesley wants the dead to 
work for life?" God, of his infinite mercy in Jesus Christ, gives to <i>poor </i>sinners, naturally dead in sin, <i>a talent </i>of
 free, preventing, quickening grace, which "reproves them of sin;" and 
when it is followed, of "righteousness and judgment." This, which some 
Calvinists call <i>common grace, </i>is granted to all without any 
respect of persons; so that even the poor Jew, Herod, if he had not 
preferred the smiles of his Herodias to the convincing light of Christ 
which shone in his conscience, would have been saved as well as John the
 Baptist; and that poor heathen, Felix, if he had not hardened his heart
 in the day of his visitation, would have sweetly experienced that 
Christ had as much tasted death for him as he did for St. Paul. The 
living light visited them; but they, not "working while it was day," or 
refusing to "cut off the right hand," which the Lord called for, fell at
 last into that "night wherein no man can work; their candlestick was 
removed, their lamp went out." They quenched their "smoking flax," or, 
in other words, <i>their talent </i>unimproved was justly "taken from 
them." Thus, though once through grace they could work, they died while 
they lived; and so were, as says St. Jude, "twice dead," <i>dead </i>in Adam by that sentence, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;" and <i>dead </i>in themselves, by personally renouncing Christ the life, or rejecting the light of his convincing Spirit.  
</p><p>This being premised, I ask, Where is the <i>heresy </i>in
 this paragraph of the Minutes? Does it consist in quoting a plain 
passage out of one of our Lord's sermons? Or in daring to produce in the
 original, under the horrible form of the decagrammaton, Ergazesqe, that
 dreadful tetragrammaton, <i>work? </i>Surely, sir, you have too much 
piety to maintain the former, and too much good sense to assert the 
latter. Does it consist in saying that <i>"believers </i>work <i>from life?</i>" (for of such only Mr. Wesley here speaks.) Do not all grant that <i>he who believeth hath life, </i>yea, <i>everlasting life, </i>and
 therefore can work? And have I not proved from Scripture that the very 
heathens are not without some light and grace to work suitably to their 
dispensation?  
</p><p>"The heresy," say you, "does not consist in asserting that the believer works <i>from, </i>but <i>for </i>life!" Does it indeed? Then the Lord Jesus is the <i>heretic; </i>for Mr. Wesley only repeats what he spoke about seventeen hundred years ago: "Labor," says he, Ergazesqe<i>, </i>"work
 for the meat that endureth to everlasting life." Enter therefore "your 
protest against" St. John's Gospel, if Christ will not "formally recant 
it;" and not against the Minutes of his servant who dares not "take away
 from his Lord's words," for fear "God should take away his part out of 
the book of life!"  
</p><p>But if the Son of God be a heretic for putting the unbelieving Jews upon <i>working </i>by<i> </i>that
 dreadful word, Ergazesqe, St. Paul is undoubtedly an archheretic for 
corroborating it by a strong preposition: Katergazesqe says he to the 
Philippians, <i>work</i> <i>out</i> -- and what is most astonishing, "work out your own salvation." Your <i>own Salvation! </i>Why, Paul, this is even worse than <i>working for life; </i>for <i>salvation </i>implies
 a deliverance from all guilt, sin, and misery; together with obtaining 
the life of grace here, and the life of glory hereafter. Ah! poor legal 
apostle, what a pity is it thou didst not live in our evangelical age! 
Some, by explaining to thee the mystery of finished salvation," or by 
"protesting in a body against thy dreadful heresy," might have saved 
"the fundamental doctrines of Christianity;" and the Richard Baxter of 
our age would not have had thee to bear him out in his Pharisaical and 
Papistical delusions!  
</p><p>Here you reply, that "St. Paul gives God all the 
glory, by maintaining that 'it is he who works in us both to will and to
 do of his good pleasure.'" And does not Mr. Wesley do the same? Has he 
not for near forty years steadily asserted that all power to think a 
good thought, much more to will or do a good work, is from God, by mere 
grace, through the merits of Jesus Christ and the agency of the Holy 
Spirit? If any dare to deny it, myriads of witnesses who have heard him 
preach, and thousands of printed sermons, hymns, and tracts dispersed 
through the three kingdoms will prove it.  
</p><p>But let us come closer to the point. Is not Christ
 "the bread that came down from heaven to give life to the world?" Is he
 not "the meat that endureth to everlasting life?" "the meat which" he 
directs even the poor Capernaites "to work for?" Must we not <i>come </i>to
 him for that meat? Is not "coming" to Christ a "work" of the heart? 
Yea, "the work of God?" The work that God peculiarly calls for? John vi,
 28, 29. Does not our Lord complain of those who will not work for life,
 that is, "come unto him that they might have life, or that they might 
have it more abundantly?" And must not every believer "do this work" -- 
come to Christ for life, yea, and live upon him every day and every 
hour?  
</p><p>Again, sir, consider these scriptures, "he that 
believeth hath everlasting life: he that hath the Son hath life." 
Compare them with the following complaint: "None stirreth up himself to 
lay hold on God and with the charge of St. Paul to Timothy, "Lay hold on
 eternal life." And let us know whether "stirring up one's self to lay 
hold on God of our life," and actually "laying hold on eternal life," 
are not "works," and works <i>for, </i>as well as <i>from </i>life! And whether believers are dispensed from these works till they come to glory!  
</p><p>Once more: please to tell us if praying, using 
ordinances, "running a race, taking up the cross, keeping under the 
body, wrestling fighting a good fight," are not works; and if all 
believers are not to do them till death brings them a discharge? If you 
say that "they do them <i>from</i> life and not <i>for </i>life," you still point blank oppose our Lord's express declaration.  
</p><p>A similar instance will make you sensible of it. 
Lot flies out Sodom. How many works does he do at once! He hearkens 
God's messengers, obeys their voice, sacrifices his property, forsakes 
all, prays, runs, and "escapes for his life." "No," says one, "wiser 
than seven men who can render a reason," "you should not say that he 
escapes <i>for </i>life, but <i>from </i>life. Do not hint that he runs <i>to preserve his life; </i>you should say that he does it <i>because he is alive." </i>What an admirable distinction is this!  
</p><p>Again: my friend is consumptive. I send for a physician who prescribes, "he must ride out every day <i>for </i>his
 life." Some other physicians see the prescription, and, by printed 
letters, raise all the gentlemen of the faculty to insist in a body on a
 formal recantation of this dreadful prescription; declaring the health 
of thousands is at stake, if we say that consumptive people are to ride <i>for </i>life as well as <i>from </i>life. <i>Risum teneatis, amici?</i>  
</p><p>But they who protest against Mr. Wesley for maintaining that we ought to work <i>for, </i>as well as <i>from </i>life,
 must protest also against a body of Puritan divines, who, in the last 
century, being shocked at Dr. Crisp's doctrine, thus bore their 
testimony against it: "To say, <i>Salvation is not th</i>e <i>end of any good work we do, </i>or <i>we are to act </i>FROM <i>life, and not </i>FOR <i>life, </i>were
 to abandon the human nature; it were to teach us to violate the great 
precepts of the Gospel; it supposes one bound to do more for the 
salvation of others than our own; it were to make all the threatenings 
of eternal death, and promises of eternal life in the Gospel, useless, 
as motives to shun the one, or obtain the other: and it makes the 
Scripture characters and commendation of the most eminent saints, a 
fault:" for they all escaped out of Sodom or Babylon for their lives; 
they all wrestled for, and "laid hold on eternal life." <i>(Preface to Mr. Flavel's Book against Antinomianism.)</i>  
</p><p>Thus, sir, the very Calvinists were ashamed a hundred years ago of the grand Crispian tenet, "that we ought not to work <i>for </i>life."  
</p><p>And I am glad to find you are as far from this 
error as they were; for you tell us in your sermons, page 69, that "the 
gracious end of Christ's coming into the world was to give eternal <i>life </i>to those who were <i>dead </i>in
 sins; and that eternal life does consist in knowing the true God, and 
Jesus Christ whom he hath sent." You assure us next, that this life 
begins by "an exploring desire;" and that God, by giving it, "only means
 to be earnestly sought, that he may be more successfully and more 
happily found."  
</p><p>Perhaps some suppose the expression of working <i>for </i>life implies the working in order to <i>merit </i>or <i>purchase </i>life.
 But, as our Lord's words convey no such idea, so Mr. Wesley takes care 
positively to exclude it, by those words, "not by the merit of works:" 
for he knows that "eternal life is the gift of God;" and yet with St. 
Paul he says, "Labor to enter into rest, lest ye fall after the example 
of Israel's unbelief:" and with the great anti-Crispian divine, Jesus 
Christ, he cries aloud, "Strive <i>to walk </i>in the narrow way; agonize to enter in at the strait gate that leads to life."  
</p><p>I pass to the third instance which he produces of his having leaned too much toward Calvinism: --  
</p><p>"III. We have received it as a maxim, <i>that a man is to do nothing in order to justification. </i>Nothing
 can be more false. Whoever desires to find favor with God, should 
'cease from evil, and learn to do well.' Whoever repents, should 'do 
works meet for repentance.' And if this be not <i>in order </i>to find favor, what does he do them for?"  
</p><p>To do Mr. Wesley justice, it is necessary to 
consider what he means by "justification." And, First, He does not mean 
that general benevolence of our merciful God toward sinful mankind, 
whereby, through the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, he 
casts a propitious look upon them, and freely makes them partakers of 
"the light that enlightens every man that cometh into the world." This 
general loving kindness is certainly previous to any thing we can do to 
find it; for it always prevents us, saying to us in our very infancy, <i>Live; </i>and
 when we turn from the paths of life, still crying, "Why will ye die?" 
In consequence of this general mercy, our Lord says, "Let little 
children come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven." Much less 
does Mr. Wesley understand what Dr. Crisp calls "eternal justification,"
 which, because I do not see it in the Scripture, I shall say nothing 
of.  
</p><p>But the "justification" he speaks of, as something
 that we must "find," and "in order to which something must be done," is
 either <i>that public and final </i>JUSTIFICATION <i>which the Lord mentions in the Gospel, </i>"By
 thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be 
condemned." And in this sense no man in his wits will find fault with 
Mr. Wesley's assertion; as it is evident that we must absolutely "do 
something," that is, speak good words, in order to he "justified by our 
words." Or he means FORGIVENESS, <i>and the </i>WITNESS <i>of it; </i>that
 wonderful transaction of the Spirit of God, in a returning prodigal's 
conscience, by which the forgiveness of his sin is proclaimed to him 
through the blood of sprinkling. This is what Mr. Wesley and St. Paul 
generally mean. It is thus that "being justified by faith we have peace 
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."  
</p><p>And now, do not Scripture, common sense, and 
experience, show that "something must be done in order to attain or 
find," though not to <i>merit </i>and <i>purchase </i>this justification?  
</p><p>Please to answer the following questions founded 
upon the express declarations of God's word: -- "To him that ordereth 
his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God." Is "ordering 
our conversation aright," doing nothing? "Repent ye, and be converted, 
that your sins may he blotted out." Are "repentance and conversion" 
nothing? "Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you
 rest," I will justify you. Is "coming" doing nothing? "Cease to do 
evil, learn to do well. Come now, let us reason together, and though 
your sins be red as crimson they shall be white as snow," you shall he 
justified. Is "ceasing to do evil and learning to do well," doing 
nothing? "Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is
 near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his 
thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon 
him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Is "seeking, 
calling, forsaking one's way, and returning to the Lord," a mere 
nothing? "Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, 
and it shall be opened unto you." Be "violent, take even the kingdom of 
heaven by force." Is "seeking, asking, knocking, and taking by force," 
doing absolutely nothing? Please do answer these questions; and when you
 have done, I will throw one or two hundred more of the like kind in 
your way.  
</p><p>Let us now see whether reason is not for Mr. Wesley as well as Scripture. Do you not maintain that <i>believing </i>is necessary in order to our justification? If you do, you subscribe Mr. Wesley's <i>heresy; </i>for
 "believing" is not only "doing something," but necessarily supposes "a 
variety of things." "Faith cometh by hearing," and sometimes <i>by reading, </i>which
 implies "attending the ministry of the word, and searching the 
Scriptures," as the Bereans did. It likewise presupposes at least "the 
attention of the mind, and consent of the heart to a revealed truth;" or
 "the consideration, approbation, and receiving of an object proposed to
 us." Nay, it implies "renouncing worldly, and seeking Divine honor." 
For, says our Lord, "How can you believe who receive honor one of 
another, and seek not the honor that cometh of God only?" And if none 
can believe in Christ unto salvation but those who give up seeking 
worldly honors, by a pant of reason they must give up following fleshly 
lusts, and putting their trust in uncertain riches. In a word, they must
 own themselves sick, and renounce their physicians of no value, before 
they can make one true application to the invaluable Physician. What a 
variety of things is, therefore, implied in "believing," which we cannot
 but acknowledge to be previous to justification! Who can then, 
consistently with reason, blame Mr. Wesley for saying <i>"something </i>must be done in order to justification?"  
</p><p>Again, if nothing be required of us in order to 
justification, who can find fault with those that die in a state of 
condemnation? They were "born in sin, and children of wrath," and 
nothing was required of them in order to find favor. It remains, 
therefore, that they are -- damned, through an absolute decree, made 
thousands of years before they had any existence! If some can swallow 
this camel with the greatest ease, I doubt, sir, it will not go down 
with <i>you, </i>without bearing very hard upon the knowledge you have of the God of love, and the Gospel of Jesus.  
</p><p>Once more: Mr. Wesley concludes his proposition with a very pertinent question: "When a man that is not justified, 'does works <i>meet </i>for repentance,' <i>what does he do them for?</i>" Permit me to answer it according to Scripture and common sense. If he do them in order to <i>purchase </i>the Divine favor, he is under a self-righteous delusion; but if he do them as Mr. Wesley says, "in order to <i>find" </i>what Christ has purchased for him, he acts the part of a wise Protestant.  
</p><p>Should you say that "such a penitent does works 
meet for repentance from a sense of gratitude for redeeming love:" I 
answer, this is impossible; for that "love must be shed abroad in his 
heart by the Holy Ghost given unto him," in consequence of his 
justification, before he can act from the sense of that love and the 
gratitude which it excites. I hope it is no heresy to maintain that the 
cause must go before the effect. I conclude, then, that those who have 
not yet found the pardoning love of God, do works meet for repentance 
"in order to <i>find </i>it." They abstain from those outward evils 
which once they pursued; they do the outward good which the convincing 
Spirit prompts them to: they use the means of grace, confess their sins,
 and ask pardon for them; in short, they "seek" the Lord, encouraged by 
that promise, "they that seek me early shall find me." And Mr. Wesley 
supposes they <i>"seek </i>in order to <i>find." </i>In the name of candor, where is the harm of that supposition?  
</p><p>When the poor woman has lost her "piece of silver,
 she lights a candle," says our Lord, "she sweeps the house, and 
searches diligently till she find it." Mr. Wesley asks, "If she do not 
do all this <i>in order to find it, </i>what does she do it for?" At 
this the alarm is taken; and the post carries, through various 
provinces, printed letters against old Mordecai; and a synod is called 
together to <i>protest </i>against the dreadful error!  
</p><p>This reminds me of a little anecdote. Some 
centuries ago, one Virgilius, I think, a German bishop, was bold enough 
to look over the walls of ignorance and superstition which then enclosed
 all Europe; and he saw, that if the earth was round there must be <i>antipodes. </i>Some
 minutes of his observations were sent to the pope. His holiness, who 
understood geography as much as divinity, took fright, fancying the 
unheard-of assertion was injurious to the very fundamental principles of
 Christianity. He directly called together the cardinals, as wise as 
himself; and by their advice, issued out a bull condemning the heretical
 doctrine, and the poor bishop was obliged to make a formal recantation 
of it, under pain of excommunication. Which are we to admire most? The 
zeal of the conclave, or that of the <i>real Protestants? </i>In the meantime let me observe, that as all the Roman Catholics do now acknowledge that there are <i>antipodes, </i>so all real Protestants will one day acknowledge that penitents seek the favor of God <i>in order to find it; </i>unless some rare genius should be able to demonstrate that it is <i>in order to lose it.</i>  
</p><p>Having defended Mr. Wesley's third proposition 
from Scripture and common sense, permit me to do it also from 
experience. And here I might appeal to the most established persons in 
Mr. Wesley's societies: but as their testimony may have little weight 
with you, I waive it, and appeal to all the accounts of <i>sound </i>conversions
 that have been published since Calvin's days. Show me one, sir, wherein
 it appears that a mourner in Sion found the above described 
justification, without<i> doing </i>some previous "works meet for repentance." If you cannot produce one such instance, Mr. Wesley's doctrine is supported by the <i>printed experiences </i>of
 all the converted Calvinists, as well as of all the believers in his 
own societies. Nor am I afraid to appeal even to the experience of your 
own friends. If any one of these can say, with a good conscience, that 
he found the above described justification without first stopping in the
 career of outward sin, without praying, seeking, and confessing his 
guilt and misery, I promise to give up the Minutes. But if none can make
 such a declaration, you must grant, sir, that experience is on Mr. 
Wesley's side, as much as reason, revelation, the best Calvinists, and 
yourself. I say <i>yourself:</i>  
</p><p>Give me leave to produce but one instance: page <i>76 </i>of
 your sermons, you address those "who see themselves destitute of that 
knowledge of God which is eternal life," the very same thing that Mr. 
Wesley calls justification; and which you define, "a home-felt knowledge
 of God, by the experience of his <i>love </i>being <i>shed abroad in 
our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us: the Spirit of God bearing 
witness with our spirits that we are the children of God;</i>" and you recommend to them "to <i>seek </i>and <i>press </i>after it." Now, sir, "seeking and pressing after it" is certainly "doing something in order to find it."  
</p><p>I must not conclude my vindication of the third proposition without answering a specious objection. "If we must do something <i>in order to justification, </i>farewell <i>free </i>justification!
 It is no more of grace, but of works, and consequently of debt. The 
middle wall of partition between the Church of Rome and the Church of 
England is pulled down, and the two sticks in the hands of that 
heretical juggler, John Wesley, are become one."  
</p><p>I reply, (1.) That some, who think they are <i>real </i>pillars
 in the Protestant Church, may be nearer the Church of Rome than they 
are aware of: for Rome is far more remarkable for lording it over God's 
heritage, and calling the most faithful servants of God <i>heretics, </i>than even for her Pharisaic exalting of good works. (2.) If the Church of Rome had not insisted upon the necessity of <i>unrequired, unprofitable, and foolish works; </i>and if she had not arrogantly ascribed <i>saving merit </i>to
 works, yea, to merely external performances, and by that means clouded 
the merits of Christ; no reasonable Protestant would have separated from
 her on account of her regard for works. (3.) Nothing can be more absurd
 than to affirm, that when "something is required to be done in order to
 receive a favor, the favor loses the name of <i>a free gift, </i>and directly becomes a <i>debt." </i>Long,
 too long, persons who have more honesty than wisdom, have been 
frightened from the plain path of duty, by a phantom of their own 
making. O may the snare break at last! And why should it not break <i>now? </i>Have not sophisms been wire-drawn, till they break of themselves in the sight of every attentive spectator?  
</p><p>I say to two beggars, "Hold out your hand; here is
 an alms for you." The one complies, and the other refuses. Who in the 
world will dare to say that my charity is no more <i>a free gift, </i>because I bestow it only upon the man that held out his hand? Will nothing make it <i>free </i>but
 my wrenching his hand open, or forcing my bounty down his throat? 
Again: the king says to four rebels, "Throw down your arms; surrender, 
and you shall have a place both in my favor and at court." One of them 
obeys, and becomes a great man; the others, upon refusal, are caught and
 hanged. What sophister will face me down that the pardon and place of 
the former are not <i>freely </i>bestowed upon him, because he did something in order to obtain them? Once more:  
</p><p>The God of providence says, "If you plough, sow, 
harrow, fence, and weed your fields, I will give the increase, and you 
shall have a crop." Farmers obey: and are they to believe that because 
they do so many things toward their harvest, it is <i>not the free gift </i>of
 Heaven? Do not all those who fear God know that their ground, seed, 
cattle, strength, yea, and their very life, are the gifts of God? Does 
not this prevent their claiming a crop as a <i>debt; </i>and make them confess, that though it was suspended on their ploughing, &amp;c, it is <i>the unmerited bounty of Heaven?</i>  
</p><p>Apply this, sir, to the present case; and you will see that our <i>doing something in order to justification </i>does not in the least hinder it from being a <i>free gift; </i>because
 whatever we do in order to it, we do it "by the grace of God" 
preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we
 have that good will; all being of free, most absolutely free grace 
through the merits of Christ. And, nevertheless, so sure as a farmer, in
 the appointed ways of Providence, shall have no harvest if he does 
nothing toward it; a professor in the appointed ways of grace, (let him <i>talk </i>of
 "finished salvation" all the year round,) shall go without 
justification and salvation, unless he do something toward them. (My 
comparison is Scriptural:) "He that now goeth on his way weeping," says 
the psalmist, "and beareth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again 
with joy, and bring his sheaves with him." "Be not deceived," says the 
apostle, "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap; and he <i>only </i>that
 soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." David,
 therefore, and St. Paul must be proved enemies to free grace before Mr.
 Wesley can be represented as such: for they both did something in order
 to justification; they both "sowed in tears," before they "reaped in 
joy;" their doctrine and experience went hand in hand together.  
</p><p>Having now vindicated the three first propositions
 of the Minutes, leveled at three dangerous tenets of Dr. Crisp; and 
shown, that not only yourself, sir, but moderate Calvinists are, so far,
 entirely of Mr. Wesley's sentiment; I remain, honored and reverend sir,
 your obedient servant in the bonds of a free and peaceful Gospel,  
</p><p>J. FLETCHER.</p>

<h2>LETTER IV. </h2>
<p>HONOURED AND REVEREND Sir, -- If the three first 
propositions of the Minutes are Scriptural, Mr. Wesley may well begin 
the remaining part, by desiring the preachers in his connection to 
emerge, along with him, from under the noisy billows of prejudice, and 
to struggle quite out of the muddy streams of Antinomian delusions which
 have so long gone over our heads, and carried so many souls down the 
channels of vice, into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone. 
Well may he entreat them to "review the whole affair."  
</p><p>And why should this modest request alarm any one? Though error dreads a revisal, truth, you know, cannot but gain by it.  
</p><p>Mr. Wesley says in this REVIEW,  
</p><p>"I. Who is now accepted of God? He that now believes in Christ with a loving, obedient heart."  
</p><p>Excellent answer! Worthy of St. Paul and St. 
James; for it sums up in one line the epistles of both. In the FIRST 
part of it, ("he that now believes in Christ,") you see St. Paul's 
Gospel calculated for lost sinners, who now fly from the Babel of self 
righteousness and sin, and find "all things" in Christ "ready" for their
 reception. And in the second part, ("with a loving and obedient 
heart,") you see the strong bulwark raised by St. James to guard the 
truth of the Gospel against the attacks of Antinomian and Laodicean 
professors. Had he said, "he that shall believe the next hour is <i>now </i>accepted,"
 he would have bestowed upon present unbelief the blessing that is 
promised to present faith. had he said, "He that believed a year ago is <i>now </i>accepted
 of God," he would have opened the kingdom of heaven to apostates, 
contrary to St. Paul's declarations to the Hebrews. He therefore very 
properly says, "He that <i>now </i>believes:" for it is written, "He that believeth," (not he that <i>shall </i>believe, or he that <i>did </i>believe,) "hath everlasting life."  
</p><p>What fault can you then find with Mr. Wesley here?
 Surely you cannot blame him for proposing Christ as the object of the 
Christian's faith, or for saying that the <i>believer </i>hath a loving and obedient heart; for he speaks of the <i>accepted man, </i>and not of him who <i>comes for acceptance. </i>Multitudes, alas! rest satisfied with an <i>unloving, disobedient </i>faith;
 a faith that engages only the head, but has nothing to do with the 
heart; a faith that works by malice instead of" working by love;" a 
faith that pleads for sin in the heart, instead of purifying the heart 
from sin; a faith that St. Paul explodes, 1 Cor. xiii, 2, and that St. 
James compares to a carcass, ii, 26. There is no need that Mr. Wesley 
should countenance such a faith by his Minutes. Too many, alas! do it by
 their lives; and, God grant none may do it by their sermons! Whoever 
does, sir, it is not you: for you tell us in yours, page 150, that 
"Christ is to be found only by living faith; even a faith that worketh 
by love; even a faith that layeth hold of Christ by the feet, and 
worshippeth him;" the very faith of Mary Magdalene, who certainly had a 
loving and obedient heart, for our Lord testified that "she loved much,"
 and ardent love cannot but be zealously <i>obedient. </i>There is not 
then the least shadow of heresy, but the very marrow of the Gospel in 
this article. Let us see whether the second is equally defensible.  
</p><p>"II. But who among those that never heard of 
Christ? He that feareth God and worketh righteousness, according to the 
light he has."  
</p><p>And where is the error here? Did not St. Peter 
begin his evangelical sermon to Cornelius by these very words, prefaced 
by some others that make them remarkably emphatical? "Of a truth I 
perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he 
that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of him." Surely, 
sir, you will never insist upon a formal recantation of a plain 
scripture.  
</p><p>FIRST OBJECTION. But perhaps you object to those 
words which Mr. Wesley has added to St. Peter's declaration, "according 
to the light he hath."  
</p><p>ANSWER. What, should it be "according to the light he has <i>not?</i>"
 Are not there people enough among us who follow the wicked servant that
 intimated his Lord "was a hard and austere man, reaping where he had 
not sown, and gathering where he had not strewed?" Must Mr. Wesley 
increase the number? Or would you have him insinuate that God is more 
cruel than Pharaoh, who granted the poor Israelites <i>daylight, </i>if he allowed them <i>no straw </i>to make bricks; that he requires a heathen to work without any degree of <i>light, </i>without a <i>day </i>of
 visitation, in the Egyptian darkness of a merely natural state. And 
that he will then damn and torment him everlastingly, either for not 
doing, or for marring his work? O sir, like yourself; Mr. Wesley is too 
evangelical to entertain such notions of the God of love.  
</p><p>"At this rate," say some, "a heathen may be saved without a Savior. His <i>fearing God and working righteousness </i>will
 not go for the blood and righteousness of Christ." Mr. Wesley has no 
such thought. Whenever a heathen is accepted, it is merely through the 
merits of Christ; although it is in consequence of his <i>fearing God and working righteousness. </i>"But
 how comes he to see that God is to be feared, and that righteousness is
 his delight?" Because a beam of our Sun of righteousness shines in his 
darkness. All is therefore of grace; the light, the works of 
righteousness done by that light, and acceptance in consequence of them.
 how much more evangelical is this doctrine of St. Peter than that of 
some divines, who consign all the heathens by millions to hell torments 
because they cannot explicitly believe in a Savior whose name they never
 heard? Nay, and in whom it would be the greatest arrogancy to believe, 
if he never died for them? Is it not possible that heathens should, by 
grace, reap some blessings through the second Adam, though they know 
nothing of his name and obedience unto death; when they, by nature, reap
 so many curses through Adam the first; to whose name and disobedience 
they are equally strangers? If this is a heresy it is such a one as does
 honor to Jesus and humanity.  
</p><p>SECOND OBJECTION. "Mr. Wesley, by allowing the 
possibility of a righteous heathen's salvation, goes point blank against
 the eighteenth article of our Church, which he has solemnly 
subscribed."  
</p><p>ANSWER. This assertion is groundless. Mr. Wesley, 
far from presuming to say that a heathen "can he saved by the law or 
sect that he professes, if he frames his life according to the light of 
nature," cordially believes that all the heathens who are saved, attain 
salvation through the name, that is, through the merits and Spirit of 
Christ; by framing their life, not according to I know not what light 
naturally received from fallen Adam, but according to the supernatural 
light which Christ graciously affords them in the dispensations they are
 under.  
</p><p>THIRD OBJECTION. "however, if he does not impugn 
the eighteenth article, he does the thirteenth, which says, that 'works 
done before justification, or before the grace of Christ and the 
inspiration of his Spirit, forasmuch as they proceed not from faith in 
Christ, are not pleasant to God, yea, have the nature of sin.'"  
</p><p>Nay, this article does not affect Mr. Wesley's 
doctrine; for he constantly maintains that if the works of a 
Melchisedec, a Job, a Plato, a Cornelius, are accepted, it is only 
because they follow the general justification above mentioned, (which is
 possibly what St. Paul calls the "free gift that comes upon all men to 
justification of life," Rom. v, 18,) and because they proceed FROM "the 
grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his Spirit," they are not 
therefore done BEFORE that grace and inspirations as are the works which
 the article condemns.  
</p><p>FOURTH OBJECTION. "But 'all that is not of faith is sin, and without faith it is impossible to please God.'"  
</p><p>ANSWER. True: Therefore, "he that cometh to God 
must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that 
diligently seek him." Cornelius had undoubtedly this faith, and a degree
 of it is found in all sincere heathens. For Christ, the Light of men, 
visits all, though in a variety of degrees and dispensations. He said to
 the carnal Jews that believed not on him, "Yet a little while the light
 is with you; walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.
 While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the 
children of the light." All the heathens that are saved are then saved 
by a lively faith in Jesus, "the Light of the world;" or to use our 
Lord's own words, by "believing in the light" of their dispensation, 
before the day of their visitation is past, before total "darkness comes
 upon them," even the night when "no man can work."  
</p><p>FIFTH OBJECTION. "But if heathens can be saved without the Gospel, what need is there of the Christian dispensation?"  
</p><p>ANSWER, (1.) None of them were ever saved without a
 beam of the internal light of the Gospel, which is preached "in every 
creature under heaven," Col. i, 23. (2.) The argument may be retorted. 
If sinners could be saved under the patriarchal dispensation, what need 
was there of the Mosaic? If under the Mosaic, what need of John's 
baptism? If under the baptism of John, what need of Christianity? Or to 
answer by a comparison: If we see our way by starlight, what need is 
there of moonshine? If by moonshine, what need of the dawn of day? If by
 the dawn of day, what need of the rising sun?  
</p><p>The brightness of Divine dispensations, like the 
light of the righteous, "shines more and more unto the perfect day." And
 though a heathen may be saved in his low dispensation, and attain unto a
 low degree of glory, which the apostle compares to the shining of a 
star, ("for in my Father's house," says Christ, "there are <i>many mansions,") </i>yet
 it is an unspeakable advantage to be saved from the darkness attending 
his uncomfortable dispensation, into the full enjoyment of the "life and
 immortality brought to light by the <i>explicit </i>Gospel." Well might
 then the angel say to Cornelius, who was already accepted according to 
his dispensation, that Peter should "tell him words whereby he should he
 saved;" saved from the weakness, darkness, bondage, and tormenting 
fears attending his present state, into that blessed state of light, 
comfort, liberty, power, and glorious joy, where "he that is feeble is 
as David, and the house of David as God, or as the angel of the Lord."  
</p><p>Having thus briefly answered the objections that 
are advanced against St. Peter's and Mr. Wesley's doctrine, proceed we 
to the third query, In the review of the whole affair.  
</p><p>"III. Is this the same with, <i>he that is sincere? </i>Nearly, if not quite."  
</p><p>In the name of charity where is the error of this answer? Where the shadow of heresy? Do you suppose by<i> -- he that is sincere, </i>Mr.
 Wesley means "a carnal, unawakened wretch who boasts of his imaginary 
sincerity?" No, sir, he means "one who, in God's account, and not barely
 in his own, sincerely and uprightly follows the light of his 
dispensation." Now, if you expose Mr. Wesley as guilty of heresy, for 
using this word once, what protests will you enter against St. Paul for 
using it over and over? how will you blame him for desiring the 
Ephesians, (according to the beautiful reading of our margin,) to "be 
sincere in love!" [aXeuovs Ev agape]? Or, for wishing nothing greater to
 his dear Philippians, than that they might be "sincere in the day of 
Christ ?" O, sir, to fear, and much more, to love the Lord "in 
Sincerity," is a great and rare thing! Eph. vi, 24. We find every where 
too much of the "old leaven of malice," and too little of "the 
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth," 1 Cor. v, 8. Think not 
therefore that Mr. Wesley betrays the cause of God, because he thinks 
that "to be sincere," and to "fear God and work righteousness," are 
expressions nearly, if not quite synonymous.  
</p><p>But you do not perhaps find fault with Mr. Wesley 
for setting accepted heathens too low, but too high, by giving them the 
character of being sincere. For you know that our translators render the
 Hebrew word -- sometimes "sincere," at other times "upright, 
undefiled," and most commonly "perfect." As in these sentences, "Noah 
was a <i>perfect </i>man, Job was a <i>perfect </i>man," &amp;c. May not
 then Mr. Wesley secretly bring in his abominable doctrine of 
PERFECTION, under the less frightful expression of <i>sincerity? </i>Of this more by and by.  
</p><p>In the meantime, I shall close my vindication of 
the second and third query by the sentiments of two unquestionable 
Protestants on the present subject. The one is Mr. Henry, in his comment
 on St. Peter's words: "God," says he, "never did, nor ever will reject 
an honest Gentile who fears God, and worships him, and works 
righteousness; that is, is just and charitable toward all men, who lives
 up to the light he has, in a sincere devotion and regular conversation.
 Wherever God finds an <i>upright </i>man, he will be found an <i>upright </i>God, Psalm xviii, <i>25. </i>And
 those that have not the knowledge of Christ, and therefore cannot have 
an explicit regard to him, may yet receive grace for his sake, 'to fear 
God and work righteousness;' and wherever God gives grace to do so, as 
he did to Cornelius, he will, through Christ, accept the work of his own
 hands." here, sir, you have the very doctrine of Mr. Wesley quite down 
to the heretical word <i>sincere.</i>  
</p><p>The other divine, sir, is yourself. You tell us in
 your sermon on the same text, that "we cannot but admire and adore 
God's universal tenderness and pity for every people and nation under 
heaven, in that 'he willed not the death of any single sinner,' but 
accepteth every one into Gospel covenant with him, 'who feareth him and 
worketh righteousness,' according to the light imparted to him."  
</p><p>Now, sir, where is the difference between your <i>orthodoxy </i>and Mr. Wesley's <i>heresy</i>? He asserts, God accepts "him that <i>fears God and works righteousness </i>according to the light he has." Mr. Henry says, "him that lives up to the light he has:" and you, sir, "him <i>who feareth his God and worketh righteousness </i>according to the light imparted to him."  
</p><p>If Mr. Wesley must share the fate of Shadrach for 
his heresy, I doubt Mr. Henry will have that of Meshech, and you, of 
Abednego; for you are all three in the same honorable condemnation.  
</p><p>But Mr. Wesley, foreseeing that some will be 
offended at St. Peter's evangelical declaration concerning the 
acceptance of sincere heathens who work righteousness, proposes and 
answers the following objection: --  
</p><p>"IV. Is not this <i>salvation by works? </i>Not by the <i>merit </i>of works, but by works as a <i>condition."</i>  
</p><p>In the former part of this answer Mr. Wesley 
freely grants all you can require to guard the Gospel against the Popish
 doctrine of making satisfaction for sin, and meriting salvation by 
works: for he maintains, that, though God accepts the heathen who work 
righteousness, yet it is not through the merit of his works, but solely 
through that of Christ. Is not this the very doctrine of our Church, in 
her eleventh article, which treats of justification? "We are accounted 
righteous before God only for [thee <i>Marci] of our Lord Jesus Christ </i>by faith, and not for our own works, or <i>deserving." </i>Does not the opposition of the two sentences, and the explanatory word <i>deserving, </i>evidently
 show that "works meet for repentance" are not excluded from being in 
the sinner that comes to be justified, but from having any <i>merit </i>or worth to <i>purchase </i>his justification?  
</p><p>Our Church expresses herself more fully on this 
head in the homily on salvation, to which the article refers. "St. 
Paul," says she, "declares nothing [necessary] on the behalf of man 
concerning his justification, but only a true and lively faith; and yet <i>[observe] </i>that faith does not shut out repentance, hope, love, [of <i>desire </i>when we are coming, love of <i>delight </i>when
 we are come,] dread, and the fear of God to be joined with it in every 
man that is justified; but it shutteth them out from the office of 
justifying: so that though they be all present together in him that is 
justified, yet they justify not altogether." This is agreeable to St. 
Peter's doctrine, maintained by Mr. Wesley. Only <i>"faith in Christ" </i>for Christians, and <i>"faith in the light </i>of
 their dispensation" for HEATHENS, is necessary in order to acceptance. 
But though FAITH ONLY justifies, yet it is never alone; for "repentance,
 <i>hope, </i>love of desire, and the fear of God," necessarily 
accompany this faith if it is true and living. Our Church, therefore, is
 not at all against works proceeding from in, or accompanying faith in 
all its stages. She grants, that whether FAITH <i>seeks </i>or <i>finds </i>its object, whether it <i>longs for, </i>or <i>embraces </i>it, it is still a lively, active, and working grace. She is only against the vain conceit that WORKS have any hand in <i>meriting </i>justification or <i>purchasing </i>salvation, which is what Mr. Wesley likewise opposes.  
</p><p>If you say, that "his heresy does not consist in 
exploding the merit of works in point of salvation, but in using that 
legal expression, <i>salvation by works as a condition;</i>" I answer, that as I would not contend for the word <i>trinity, </i>because it is not in the Bible no, nor yet the word [<i>perfection</i>],<i> </i>though it is there; neither would I contend for the expression, <i>salvation by works, as a condition: </i>but the <i>thing</i>
 Mr. Wesley means by it is there in a hundred different turns and modes 
of expression. therefore, it is highly worth contending for: and so much
 the more, as it is, next to the doctrine of the atonement, the most 
important part of "the faith once delivered unto the saints."  
</p><p>Any candid person acquainted with Mr. Wesley's 
principles, (and for such only the Minutes were written,) cannot but see
 that he meant absolutely nothing but what our Savior means in these and
 like scriptures; namely, that salvation is suspended on a variety of 
things which divines call <i>by </i>various names, and which Mr. Wesley, with a majority of them, chooses to call <i>conditions. </i>"Except ye repent, ye shall all perish. Except ye be converted, and become as little children, <i>ye </i>shalt not enter into the kingdom of heaven." Here <i>repentance </i>and <i>conversion </i>are
 conditions of eternal salvation. "If ye believe not, ye shall die in 
your sins; for this is the work of God, [the work that God requires and 
approves,] that ye believe on him whom he hath sent." Here the <i>work of faith </i>is
 the condition. "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. Blessed 
are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree 
of life," and "may enter in through the gates of the city." And here it 
is <i>doing God's commandments.</i>  
</p><p>St. Paul, the evangelical Paul, says the same 
thing in a variety of expressions: "If any man love not the Lord Jesus, 
let him be anathema." If <i>love, </i>the noblest work of the heart, 
does not take place, the fearful curse will: -- "If ye live after the 
flesh, ye shall die;" but "if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds
 of the body, ye shall live." <i>Spiritual mortification </i>is here the condition. "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." There <i>holiness </i>is
 the condition. "Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor covetous, nor
 drunkards, nor thieves, nor revilers, shall inherit the kingdom of 
God." Here ceasing from <i>fornication, drunkenness, &amp;c, </i>is the same condition.  
</p><p>St. John is in the same condemnation as Mr. 
Wesley, for he declares, "There shall in no wise enter into the New 
Jerusalem any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh 
abomination, or maketh a lie." Here the condition is, <i>not working abomination, &amp;c. </i>"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer," and "ye know that no murderer hath eternal life." Here the condition is, <i>ceasing from hatred, </i>the murder of the heart.  
</p><p>St. Peter is equally deep in the heresy. In a 
variety of expressions he describes the misery and fatal latter end of 
those "who escape the pollution of the world, through the knowledge of 
the Lord Jesus, and are again entangled therein," through the 
non-performance of this condition, <i>"If ye do these things, ye shall never fall."</i>  
</p><p>As for St. James, I need not quote him. You know 
that, when Luther was in his heat, he could have found it in his heart 
to tear this precious epistle from among the sacred books, and burn it 
as <i>an epistle of straw. </i>He thought the author of it was an enemy to <i>free grace, </i>an
 abettor of Popish tenets, an antichrist. It is true, the scales of 
prejudice fell at last from his eyes; but, alas! it was not till he had 
seen the Antinomian boar lay waste the Lord's flourishing vineyard all 
over Protestant Germany. Then was he glad to draw against him St. James'
 despised sword; and I shall be happily mistaken, sir, if you are not 
obliged one day to make use of the <i>heretical Minutes, </i>as he did of the epistle of straw.  
</p><p>If any still urge, "I do not love the word <i>condition</i>;"
 I reply, it is no wonder; since thousands so hate the thing that they 
even choose to go to hell rather than perform it. But let an old worthy 
divine, approved by all but Dr. Crisp's disciples, tell you what we mean
 by <i>condition. </i>"An antecedent condition," says Mr. Flavel, in his <i>Discourse of Errors, "</i>signifies
 no more than an act of ours; which, though it be neither perfect in any
 degree, nor in the least meritorious of the benefit conferred, nor 
performed in our own natural strength; is yet, according to the 
constitution of the covenant required of us, in order to the blessings 
consequent thereupon, by virtue of the promise: and consequently, 
benefits and mercies granted in this order are, and must be, suspended 
by the donor, till it be performed." <i>Such a condition </i>we affirm <i>faith </i>to be, with all that faith necessarily implies.  
</p><p>When Dr. Crisp, in the last century, represented all the sober Puritan divines as <i>legal, </i>they answered, "The covenant, though <i>conditional, </i>is
 a dispensation of grace. There is grace in giving ability to perform 
the condition, as well as in bestowing the benefits. God's enjoining the
 one in order to the other makes not the benefit to be less of grace; 
but it is a display of God's wisdom, in conferring the benefit suitable 
to the nature and condition of men in this life, who are here in a state
 of trial; yea, the <i>conditions </i>are but a meetness to receive the blessings."  
</p><p>"The reason," added they, "why we use the word <i>condition, </i>is,
 because it best suits with man's relation to God, in his present 
dealings with us as his subjects on trial for eternity. Christ, as a 
priest, has merited all: but, as a priestly king, he dispenseth all; he 
enjoins the conditions in order to the benefits, and makes the benefits 
motives to our compliance with the conditions. He treats with men as his
 subjects, whom he will now <i>rule, </i>and hereafter <i>judge. </i>Now, what word is so proper to express the duties as <i>enjoined means </i>of benefit, as the word <i>conditions? </i>The word <i>conditions </i>is of the same nature as <i>terms </i>of
 the Gospel. There are few authors of note, even of any persuasion, that
 scruple using this word in our sense; as Ames, Twisse, Rutherford, 
Hooker, Norton, Preston, Owen, synod of New-England, the assembly of 
divines, &amp;c. And none have reason to scruple it, except such as 
think <i>we are justified before we are born." -- </i>See <i>"Gospel Truth Vindicated," </i>by Williams, against Dr. Crisp.  
</p><p>If all the Protestant divines who have directly or indirectly represented REPENTANCE and FAITH as <i>conditions of present salvation; </i>and HOLINESS OF HEART AND LIFE as <i>conditions of eternal glory, </i>as things <i>sine qui bus non, </i>without
 which salvation and glory neither can nor will follow. If all those 
divines, I say, are guilty of heresy, ninety-nine out of a hundred are 
heretics, and none of them deeper in the heresy than yourself.  
</p><p>In your Sermons, page 39, clearing yourself of the slander that "you do not preach up, recommend, and insist on <i>the necessity of good works;</i>"
 you add, "I not only preach this or that part of the moral law, but I 
preach the whole moral law; and I tell you plainly, that <i>if you do not perform the whole will of God, </i>you <i>cannot be finally saved."</i>  
</p><p>Then you add, "Surely, they who contend for the doctrine of <i>good works </i>will
 be satisfied with this, or they are very unreasonable." Indeed, sir, 
Mr. Wesley is quite satisfied with it; I only wonder what in the world 
can make you so dissatisfied with his Minutes; for he never gave 
Antinomianism a more legal thrust.  
</p><p>And as you make <i>works </i>so absolutely necessary to eternal salvation, so do you make a <i>law work </i>a
 universal prerequisite of the present salvation. Speaking of the fear 
and dread that seize a sinner under convictions of sin, you say, page 
111, "This inward shock of perturbation must pass upon the soul of every
 <i>returning </i>sinner more or less, before he can possibly be 
rendered a proper object of Divine grace and mercy." Hold, sir, you go 
one step beyond Mr. Wesley; for he steadily maintains, that if the 
sinner was not <i>a proper object of Divine grace </i>BEFORE he feels the inward shock you speak of, he would never <i>be shocked and return.</i>  
</p><p>Do not all unprejudiced persons see, that what Mr. Wesley calls <i>condition, </i>others call <i>way, means, </i>or <i>terms, </i>&amp;c. And that you have as little reason to pick a quarrel with him as to raise a <i>body </i>of men against a quiet traveler for calling a certain sum <i>a guinea, </i>whereas you think it more proper to call it <i>one pound one, -- twenty-one shillings,</i> <i>-- forty-two sixpencees, -- or sixty-three groats. </i>O,
 sir, what reason have we to be ashamed of our chicaneries; and to 
beseech the Lord that they may not stumble the weak, and harden 
infidels!  
</p><p>How justly does Mr. Wesley ask next  
</p><p>"V. What have we then been disputing about for these thirty years? I am afraid, about words."  
</p><p>Pardon me, sir, if here also I cannot, with you, cry <i>heresy! </i>Far
 from doing it, I admire the candor of an aged servant of God, who, 
instead of stiffly holding, and obstinately maintaining an old mistake, 
comes down as a little child, and freely acknowledges it before a 
respectable body of preachers, whose esteem it is his interest to 
secure.  
</p><p>How many are there that look upon Mr. Wesley as a 
rotten threshold, and themselves as pillars in the temple of God, who 
would not own themselves mistaken for the world!  
</p><p>He says, "I am afraid we have disputed about 
words:" perhaps he might have said, "I am very sure of it." How many 
disputes have been raised these thirty years among religious people, 
about those works of the heart which St. Paul calls "repentance toward 
God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ!" Some have called them <i>the only way </i>or <i>method </i>of receiving salvation, others <i>the means </i>of salvation, others <i>the terms </i>of it. Some have named them <i>duties </i>or <i>graces </i>necessary to salvation, others <i>conditions </i>of salvation, others <i>parts </i>of salvation, or <i>privileges </i>annexed
 to it; while others have gone the round about, and used I know not what
 far-fetched expressions and ambiguous phrases to convey the same idea. I
 say <i>the same idea; </i>for if all maintain that although <i>repentance </i>and <i>works meet for it, </i>and <i>faith working by love, </i>are not meritorious, they are nevertheless absolutely necessary; that they are a thing <i>sine qua non, </i>all are agreed; and that if they <i>dispute, </i>it must be, as Mr. Wesley justly intimates, <i>about words.</i>  
</p><p>A comparison will at once make you sensible of it. A physician tells me that the <i>way, </i>the <i>only way </i>or <i>method </i>in which we live, is by abstaining from poison, and taking proper food. "No," says another, "you should say, that <i>abstaining from poison </i>and <i>taking proper food </i>are the MEANS by which our life is preserved." "You are quite mistaken," says a third, <i>"rejecting poison </i>and <i>eating </i>are the TERMS God hath fixed upon for our preservation." "No," says a fourth, "they are <i>duties </i>without the performance, or <i>blessings, </i>without <i>the receiving </i>of which we must absolutely die." "I believe, for my part," says another, "that Providence hath engaged to preserve our life, <i>on condition </i>that
 we should forbear taking poison, and eat proper food." "You are all in 
the wrong, you know nothing at all of the matter," says another, who 
applauds himself much for his wonderful discovery, "turning from poison 
and receiving nourishment are the <i>exercises </i>of a living man; therefore they must absolutely be called <i>parts </i>of his life, or <i>privileges </i>annexed to it. You quite take away people's appetite, and clog their stomach, by calling them <i>duties, terms, conditions. </i>Only
 call them PRIVILEGES, and you will see nobody will touch poison, and 
all will eat most heartily." While they're all neglecting their food, 
and taking the poison of this contention, he that hath mentioned the 
word <i>condition, </i>starts up and says, "Review the whole affair; 
take heed of your assertions; I am afraid we dispute about words." Upon 
this all rise against him, all accuse him of robbing the Preserver of 
men of his glory, or holding a tenet injurious to the very fundamental 
principles of our constitution.  
</p><p>Let us leave them to the uneasy workings of their unaccountable panic, to consider the next article of the Minutes.  
</p><p>"VI. As to <i>merit itself, </i>of which we have been so dreadfully afraid: We are rewarded <i>according to our works, </i>yea, <i>because of our works. </i>how does this differ from, for <i>the sake of our works? </i>And how differs this from <i>secundum merita operum? </i>'as our works <i>deserve?</i>'<i> </i>Can you split this hair? I doubt, I cannot."  
</p><p>If Mr. Wesley meant that we are saved by the <i>merit of works, </i>and
 not by the alone merits of Christ, you might exclaim against his 
proposition as erroneous; and I would echo back your exclamation. But as
 he flatly denies it, No. 4, in those words, "not by the merit of 
works," and has constantly asserted the contrary for above thirty years,
 we cannot, without monstrous injustice, fix that sense upon the word <i>merit </i>in this paragraph.  
</p><p>Divesting himself of bigotry and party spirit, he 
generously acknowledges truth, even when it is held forth by his 
adversaries: an instance of candor worthy of our imitation! He sees that
 God offers and gives his children, here on earth, particular rewards 
for particular instances of obedience. He knows that when a man is saved
 meritoriously by Christ, and <i>conditionally by </i>(or if you please, <i>upon the terms of) the work of faith, the patience of hope, </i>and <i>the labor of love, </i>he shall particularly be rewarded in heaven <i>for this work. </i>And he observes, that the Scriptures steadily maintain, "we are recompensed <i>according to </i>our works, yea, <i>because of </i>our works."  
</p><p>The former of these assertions is plain from the 
parable of the talents, and from these words of our Lord, Matt. xvi, 27,
 "The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, and reward every
 man <i>according to his work:</i>" UNBELIEVERS according to the various
 degrees of demerit belonging to their vile works, (for some of them 
shall comparatively be "beaten with few stripes;") and BELIEVERS 
according to the various degrees of excellence found in their good 
works; for as "one star differeth from another star in glory, so also is
 the resurrection of the righteous dead."  
</p><p>The latter assertion is not less evident from the 
repeated declarations of God: "BECAUSE thou hast kept the word of my 
patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall
 come upon all the world," Rev. iii, 10. "BECAUSE Phinehas was zealous 
for his God," in killing Zimri <i>and </i>Corbi, "behold I give unto him
 my covenant of peace, and he shall have it, and his seed after him, 
even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood." And again: "BECAUSE 
thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, by myself have I 
sworn that in blessing I will bless thee, <i>because </i>thou hast 
obeyed my voice." Now, says Mr. Wesley, "How differs this from, 'I will 
bless thee, for the sake of thy obedience to my voice?' And how differs 
this from <i>secundum merita obedientiz? </i>'as thy obedience deserves?'" And by comparing the difference of these expressions to <i>the splitting of a hair, </i>or to a metaphysical subtlety, he very justly insinuates that we have been too dreadfully afraid of the word <i>merit. </i>Surely,
 sir, you will not divest yourself of the candor that belongs to a 
Christian, to put on the bitter zeal of a bigot. You will not run, for 
fear of Popery, into the very spirit of it, by crying, <i>Heresy! heresy! </i>before
 you have maturely considered the question: or, if you have done so 
once, you will do it no more. And if Mr. Wesley should ever propose 
again "the splitting of a hair," I hope you will remember that equity 
(to say nothing of brotherly love) requires you to split the hair <i>first </i>yourself, before you can with decency stir up people far and near against him, for modestly doubting whether he can do it or no.  
</p><p>But suppose some are determined to cry <i>heresy! </i>whenever they see the word <i>merit; </i>I hope others will candidly weigh what follows in the balance of unprejudiced reason.  
</p><p>If we detach from the word <i>merit </i>the idea 
of "obligation on God's part to bestow any thing upon creatures who have
 a thousand times forfeited their comforts and existence;" if we take it
 in the sense we fix to it in a hundred cases: for instance, this, "A 
master may reward his scholars according to the <i>merit </i>of their exercises, or he may not; for the <i>merit </i>of
 the best exercise can never bind him to bestow a premium for it, unless
 he has promised it of his own accord." If we take, I say, the word <i>merit </i>in this simple sense, it may be joined to the word <i>good works, </i>and bear an evangelical meaning.  
</p><p>To be convinced of it, candid reader, consider, 
with Mr. Wesley, that "God accepts and rewards no work but so far as it 
proceeds from his own grace through the Beloved." Forget not that 
Christ's Spirit is the savor of each believer's salt, and that he puts 
excellence into the good works of his people, or else they could not be <i>good. </i>Remember,
 he is as much concerned with the good tempers, words, and actions of 
his living members, as a tree is concerned in the sap, leaves, and fruit
 of the branches it bears, John xv, 5. Consider, I say, all this; and 
tell us whether it can reflect dishonor upon Christ and his grace, to 
affirm that "as his personal merit, -- the merit of his holy life and 
painful death, -- ' opens the kingdom of heaven to all believers,' so 
the merit of those works which he enables his members to do, will 
determine the peculiar degrees of glory graciously allotted to each of 
them."  
</p><p>I own, I believe there is such a dignity in every 
thing in which the Son of God has a hand, that the Father, who is always
 well pleased with him and his works, cannot but look upon it with 
peculiar complacency. Even a "cup of water given in his <i>dear </i>name,"
 that is, by the efficacy of his loving Spirit, hath that in it which 
"shall in no wise lose its reward;" for it has something of the love of 
the God-man, Jesus Christ, which merits all the approbation and smiles 
of the Father.  
</p><p>In our well-meant zeal against Popery we have been driven to an extreme, and have not done <i>good works </i>justice.
 "I am the Vine," says Jesus, "and ye are the branches: he that abideth 
in me bringeth forth much fruit. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye 
bear much fruit." What! is the Father glorified in the fruit of 
believers? And shall this fruit be represented to us always grub-eaten, 
and rotten at the core. Do we honor either the Vine or the husbandman, 
while one hour we speak wonders of the Vine and its fruit, and the next 
represent the branches and their fruit as full of deadly poison?  
</p><p>O God of mercy and patience, forgive us, for we know not what we do! We even think we do thee service. O give us <i>genuine, </i>and save us from <i>voluntary </i>humility!  
</p><p>Believer, let not the virtue of thy Savior's 
righteousness, the only good thing that is in thee, be evil spoken of. 
"Thou art grafted upon the good olive tree; be not high minded, but 
fear;" fear to be <i>cut off </i>like the branch that "beareth not 
fruit." But be not afraid to suck the balmy sap, till the peaceful olive
 ripens in thy soul, and drops the oil of joy that makes a cheerful 
countenance. Thou art "married to Christ, that henceforth thou shouldest
 bring forth fruit unto God." O let not thy mistaken brethren discourage
 thee from doing all the good that thy heart and hand find to do, and 
that "with all thy might!"  
</p><p>I write these allusions as they occur to my mind, 
to raise thy thoughts above spiritual sloth and barrenness of heart, by 
showing thee, through a Scriptural glass, something of thy Husband's 
glory, and of the excellence of the "labor of love," wherein thou hast 
the honor of being "a worker together with him." Let not what I say puff
 thee up, but encourage thee to "be steadfast, unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as thou knowest thy labor 
shall not be in vain in the Lord." Remember thou hast nothing to boast 
of, but much reason to be humbled. If thy works are compared to a rose, 
the color, odor, and sweetness are Christ's; the aptness to fade, and 
the thorns, are thine. If the burning taper, the snuff and smoke come 
from thee; the bright and cheering light from thy Bridegroom. The 
excellence and merit of the performance flow from him; the flaws and 
imperfections from thee. Nevertheless, the whole work is as truly thine,
 as grapes are truly the fruit of the branch that bore them. And yet, 
"as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine,
 no more canst thou, except thou abide in Christ; for without him thou 
canst do nothing."  
</p><p>Having thus cautioned thee against the Popish 
abuse of Mr. Wesley's doctrine of the excellence of works, and shown 
thee the evangelical use that a <i>real Protestant </i>should make of 
it; I return to the word "merit, of which we have been so dreadfully 
afraid." Let a comparison help thee to understand how a believer may use
 it in a very harmless sense.  
</p><p>The king promises rewards for good pictures, to 
miserable foundlings, whom he has charitably brought up, and graciously 
admitted into his royal academy of painting. Far from being masters of 
their art, they can of themselves do nothing but spoil canvass, and 
waste colors by making monstrous figures. But the king's son, a perfect 
painter, by his father's leave, guides their hands; and, by that means, 
good pictures are produced, though not so excellent as they would have 
been had not he made them by their stiff and clumsy hands. The king, 
however, approves of them, and fixes the reward of each picture 
according to its peculiar <i>merit. </i>If thou say, "that the poor foundlings, owing all to his majesty, and the prince having freely guided their hands, themselves <i>merit </i>nothing;
 because, after all they have done, they are miserable daubers still, 
and nothing is properly theirs but the imperfections of the pictures, 
and therefore the king's reward, though it may be of promise, can never 
be of debt;" I grant, I assert it. But if thou sayest, "The good 
pictures have no <i>merit," </i>I beg leave to dissent from thee, and 
tell thee thou speakest as unadvisedly for the king, as Job's friends 
did for God. For if the pictures have absolutely no <i>merit, </i>dost not thou greatly reflect upon the king's taste and wisdom in saying that he <i>reward </i>them? In the name of common sense, what is it he rewards? The <i>merit </i>or <i>(demerit </i>of the work ).  
</p><p>But this is not all: if the pictures have no <i>merit, </i>what
 hath the king's son been doing? Hath he lost all his trouble in helping
 the novices to sketch and finish them? Shall we deny the excellence of <i>his </i>performance because <i>they </i>were
 concerned in it? Shall we be guilty of this glaring partiality any 
longer? No: some Protestants will dare to judge righteous judgment, and 
acknowledging there is <i>merit </i>where Christ <i>puts </i>it, and where God <i>rewards </i>it, they will give "honor to whom honor is due," even to him "that worketh all the <i>good </i>in all" his creatures.  
</p><p>For my part, I entirely agree with the author of 
the Minutes, and thank him for daring to break the ice of prejudice and 
bigotry among us, by restoring <i>works of righteousness </i>to their 
deserved glory, without detracting from the glory of "the Lord our 
righteousness." I am as much persuaded that the grace of Christ <i>merits </i>in
 the works of his members, though they themselves merit nothing but 
hell, as I am persuaded that gold in the ore hath its intrinsic worth, 
though it is mixed with dust and dross, which are good for nothing. As 
there is but one Mediator, one prevailing Intercessor "between God and 
us," even "the man Christ Jesus;" and, nevertheless, his Spirit in us 
"maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered:" so
 there is but one man whose works are truly meritorious; but when he 
works in us by his Spirit, our works cannot, (so far as he is concerned 
in them,) but be in a sense meritorious; because <i>they </i>are his 
works. Real Protestant, if thou deniest this, thou maintainest an 
antichristian proposition, namely, that Christ has lost his power of <i>redeeming.</i>  
</p><p>Herein I must dissent from thee, nor will the 
cry," Heresy! Popery!" make me give up this fundamental truth of 
Christianity, that "Jesus is the same," the very same <i>deserving </i>Lord, "yesterday, to-day, and for ever."  
</p><p>In this evangelical view of things, the Redeemer 
is much exalted by the doctrine of the "merit" of good works; and 
believers are still left in their native dust to cry out, "Not unto us, 
not unto us, but to <i>thy </i>name give we the praise!" In the light of
 this precious truth we see and admire the endearing contest that is 
always carried on between God's loving kindness and the humble gratitude
 of believers. God says, "Well done, good and faithful servants! reap 
what ye have sown:" and they answer, "Lord, THY pound hath gained all; 
thou hast wrought all our works in us." God says, "They shall walk with 
me in white, for they are worthy:" and they reply, "Worthy, is the Lamb 
that was slain, and hath washed us from our sins in his own blood." 
Christ crowns faith by this gracious declaration, "Thy faith hath saved 
thee." And believers, in their turn, crown Christ by this true 
confession, "Not by works of righteousness that we have done, but 
according to thy mercy thou hast saved us; for thou hast quickened us by
 thy Spirit, when we were dead in sin; yea, thou didst redeem us unto 
God by thy blood," hundreds of years before we had done any good work. 
In a word, they justly give God all the glory of their salvation, 
agreeable to the first axiom in the Gospel plan; and God graciously 
gives them all the reward, according to the second.  
</p><p>And now, is it not a pity, that any good men 
should be so far biased by the prejudice of their education, or 
influenced by the spirit of their party, as to account this delightful, 
harmonizing view of evangelical truths, "a dreadful heresy?" Is it not 
pity, that, by so doing, they should expose their prepossession, 
strengthen the hands of Antinomians, harden the hearts of Papists, 
deprive their Savior of part of the honor due to him, leave <i>seeming </i>contradictions
 in the Scriptures unexplained, and trample under foot, as unworthy of 
their Protestant orthodoxy, a powerful motive to obedience, by which 
neither Moses nor Jesus was above being influenced? For the one "looked 
to the recompense of reward;" and the other, "for the joy that was set 
before him, both despised the shame, and endured the cross."  
</p><p>It may not be amiss to illustrate what has been 
advanced upon the merit or rewardableness of works, by Scriptural 
instances of old and modern saints who have pleaded it before Gad. David
 speaks thus in the eighteenth psalm: -- "The Lord rewarded me according
 to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands hath he 
recompensed me: I was upright before him, therefore hath he recompensed 
me according to my righteousness," &amp;c. And in the one hundred and 
nineteenth psalm, having mentioned his spiritual comforts, he says, 
"This I had, because I kept thy precepts." Another instance, no less 
remarkable, is that of Hezekiah, who prayed thus in his sickness, 
"Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in 
truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy
 sight!"  
</p><p>We see instances of this boldness in the New 
Testament also: 'We have left all to follow thee," said once the 
disciples of our Lord, and "what shall we have" for this sacrifice? 
Jesus, instead of blaming their question, simply told them they should 
have "a hundred fold" for all they had left, and made it a standing rule
 of distribution for all the Church. St. John, legal St. John, is not 
ashamed to say, that "if our heart condemn us not, then have we 
confidence toward God, and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because 
we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his 
sight." He even exhorts the elect lady to "look to herself that she 
might not lose the things that she had wrought, but receive a full 
reward." And the evangelical Apostle Paul desires the Hebrews "not to 
cast away their confidence, which," says he, "hath great recompense of 
reward;" and charges the Colossians to see "that none beguiled them of 
their reward, in a voluntary humility."  
</p><p>From these and the like scriptures, I conclude, 
that those who have a clear witness they have done what God commanded, 
may, without "heresy," humbly demand the promised reward; which they can
 never do without this idea, that, according to the tenor of the Gospel 
covenant, they are fit subjects for it.  
</p><p>I know some will take the alarm; and, to save the 
ark, which they think totters by this doctrine, will affirm, that "in 
the above mentioned passages, David personates Christ; and Hezekiah the 
Pharisee." But this is contradicting the whole context, to say nothing 
of all sober commentators. Mr. Henry tells us, that David, in these 
verses, "reflects with comfort upon his own integrity, and rejoiceth, 
like St. Paul, in the testimony of his own conscience, that he had had 
his conversation in godly sincerity." And he informs us, that the 
psalmist lays down in this psalm "the rules of God's government, that we
 may know, not only what God expects from us, but what we may expect 
from him." With regard to Hezekiah, it is plain his prayer was heard; a 
strong proof that it was inspired by the Spirit of Jesus, and not that 
of the Pharisee.  
</p><p>But if you reject, sir, the testimony of David and
 Hezekiah because they were Jews, receive, at least, that of "real 
Protestants;" for which we need only go as far as Bath or Talgarth 
parish; there we shall find chapels, where the Protestants have agreed 
together to ask <i>rewards </i>as solemnly as ever David and Hezekiah 
did. In the Hymns you have revised for another edition, and by that 
means made your own with respect to the doctrine, one is calculated to 
"welcome a messenger of Jesus' grace." and all the congregation sings,  

</p><ul><ul>Give <i>reward </i>of grace and glory  </ul></ul>


<ul><ul>To thy faithful laborer there.</ul></ul>

<p>What, sir, do you allow the labors of a minister to be
 of such dignity, and his faithfulness to have such uncommon merit, that
 a thousand people can boldly ask God a reward for him, and that not 
only of gifts and temporal blessings, but of grace; and not of grace 
only, but of glory tool You have in those two lines the very 
quintessence of the three grand heresies of the Minutes, "faithfulness, 
works, and merit." Permit me to add one passage more, from page 312, of <i>Baxter's Methodus Theologice Chrisliance.</i>  
</p><p>"The word <i>merit, </i>rightly explained, is not 
amiss. All the fathers of the primitive Church have made use of it 
without opposition, to the best of my remembrance. It may be used by 
believers who do not make it a cloak for error; by wise men who will not
 be offended at it, and by those who want to defend the truth, and 
convey clearer ideas in the explanation of things intricate. There is no
 word that fully conveys the same idea; that which comes nearest to it 
is <i>dignity, </i>and suspicious persons will not like it much better. We have three words <i>in </i>the
 New Testament that come very near it, [axios], [misthos], and 
[endikos], and they occur pretty frequently there. We render them <i>worthy, reward, </i>and <i>just; </i>and the abuse which Papists make of them ought not to make us reject their use. The English word <i>worthy </i>conveys no other idea than that of the Latin word <i>meritum, </i>taken actively; nor has the word <i>reward </i>any other signification than the word <i>meritum, </i>taken passively; therefore, they who can put a candid sense upon the words <i>worthy, </i>and <i>reward, </i>should do the same with regard to the word [ ]  
</p><p>Having explained and vindicated the sixth article of the Minutes, I proceed to the  
</p><p>"VII. The grand objection to one of the preceding 
propositions is drawn from matter of fact. God does, in fact, justify 
those who, by their own confession, neither 'feared God, nor wrought 
righteousness.' Is this an exception to the rule? It is a doubt, if God 
make any exception at all. But how are we sure that the person in 
question never did 'fear God and work righteousness?' His own saying so 
is not proof: for we know how all that are convinced of sin undervalue 
themselves in every respect."  
</p><p>Do you think, sir, the "heresy" of this 
proposition consists in intimating that God does, in fact, justify those
 who fear him, and not those who make absolutely no stop in the downward
 road of open sin and flagrant iniquity? If it does, I am sure the 
sacred writers are heretics to a man. See the account we have of 
conversions in the Scripture; please to remember what Mr. Wesley means 
by justification, and then answer the following questions: -- Did not 
the prodigal son "come to himself," repent, and return to his father, 
before he received the kiss of peace? Did not the woman that was a 
sinner forsake her wicked course of life before our Lord said to her, 
"Go in peace, thy sins are forgiven thee?"  
</p><p>Again: was not the woman of Samaria convinced of 
sin, yea, of "all that ever she did," before our Lord revealed himself 
to her, to enable her to believe unto justification? Did not Zaccheus 
evidence his <i>fear of God, </i>yea, and "work righteousness," by 
hearty offers of restitution, before Christ testified that he was "a son
 of Abraham?" Did not St. Paul express his fear of God, and readiness to
 work righteousness, when he cried out, "Lord, what wouldst thou have me
 to do?" Yea, did he not produce "fruit meet for repentance," by praying
 three days and three nights, before Ananias was sent to direct him "how
 to wash <i>away </i>his sins?" Did not the eunuch and Cornelius fear 
God? Did not David himself, whom the apostle mentions as a grand 
instance of justification without the merit of works, fear God from his 
youth? And when he had wrought folly in Israel, was be not humbled for 
his sin, before he was washed from it? Did he not confess his crime, and
 say, "I have sinned." before Nathan said by Divine commission, "The 
Lord hath put away thy sin?"  
</p><p>Does not St. Paul himself carry Mr. Wesley's 
"heresy" so far as to say, "Whosoever among you feareth God, to you is 
the word of this salvation sent?" Acts xiii, 26. Must we so understand 
Rom. iv, 5, as to make him contradict, point blank, his own 
declarations, his own experience, and the account of all the above 
mentioned conversions? Certainly not. Those words, "God justifies the 
ungodly, and him that worketh not, but believeth in Jesus," when 
candidly explained, agree perfectly with Mr. Wesley's doctrine. (1.) By 
"the ungodly," the apostle does not mean "the wicked that does not 
forsake his way;" but the man who, before he believed to justification, 
was ungodly, and still remains ungodly in the eye of the law of works, 
needing daily forgiveness by grace, even after he is made godly in a 
Gospel sense. (2.) By "him that worketh not" St. Paul does not mean a 
lazy, indolent wretch, who, without any reluctance, follows the stream 
of his corrupt nature; but "a penitent," who, whatever works he does, 
has no dependence upon them, esteems them as nothing, yea, "as dung and 
dross <i>in comparison of </i>the excellency of Christ;" and, in short, 
one who does not work to merit or purchase his justification, but comes 
to receive that invaluable blessing as a free gift. (3.)<i> </i>That 
this is the meaning of the apostle is evident from his adding, that he 
who "worketh not," yet "believeth." For if he took the word "worketh 
not," in an absolute sense, he could never make it agree with 
"believing," which is certainly a <i>work, </i>yea, a work of our 
noblest part; for "with the heart man believeth to righteousness." Add 
to this, sir, that justifying faith, as I observed before, never comes 
without her forerunner, conviction; nor conviction of sin without 
suitable tempers or inward works. "There is nothing," says Dr. Owen, 
"that I will more firmly adhere to in this whole doctrine, than the 
necessity of convictions previous to true believing; -- as also 
displacency, sorrow, fear, a desire of deliverance, with other necessary
 effects of true convictions." St. Paul, therefore, is consistent with 
himself, and Mr. Wesley with St. Paul.  
</p><p>Again: if God justify sinners merely as "ungodly," and people that "work not," why should he not justify <i>all </i>sinners;
 for they are all ungodly, and there is "none of them that does good, 
no, not one?" Why did not the Pharisee, for example, go to his house 
justified as well as the publican? You will probably answer, that "he 
was not convinced of sin." Why, sir, this is just what Mr. Wesley 
maintains. Express yourself in St. Peter's words, "He did <i>not fear God;</i>" or in those of John the Baptist, "He did not <i>bring forth fruits meet for repentance"?</i>  
</p><p>Should some ask, "What <i>works meet for repentance </i>did
 the woman caught in adultery do, before our Lord justified her?" I 
would ask, in my turn, how do they know that the Lord justified her? 
They conclude it from those words, "Neither do I condemn thee?" Does not
 the context show, that as the Pharisees had not condemned her to be 
stoned, according to the Mosaic law, neither would our Lord take upon 
himself to pass sentence upon her, according to his declaration on 
another occasion, "I am not sent to condemn the world, but that the 
world through me might be saved?" This by no means implies, that the 
world is justified in St. Paul's sense, Rom. v, 1. But supposing she was
 justified, how do you know that our Lord's words, writing, looks, and 
grace, had not brought her to godly shame and sorrow, that is, to "the 
fear of God," and "the working of <i>internal </i>righteousness," before he gave her the peace that passes all understanding?  
</p><p>After all, Mr. Wesley says, with modesty and 
wisdom, "It is a doubt whether God makes any exception at all:" and it 
lies upon you to show there is in these words any thing contrary to the 
humility of the true Christian, and orthodoxy of the sound divine. But 
please to remember, that if you judge of orthodoxy according to the 
works of Dr. Crisp, we will take the liberty to appeal to the word of 
God.  
</p><p>But you make, perhaps, Mr. Wesley's heresy in this
 proposition consist in his refusing to take the word of persons 
convinced of sin, when they say they never "feared God nor wrought 
righteousness." "For we know," says he, "how all that are convinced of 
sin, undervalue themselves in every respect."  
</p><p>Had Mr. Wesley imagined that some Christian 
friends (O my God, deliver me from such friendship!) would leave no 
stone unturned to procure a copy of his Minutes, in order to find some 
occasion against him, he would probably have worded this with more 
circumspection. But he wrote for real friends; and he knew such would at
 once enter into his meaning, which is, that "persons deeply convinced 
of sin are apt, very apt, to form a wrong judgment both of their state 
and performances, and to think the worst of themselves in every respect,
 that is, both with regard to what Divine grace does in them, and by 
them."  
</p><p>And this is so obvious a truth, that he must be a 
novice indeed in Christian experience who doubts of it for a moment; and
 a great lover of disputing, who will make a man an offender for so true
 an assertion. Do not we daily see some, in whom the arrows of 
conviction stick fast, who think they are as much past recovery as Satan
 himself? Do not we hear others complain, "they grow worse and worse," 
when they only discover more and more how bad they are by nature? And 
are there not some, who bind upon themselves heavy burdens of their own 
making, and when they cannot bear them, are tormented in their 
consciences with imaginary guilt; while others are ready to go 
distracted through groundless fears of having committed the sin against 
the holy Ghost? In a word, do we not see hundreds, who, when they have 
reason to hope well of their state, think there is no hope for them? In 
all these respects do <i>they </i>not act like Jonah in the whale's 
belly, and complain, "I am cast out of thy sight?" And have not they 
need to encourage themselves in their God, and say, "Why art thou cast 
down, O my soul?"  
</p><p>But let your conscience speak, sir, on this 
matter. When some deep mourners have complained to you of their misery, 
danger, and desperate state, did you never drop a word of comfort to 
this effect. "You undervalue yourselves; you write too bitter things 
against yourselves; your case is not so bad as your unbelieving fears 
represent it:  
</p><p>God's thoughts are not as your thoughts. Many, 
like the foolish virgins, think themselves sure of heaven, when they 
stand on the brink of hell; and many think they are just dropping into 
it, who are not far from the kingdom of God."  
</p><p>Yea, and as it is with real seekers, so it is with real believers. Did not they undervalue, yea, degrade themselves, <i>by </i>the
 remains of their unbelief; or, which is the same, did they live up to 
their dignity, and every where consider themselves as "members of 
Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven," "what
 manner of persons," yea, what angels "would they be in all holy 
conversation!"  
</p><p>Sometimes their light shines with peculiar luster,
 like Moses' face, and they "know it not." Thousands "see their good 
works, and glorify their Father who is in heaven;" but the matter is hid
 from them: they complain, perhaps, that they are the most unprofitable 
of all his children. Let me instance in one particular: St. Paul, Mr. 
White-field, and thousands of the brightest stars of the Church, have 
called themselves both "the chief of sinners," and "the least of all 
saints." Now, as in a chain there is but one link that can be called <i>the first, </i>or <i>the last; </i>so
 in the very nature of things, there can be but one man in the immense 
file of Christ's soldiers, that is actually "the chief of sinners," and 
"the least of all saints." If a thousand believers, therefore, say, 
those two appellations belong to themselves, it is evident that at least
 nine hundred and ninety-nine undervalue themselves. For my part, I 
cannot but think they [suit lime?] ten thousand times better than they 
did St. Paul. I must therefore insolently think myself a less sinner and
 a greater saint than him; or of necessity believe that he, and "all 
that are partakers of the same convincing grace," <i>undervalue themselves in every respect.</i>  
</p><p>One more article remains, and if it does not 
contain "the dreadful heresy," which hitherto we have looked for in 
vain, the Minutes are, from first to last, Scripturally orthodox, and 
you have given Churchmen and dissenters a false alarm.  
</p><p>"VIII. Does not talking of a justified and 
sanctified state tend to mislead men? Almost naturally leading them to 
trust in what was done in one moment; whereas we are every hour, and 
every moment, pleasing or displeasing to God, according to our works -- 
according to the whole of our inward tempers and outward behavior."  
</p><p>To do this proposition justice, and prevent misunderstandings, I must premise some observations.  
</p><p>1. Mr. Wesley is not against persons talking of 
justification and sanctification in a Scriptural sense: for when he 
"knows the tree by the fruits," he says himself to his flocks, as St. 
Paul did to the Corinthians, "Some of you are sanctified and justified."
 Nor does he deny that God justifies a penitent sinner in a moment, and 
that in a moment "he can manifest himself" unto his believing people "as
 he does not to the world, and give them an inheritance among them that 
are sanctified, through faith in Jesus." His objection respects only the
 idea entertained by some, and countenanced by others, that when God 
forgives us our sins, he introduces us into a state where we are 
unalterably fixed in his blessed favor, and for ever stamped with his 
holy image; so that it matters no longer whether the tree is barren or 
not, whether it produces good or bad fruit; it was set at such a time, 
and therefore it must be a "tree of righteousness" still. A conclusion 
directly contrary to the words of our Lord and his beloved disciple: "By
 their fruits ye shall know them. He that sinneth is of the devil. Every
 branch in me that beareth not fruit., [much more that beareth evil 
fruit,] my Father taketh away."  
</p><p>2. Permit me, sir, to observe also, that Mr. 
Wesley has many persons in his societies, (and would to God there were 
none in ours!) who profess they were justified or sanctified in a 
moment; but instead of trusting in the living God, so trust to what was 
done in that moment, as to give over "taking up their cross daily, and 
watching unto prayer with all perseverance." The consequences are 
deplorable; they slide back into the spirit of the world; and their 
tempers are no more regulated by the meek, gentle, humble love of Jesus.
 Some inquire with the heathens, "What shall we eat, and what shall we 
drink," to please ourselves? Others evidently "love the world, lay up 
treasures on earth," or ask, "wherewith shall we be <i>fashionably </i>clothed?"
 Therefore "the love of the Father is not in them." And not a few are 
"led captive by the devil at his will;" influenced by his unhappy 
suggestions, they harbor bitterness, malice, and revenge; none is in the
 right but themselves, and "wisdom shall die with them."  
</p><p>Now, sir, Mr. Wesley cannot but fear it is not 
well with persons who are in any of these cases. Though every body 
should join to extol them as "dear children of God," he is persuaded 
that "Satan has beguiled them as he did Eve;" and he addresses them as 
our Lord did the angel of the Church of Sardis, "I know thy works, that 
thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead, [or dying:] repent, 
therefore, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to 
die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God." Mr. Wesley hath
 the word of prophecy, which he thinks more sure than the opinion of a 
world of professors; and, according to that word, he sees that "they who
 are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God," and that God's 
Spirit does not lead into the vanities of the world, or indulgences of 
fleshly lusts, any more than into the pride or malice of Satan. Nor does
 he think that those are not "under the law" who can merrily laugh at 
the law, and pass jests upon Moses, the venerable servant of God. But 
with St. Paul he asserts, that when people are "under grace, and not 
under the law, sin hath not dominion over them." With our Lord he 
declares, "He who committeth sin, is the servant of sin;" and with his 
prophet, that "God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity" with the 
least degree of approbation. In short, he believes that God, being 
unchangeable in his holiness, cannot but always "love righteousness and 
hate iniquity;" and that, as the heart is continually working either 
iniquity or righteousness, and as God cannot but be pleased at the one, 
and displeased at the other, he is continually pleased or displeased 
with us, according to the workings of our hearts, and the fruits which 
they outwardly produce.  
</p><p>Perhaps you object to the word "every moment." But why should you, sir? If it be not <i>every moment, </i>it is <i>never. </i>If
 God do not approve holiness, and disapprove sin every moment, he never 
does it, for he changes not. If he do it only now and then, he is such a
 one as ourselves; for even wicked men will approve righteousness and 
condemn unrighteousness by fits and starts. I may every moment harbor 
malice in my heart, and so commit internal murder. If God winks at this 
one instant, why not two? And so on to days, months, and years? Does the
 <i>duration </i>of moral evil constitute sin? May not I be guilty of 
the greatest enormity in the twinkling of an eye? And is it not the 
ordinary property of the most horrid crimes, such as robbery and 
adultery, that they are soon finished?  
</p><p>Do not say, sir, that this doctrine sets aside 
"salvation by faith." It is highly consistent with it. He that, in God's
 account, does the best works, has the most faith, most of the sap of 
eternal life that flows<i> </i>from the heavenly Vine. And he that has 
most faith has most of Christ's likeness, and is of course most pleasing
 to God, who cannot be pleased but with Christ and his living image. On 
the other hand he that in God's account does the worst works, and has 
the worst tempers, has most unbelief. He that has most unbelief, is most
 "like his father, the Devil;" and must consequently be most displeasing
 to him that accepts us "in the Beloved," and not "in the wicked one."  
</p><p>Having premised these observations, I come closer 
to the point, and assert that if we are not every moment pleasing or 
displeasing to God, according to the works of our hearts and hands, you 
must set your seal to the following absurdities: -- (1.) "God is angry 
with the wicked all the day," and yet there are moments in which he is 
not angry at them. (2.) Lot <i>pleased </i>God as much in those moments 
in which he got drunk and committed incest with his daughters, as in the
 day he exercised hospitality toward the disguised angels. (3.) David 
did not <i>displease </i>God more when he committed adultery with 
Bathsheba, and [imbrued] his hands in her husband's blood, than when he 
danced before the ark, or composed the 103d Psalm. (4.) Solomon was as 
acceptable to God in the moment when "his wives turned away his heart 
after other gods," as when he chose wisdom, and his speech pleased the 
Lord, when he went after the goddess Ashtaroth, and built a high place 
to holy Moloch, as when he represented our Melchisedec, and dedicated 
the temple. (5.) Again: you must set your seal to these propositions of 
Dr. Crisp:  
</p><p>"From the time thy transgressions were laid upon 
Christ, thou ceasest to be a transgressor to the last hour of thy life 
so that now thou art not an idolater, thou art not a thief, &amp;c; thou
 art not a sinful person, whatsoever sin thou committest." Again: "God 
does no longer stand offended nor displeased, though a believer, after 
he is a believer, do sin often; except he will be offended where there 
is no cause to be offended, which is blasphemy to speak." Yet again: "It
 is thought that elect persons are in a damnable estate in the time they
 walk in excess of riot; let me speak freely to you that the Lord has no
 more to lay to the charge of an elect person, yet in the height of 
iniquity, and in the excess of riot, and committing all the abominations
 that can be committed." "There is no time but such a person is a child 
of God." (6.) In short, sir, you must be of the sentiment of the wildest
 Antinomian I ever knew, who, because he had once a bright manifestation
 of pardon, not only concludes that he is safe, though he lives in open 
sin, but asserts God would no more be <i>displeased </i>with him for whoring and stealing, than for praying and receiving the sacrament.  
</p><p>Again: It is an important truth, that we may 
please God for a time, and yet afterward displease him. St. Paul 
mentions those who, by putting away a good conscience, "concerning faith
 made shipwreck," and therefore pleased God no longer, "seeing that 
without faith it is impossible to please him."  
</p><p>Of this the Israelites are a remarkable instance. 
"They did all drink of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that 
rock was Christ. Yet with many of them God was not well pleased." Then 
comes the proof of the Divine displeasure; for "they were overthrown in 
the wilderness. Now," adds the apostle, "these things happened unto them
 for examples, and they are written for our admonition, that we should 
not lust after evil things, and tempt Christ as they did. Therefore, let
 him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest," after their example, 
"he fall" into willful sin, the Divine displeasure, and utter 
destruction.  
</p><p>Our Lord teaches the same doctrine, both by 
parables and positive assertions. He gives us the history of a man to 
whom his lord and king compassionately "forgave a debt of ten thousand 
talents." This ungrateful wretch, by not forgiving his fellow servant 
who owed him a hundred pence, forfeited his own pardon, and drew upon 
himself the king's heaviest displeasure; "for he was wroth, and 
delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due to 
him;" and to the eternal overthrow of Dr. Crisp's fashionable tenets, 
our Lord adds, "So likewise shall my Father do unto you, if ye from your
 hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses." Agreeably 
to this, he assured His disciples that his Father "pruneth every branch 
in him that beareth fruit, and taketh away every one that beareth not 
fruit;" and to show how far this displeasure may proceed, He observes 
that such a barren branch is "cast forth, is withered, gathered, cast 
into the fire, and burned."  
</p><p>Here, sir, I might add all those scriptures that 
testify the possibility of falling away from the Divine favor. I might 
bring the alarming instances of those apostates who once "tasted the 
good word of God, and the powers of the world to come," and afterward 
"fell from their steadfastness, lost their reward, became enemies to God
 by wicked works, hated the light" which once they rejoiced in, because 
it reproved their evil deeds; "trod under foot the Son of God, forgot 
they were washed from their old sins, and counted the blood of Christ, 
wherewith they were sanctified, an unholy thing." But I refer you, sir, 
to the two John Goodwins of the age, the Rev. Mr. Wesley and the Rev. 
Mr. <i>Sellon, </i>who have so cut down and stripped the <i>Crispian of Immodesty, </i>that
 some people think it actually lies without either root, bark, or 
branches, exposed to the view of those who have courage enough to see 
and think for themselves.  
</p><p>Should all they have advanced to show that "we are
 every hour and every moment pleasing or displeasing to God, according 
to our internal and external works," have no weight with you, let me 
conclude by producing the testimony of two respectable divines, against 
whom you will not enter a protest.  
</p><p>The one is the rector of Loughrea. You tell us, 
sir, in your sermons, page 88, that the acceptance of Cornelius "was not
 absolute" are convened to go in a body to Mr. Wesley's conference, you 
mean no external compulsion. Much less are you authorized to "insist" 
upon his owning himself "a heretic," by these words of the apostle, "As 
much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all <i>men, </i>and esteem 
ministers highly in love for their works' sake." Neither in this 
command, "A heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject," 
&amp;c; for you have neither proved Mr. Wesley a <i>heretic, </i>nor <i>once admonished </i>him as such.  
</p><p>Surely our Lord will not smile upon your 
undertaking; for he has left his sentiments upon record, the reverse of 
your practice. He had said, "Whosoever shall receive," not provoke, "one
 of such children in my name, receiveth me." But John answered him, 
saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad
 him, because he followeth not with us. "Forbid him not," said Jesus, 
"for there is no man who can do a miracle in my name, that can lightly 
speak evil of me." Festus himself, though a poor heathen, will 
disapprove of such a step: "It is not the manner of the Romans," says 
he, "to deliver any man to die," (or to insist on his publicly giving up
 his reputation, which in some cases is worse than death,) "before that 
he who is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to 
answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him." The 
lordliness of your procedure even exceeds, in one respect, the severity 
of the Council of Constance, where poor Jerome of Prague had leave to 
plead his own cause before he was obliged to acknowledge himself an 
heretic; and make "a formal recantation" of the propositions he had 
advanced.  
</p><p>Beside, how could you suppose, sir, that Mr. 
Wesley, and the preachers who shall assemble with him, are such weak men
 as tamely to acknowledge themselves heretics upon your <i>ipse dixit? </i>Suppose
 Mr. Wesley took it in his head to convene all the divines that 
disapprove the extract of Zanchius, to go with him in a body to Mr. 
Toplady's chapel, and demand a formal recantation of that performance, 
as heretical; yea, to insist upon it, before they had "measured swords, 
or broken a pike together." Would not the translator of Zanchius, from 
the ramparts of common sense, deservedly laugh at him, and ask whether 
he thought to frighten him by his protests, and bully him into 
orthodoxy?  
</p><p>O sir, have we not fightings enough <i>without </i>to
 employ all our time and strength? Must we also declare war and promote 
fightings within? Must we catch at every opportunity to stab one 
another, because the livery of truth which we wear is not turned up in 
the same manner? What can be more cruel than this? What can be more 
cutting to an old minister of Christ, than to be traduced as "a dreadful
 heretic," in printed letters sent to the best men in the land, yea, 
through all England and Scotland, and signed by a person of your rank 
and piety; to have things that he knows not, that he never meant, laid 
to his charge, and dispersed far and near? While he is gone to a 
neighboring kingdom to preach Jesus Christ, to have his friends 
prejudiced, his foes elevated, and the fruit of his extensive ministry 
at the point of being blasted! Put yourself in his place, sir, and you 
will see that the wound is deep, and reaches the very heart. I can 
apologize for the other "real Protestants." Some are utter strangers to 
polemic divinity; others are biased by high Calvinism; and one, whose 
name is used, never saw your circular letter till it was in print. But 
what can I say for you, sir? Against hope I must believe in hope, that 
an unaccountable panic influenced your mind, and deprived you for a time
 of the calmness and candor which adorn your natural temper. If this is 
the case, may you act with less precipitancy for the future! And may the
 charity "that hopeth all things, believeth all things, does not 
provoke, and is not provoked," rule in our hearts and lives! So shall 
the heathen world drop their just objections against our unhappy 
divisions, and once more be forced to cry out, "See how these Christians
 love!" And so shall we give over trying to disturb, or pull down a part
 of the Church of Christ, because we dislike the color of the stones 
with which it is built; or because our fellow builders cannot pronounce <i>Shibboleth </i>just as we do.  
</p><p>One word more about Mr. Wesley, and I have done. 
Of the two greatest and most useful ministers I ever knew, one is no 
more. The other, after amazing labors, flies still with unwearied 
diligence through the three kingdoms, calling sinners to repentance, and
 to the healing fountain of Jesus' blood. Though oppressed with the 
weight of near seventy years, and the care of near thirty thousand 
souls, he shames still, by his unabated zeal and immense labors, all the
 young ministers in England, perhaps in Christendom. He has generally 
blown the Gospel trump, and rode twenty miles, before most of the 
professors, who despise his labors, have left their downy pillow. As he 
begins the day, the week, the year, so he concludes them, still intent 
upon extensive services for the glory of the Redeemer, and the good of 
souls. And shall we lightly lift up our pens, our tongues, our hands 
against him? No, let them rather forget their cunning! If we <i>will </i>quarrel, can we find nobody to fall out with but the minister upon whom God puts the greatest honor?  
</p><p>Our Elijah has lately been translated to heaven. 
Gray-headed Elisha is yet awhile continued upon earth. And shall we make
 a hurry and noise, to bring in railing accusations against him with 
more success? While we pretend to a peculiar zeal for Christ's glory, 
shall the very Same spirit be found in us, which made his persecutors 
say, "He hath spoken blasphemy," (or heresy,) "what need we any farther 
witnesses?" Shall the sons of the prophets, shall even children in grace
 and knowledge, openly traduce the venerable seer and his abundant 
labors? When they see him run upon his Lord's errands, shall they cry, 
not, "Go up, thou bald head," but, "Go up, thou heretic?" O Jesus of 
Nazareth, thou rejected of men, thou who wast once called "a deceiver of
 the people," suffer it not! lest the raging bear of persecution come 
suddenly out of the wood upon those sons of discord, and tear them in 
pieces.  
</p><p>And suppose a Noah, an old preacher of 
righteousness, should have really folded under the influence of an 
honest mistake, shall we act a worse part than that of Canaan? Shall we 
make sport of the nakedness which, we say, he has disclosed, when we 
have boldly uncovered it ourselves? O God, do not thou permit it, lest a
 curse of pride, self sufficiency, bigotry, Antinomianism, and bitter 
zeal, come upon us; and lest the children, begotten by our unkind 
preaching and unloving example, walk in our steps and inherit our 
propagated punishment!  
</p><p>Rather may the blessing of <i>peace makers </i>be 
ours. May the meek, loving Spirit of Jesus fill our hearts! May streams,
 not of the bitter waters which cause the curse, but of the living water
 which gladdens the city of God, flow from our catholic breasts, and put
 out the fire of wild zeal and persecuting malice! May we know when Sion
 is really in danger; and when the accuser of the brethren gives a false
 alarum to disturb the peace of the Church, and turn the stream of 
undefiled, lovely, and loving religion, into the miry channel of 
obstinate prejudice, imperious bigotry, and noisy vain jangling. And may
 we at last unanimously worship together in the temple of peace, instead
 of striving for the mastery in the house of discord!  
</p><p>Should this public attempt to stop the war which 
has been publicly declared be in any degree successful, -- should it 
check a little the forwardness that has lately appeared to stir up 
contention, under pretence of opposing heresy, -- should it make warm 
men willing to let the light of their moderation shine before the world,
 and to "keep a conscience void of offence" toward their neighbors, 
instead of openly opposing their liberty of conscience, -- should it 
cause the good that is in an eminent servant of Christ to be less evil 
spoken of, -- and above all, should it convince any of the great 
impropriety of exposing precious truths as "dreadful heresies;" and of 
preferring the gospel of Dr. Crisp to "the truth as it is in Jesus," -- I
 shall be less grieved at having been obliged to expostulate with you, 
sir, in this public manner.  
</p><p>In hopes this will be the case, and with a heart 
full of ardent wishes that all our unhappy divisions may end in a 
greater union, I remain, Hon. and Rev, sir, your obedient servant in the
 peaceable Gospel of Jesus Christ,
