</p><p align="center">SECTION I.  
</p><p>Mr. Hill endeavours to screen his mistakes, by presenting the world with a wrong view of the controversy.  
</p><p align="center">SECTION II.  
</p><p>His charge, that the practical religion

</p><p>Mr. Hill's faint attempt to show that his scheme

</p><p>At Mr. Hill's special request, Mr. Fulsome, (a 
gross Antinomian, first introduced to the world by Mr. Berridge,) is 
brought upon the stage of controversy. Mr. Berridge attempts in vain to 
bind him with Calvinistic cords.  
</p><p align="center">SECTION V.  
</p><p>Mr. Hill cannot defend his doctrines of grace 
before the judicious, by producing a list of the gross Antinomians that 
may be found in Mr. Wesley's societies.  
</p><p align="center">SECTION VI.  
</p><p>Mr. Hill, after passing over the arguments and

</p><p>His moral creed about faith and works is incompatible with his immoral system.  
</p><p align="center">SECTION VIII.  
</p><p>He raises a cloud of dust about a fair, though

</p><p align="center">AN ANSWER 
</p><p align="center">To 
</p><p align="center">THE FINISHING STROKE 
</p><p align="center">OF RICHARD HILL, ESQ. 
</p><p>HON. AND DEAR SIR,I have received your <i>Finishing Stroke, </i>and
 return the following answer to you; or, if you have quitted the field, 
to your pious second, the Rev. Mr. Berridge, who, by a public attack 
upon <i>sincere obedience, </i>and upon the doctrine of a believer's <i>justification by works, and not by faith only, </i>has already entered the lists in your place.  
</p><p>Sec. i, p. 6. You complain that I represent you as
 fighting the battles of the rankest Antinomians, "because (say you) we 
firmly believe and unanimously assert, that 'the blood of Christ 
cleanseth from all sin,' and that, 'if any man sin, we have an Advocate 
with the Father,' &amp;c, and that this advocacy prevails." Not so, dear
 sir: I apprehend you give your readers totally wrong ideas of the 
question. You know I never opposed you for saying that "the blood of 
Christ cleanseth <i>penitent believers </i>from all sin." On the 
contrary, this I insist upon in a fuller sense than you do, who, if I 
mistake not, suppose that death, and not the blood of Christ, applied by
 the sanctifying Spirit, is to be our cleanser from all sin. The point 
which we debate is not then whether Christ's blood cleanses from all 
sin, but whether it actually cleanses from all guilt an impenitent 
backslider, a filthy apostate; and whether God says to the fallen 
believer, that commits adultery and murder, "Thou art all fair, my love,
 my undefiled, there is no spot in thee." This you affirm in your fourth
 letter; and this I expose as the very quintessence of Ranterism, 
Antinomianism, and Calvinistic perseverance.  
</p><p>The second part of your mistake is yet more 
glaring than the first. The question is not, (as you inform your 
readers,) whether, if "any man sin, we have an Advocate with the 
Father," &amp;c. You know, sir, that far from denying this comfortable 
truth, I maintain it in full opposition to your narrow system, which 
declares that if any man, who is passed by or non-elected, sinneth, 
there is no advocate with the Father for him: and that there are 
thousands of absolutely reprobated wretches, born to have the devil for a
 tempter and an accuser, without any help from our Redeemer and 
Advocate.  
</p><p>Nor yet do we debate whether Christ's advocacy 
prevails in the full extent of the word, for all that know the day of 
their visitation this is a point of doctrine in which I am as clear as 
yourself. But the question about which we divide is, (1.) Whether 
Christ's advocacy never prevails when he asks that barren fig trees, 
which are at last cut down, for persisting in their unfruitfulness, may 
be "spared this year also?" (2.) Whether it prevails in such a manner 
for all those, who once made ever so weak an act of true faith, that 
they shall never "make shipwreck of the faith," never "deny the Lord 
that bought them," and "bring upon themselves swift destruction?" (3.) 
Whether Aaron and Korab, David and Demas, Solomon and Hymeneus, Peter 
and Judas, Philetus and Francis Spira, with all that fall from God, 
shall infallibly sing louder in heaven for their grievous falls on 
earth? In a word, whether the salvation of some, and the damnation of 
others, are so finished, that, during "the day of their visitation," it 
is absolutely impossible for one of the former to draw back to perdition
 from a state of salvation; and for one of the latter to draw back to 
salvation from a state of perdition?  
</p><p>These important questions you should have laid 
before your readers as the very ground of our controversy. But instead 
of this you amuse them with two precious scriptures, which I hold in a 
fuller sense than yourself. This is a stroke of your logic, but it is 
not the finishing one, for you say: Sec. ii, p. 6. "We cannot admit the
 contrary doctrine [that of the Checks] without at once undermining both
 law and Gospel. For the Jaw is certainly undermined by supposing that 
any breach of it whatever is not attended with the curse of God." What 
law do I undermine? Is it the law of innocence? No: for I insist upon it
 as well as you, to convince unhumbled sinners that there can be no 
salvation but in and through a Mediator. Is it the Mediator's law, "the 
law of liberty?" Certainly not: for I defend it against the bold attacks
 you make upon it; and shall now ward off the dreadful blow you give it 
in this argument.  
</p><p>O sir, is it right to confound, as you do, the law
 of paradisiacal innocence with the evangelical law of liberty, that in 
point of personal, sincere obedience, you may set both aside at one 
stroke? Is not this Calvinistic stroke as dangerous as it is 
unscriptural? "There is no law but one which damns for want of absolute 
innocence: all those that are under any law, must be under this law, 
which curses for a wandering thought as well as for incest. But 
believers are not cursed for a wandering thought. Therefore they are 
under no law: they are not cursed even for incest; they may break their 
'rule of life' by adultery, as David, or by incest, as the unchaste 
Corinthian, without falling under the curse of any Divine law in force 
against them: in a word, without ceasing to be men 'after God's own 
heart.'"  
</p><p>Now whence arises the fallacy of this argument? Is
 it not from overlooking the Mediator's law, the law of Christ? Can you 
see no medium between being under "a rule of life," the breaking of 
which shall "work for our good," and being under a law that curses to 
the pit of hell for the least want of absolute innocence? Between those 
two extremes is there not the evangelical "law of liberty?"  
</p><p>O sir, be not mistaken: the Gospel has its law. Hear St. Paul:  
</p><p>"God shall JUDGE the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to <i>my Gospel," </i>Rom.
 ii, 16. Hear St. James: "So speak ye [believers] and so do, as they 
that shall be judged by the LAW OF LIBERTY; for he [the believer] shall 
have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy," James ii, 12, 
13, illustrated by Matt. xviii, 2335  
</p><p>Christ is neither an Eli nor a Nero, neither a 
dolt nor a tyrant; but a priestly king, a "Melchisedec." If he is a 
king, he has a law; his subjects may, and the disobedient shall, be 
condemned by it. If he is a priestly king, he has a gracious law; and if
 he has a gracious law, he requires no absolute impossibilities. Thus 
the covenant of grace keeps a just medium between the relentless 
severity of the first covenant, and the Antinomian softness of the 
covenant trumpeted by some Calvinists.  
</p><p>Be not then frightened, O Sion, from meditating in
 Christ's law day and night; for it is the law of thy gracious "King, 
who cometh unto the meek, and sitting upon the foal" of a mild, pacific 
animal: and not that of thy fierce and fond monarch, O Geneva, who comes
 riding upon the wings of storms and tempests, to damn the reprobates 
for the preordained, unavoidable consequences of Adam's preordained, 
unavoidable sin; and to encourage fallen believers, that climb up into 
their neighbours' beds, by saying to each of them, "Thou art all fair, 
my love, my undefiled, there is no spot in thee." But more of this to 
Mr. Berridge. When you have given us a wrong idea of the Mediator's law,
 you proceed to do the same by the Gospel, with which that law is so 
closely connected. For you say: Page 6. "The Gospel is certainly 
undermined, by supposing that there is provision made in it for some 
sins, and not for others." Well then, sir, Christ and the four 
evangelists have "certainly undermined the Gospel;" for they all mention
 the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, "the sin unto death," or the sin 
of final impenitency and unbelief; and they not only suppose, but 
expressly declare, that it is a sin for which "no provision is made," 
and the punishment of which obstinate unbelievers and apostates must 
personally bear. Is it not strange that the capital doctrine by which 
our Lord guards his own Gospel, should be represented as a capital 
error, by which "the Gospel is certainly undermined?"  
</p><p>Sec. iii, p. 6. To show that your scheme is 
different from speculative Antinomianism, you ask, "Is the experience of
 David, Lot, and Solomon, that of all those who abide by those 
doctrines?" I answer, It may be that of thousands for aught you know, 
and if it is not that of myriads, no thanks to you, sir, for you have 
given them encouragement enough: (though I still do you the justice to 
say, you have done it undesignedly:) and lest they should forget your 
former innuendo, in this very page you say, that "the covenant of grace 
[including, no doubt, finished salvation] standeth sure in behalf of the
 elect, under every trial, state, and circumstance they can possibly be 
in;" which, if I mistake not, implies, that they may be in the 
impenitent "state" of drunken Lot, and adulterous David, or in the 
dangerous "circumstance" of idolatrous Solomon, and the incestuous 
Corinthian, without being less interested in finished salvation than if 
they served God with Noah, Job, and Daniel. To this answer I add 
Flavel's judicious observation: "If the principle will yield it, it is 
in vain to think corrupt nature will not catch at it, and make a vile 
use and dangerous improvement of it." But you state, (p. 7,) "You know 
in your conscience that we detest and abhor that damnable doctrine and 
position of real Antinomians: 'Let us sin, that grace may abound.'" I 
believe, dear sir, that all pious Calvinists, and consequently you, 
abhor that horrible tenet practically, so far as you are saved from sin.
 And yet, to the great encouragement of practical Antinomianism, you 
have made an enumeration of the good that sin, yea, any length in sin, 
unto adultery, robbery, murder, and incest, does to the pleasant 
children. You have assured them that sin shall work for their good; and 
you have closed the strange plea by saying, that "a grievous fall will 
make them sing louder the praises of free, restoring grace, to all 
eternity in heaven." Now, honoured sir, pardon me if I tell you my whole
 mind. Really, to this day, I think, that if I wanted to make Christ 
publicly the minister of sin, and to poison the minds of my hearers by 
preaching an Antinomian sermon from these words, <i>Let us sin, that grace </i>may <i>abound, I </i>could
 not do it more effectually than by showing, according to the doctrine 
of your fourth letter: (l.) That, upon the whole, sin can do us no harm.
 (2.) That, far from hurting us, it will work for our good. And, (3.) 
That even a grievous fall into adultery and murder will make us "sing 
louder in heaven; all debts and claims against believers, be they more 
or be they less, be they small or be they great, be they before or be 
they after conversion, being for ever and for ever cancelled by Christ's
 fulfilling the law for them." In the name of reason, I ask, Where is 
the difference between publishing these unguarded tenets and saying 
roundly, <i>Let us sin, that grace may abound?</i>  
</p><p>Do not reply, sir, that this objection was brought
 against St. Paul as well as against you, and therefore the apostle's 
doctrine and yours exactly coincide; for this would be impeaching the 
innocent to screen the guilty. The charge of indirectly saying, "Let us 
sin, that grace may abound," is absolutely false, when it is brought 
against St. Paul; but alas, it is too true when produced against the 
author of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis. </i>Where did that holy apostle ever say
 that sin works for our good? When did he declare that the Lord 
overrules sin, even adultery and murder, for the good of his backsliding
 people; and that grievous falls in this world will make us more joyful 
in the next? But you know, sir, who has published those maxims, and who 
stands to them, even in a <i>Finishing Stroke: </i>intimating still, 
that it is God's "secret will" to do good to his people by "the 
abominable thing which his soul hateth," (p. 55, 1. 36, &amp;c.) O sir, 
hell is not farther from heaven than this doctrine from that of the 
apostle: for while you absolutely promise fallen believers louder songs 
in heaven, he conditionally threatens them with "much sorer punishment" 
in hell, Heb. x, 29, and Christ says, "Go and sin no more, lest a worse 
thing happen unto thee." But your scheme says, "Go any length in sin, 
and a more excellent thing shall happen unto thee: a <i>grievous fall will drive thee nearer to Christ."</i>  
</p><p>Leaving you to reconcile yourself with holy Paul 
and our blessed Lord, I beg leave to account for the warmth with which 
you sometimes plead for and sometimes against sin. As a good man, you 
undoubtedly "detest and abhor" this dangerous maxim of the great Diana 
of the Antinomians; "sin works for good to believers;" but, as a sound 
Calvinist, you plead for it, yea, and you father it upon the apostle 
too. (See Third Check, p. 186.) This contrariety, in your sentiments, 
may be illustrated by Judah's inconsistent behaviour to Tamar  
</p><p>As Tamar was an agreeable woman, Judah took an 
Antinomian fancy to her, gave her his "signet, bracelets, and stall;" 
for a pledge; and faithfully "sent her a kid from the flock." But as she
 was his disgraced daughter-in-law, big with a bastard child, though he 
himself was the father of it, he rose against her with uncommon 
indignation, and said, in a fit of legality, "Bring her forth that she 
may be burnt!" O! that instead of calling me "a spiritual calumniator," 
and accusing me of "vile falsehood and gross perversion," for bearing 
testimony against a similar inconsistency, you would imitate the 
undeceived patriarch, take your signet and bracelets again; I mean, call
 in your fourth letter, that fatal pledge sent me from the press of your
 great Diana, and from this time "know her again no more!"<i> </i>Gen. xxxviii, 26.  
</p><p>Sec. iv. But you are not put out of countenance by
 your former mistakes, for, (pp. 8, 9,) speaking, it seems, of those 
mistaken good men, "who say more at times for sin than against it," or 
of those who traduce obedience, and make void the law through faith, 
representing it as a bare rule of life, the breaking of which will in 
the end work for the believer's good, you say, "Though I have begged you
 so earnestly in my Review to point out by name who these wretches [you 
should say these <i>persons</i>]<i> </i>are: though I have told you that
 without this the charge of slander must be for ever at your door; still
 neither they nor their converts are produced; no, nor one quotation 
from their writings, in order to prove these black charges upon them." 
Here is a heap of gross mistakes. I have not only produced one 
quotation, but many both from Dr. Crisp's writings and your own. See 
Second Check, from p. 115 to 118, and Third Check, from p. 176 to p. 
191. Again: that "neither they nor their converts are produced," is a 
capital oversight. Turn to Fourth Check, p. 282: "Produce a few of 
them," says your brother; to which I answer, "Well, sir, I produce, 
first, the author of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis, </i>next yourself, and then 
all the Calvinists who admire your brother's fourth letter, where he not
 only insinuates, but openly attempts to prove, that David, &amp;c, 
stood absolved and complete in the everlasting righteousness of Christ, 
while his eyes were full of adultery and his hands of blood. Now, sir, 
if this was the case of David, it may not only be the case of many, but 
of all the elect:"<i> </i>for the imaginary covenant of finished 
salvation stands as sure for fallen believers, who cheat, swear, and get
 drunk, as for those who commit adultery, murder, arid incest.  
</p><p>But since you press me still to produce witnesses,
 I promise you to produce by and by the Rev. Mr. Berridge, your second, 
together with his Antinomian pleas against sincere obedience. In the 
meantime I produce "Mr. Fulsome," together with a quotation from "The 
Christian World Unmasked." It contains a ludicrous description of a 
consistent Antinomian, brought over to the doctrines of grace by, I know
 not which of our Gospel ministers.  
</p><p>His name, says Mr. Berridge, was Mr. Fulsome, and 
his mother's maiden name was Miss Wanton. "When the cloth was removed, 
and some few tankards had gone round, Mr. Fulsome's face looked like the
 red lion painted on my landlord's sign, and his mouth began to open. He
 talked swimmingly about religion, and vapoured much in praise of 
[Calvinistic] perseverance. Each fresh tankard threw a fresh light upon 
his subject, &amp;c. No sin; he said, can hurt me. I have had a call, 
and my election is safe. Satan may pound me, if he please:  
</p><p>but Jesus must replevy me. What care I for 
drunkenness or whoredom, for cheating, or a little lying? These sins may
 hurt another, but they cannot hurt me. Let me wander where I will from 
God, Jesus Christ must fetch me back again. I may fall a thousand times,
 but I shall rise again: yes, I may fall exceeding foully. And so he 
did, for instantly he pitched with his head upon the floor, and the 
tankard in his hand." <i>(Christian World Unmasked. </i>2d ed. p. 191.)  
</p><p>Thus fell the Antinomian champion of Calvinistic 
perseverance. "The tankard (adds Mr. Berridge) was recovered, but no one
 thought it worth his while to lift up Mr. Fulsome." And what does Mr. 
Fulsome care for it, if Jesus Christ himself is absolutely engaged to 
raise him up, though he had spilt not only some of my landlord's ale, 
but all my landlord's blood? Let Mr. Fulsome take a peaceful nap upon 
the floor, till he can call for another tankard; it will never hurt him,
 for Mr. Hill declares that "the covenant of grace standeth sure in 
behalf of the elect under every trial, state, and circumstance they can 
possibly be in: and that God overrules sin for their good." <i>(Finishing Stroke, </i>pp. 6, and 55.)  
</p><p>Upon the principles of Calvinism, no logician in 
the world can, I think, find a flaw in the following arguments of Mr. 
Fulsome:If I am unconditionally elected, irresistible grace will 
certainly save me at last; nay, my salvation is already finished: and 
for this tankard and twenty more, I shall only sing "louder" in heaven 
the praises of free, distinguishing, restoring grace, which, passing by 
thousands, viewed me with unchangeable love, and determined to save me 
with an everlasting salvation, without any regard to that "Jack 
o'lantern, sincere obedience." If, on the other hand, I am 
unconditionally reprobated, I shall absolutely be damned. Again: 
supposing Christ never died for me, not only all my faith, but also all 
my endeavours and works, (were they as many as those of Mr. J. W.) like a
 "Jack o'lantern," will only dance before me to the pit of hell. Once 
more: if I am absolutely justified, it is not all the tankards and 
harlots in the world that can blot my name out of the book of life. And 
if I am in the black book, my damnation is as good as finished. My 
sincere obedience will never reverse a personal, absolute decree, older 
and firmer than the pillars of heaven. Nay, it may be the readiest way 
to hell: for our vicar, who is one of the first Gospel ministers in the 
kingdom, tells us, that "the devil was surely the author of the 
condition of sincere obedience," and that "thousands have been lost by 
following after it." Landlord, bring in another tankard. Here is the 
health of all who do not legalize the Gospel  
</p><p>Mr. Berridge is too good a logician to attempt 
proving that Mr. Fulsome's creed is not quite rational, upon the 
principles of Calvinism. He only says, (p. 192,) "Such scandalous 
professors are found at all times, in our day, and in St. Paul's day, 
yet St. Paul will not renounce the doctrine of perseverance." True; he 
will not renounce his own doctrine of conditional perseverance, because 
it is the very reverse of the doctrine of absolute, or Calvinistic 
perseverance, from which Mr. Fulsome draws his horrible, and yet just 
inferences.  
</p><p>But, <i>says </i>Mr. B., (p. 178,) "A believer's 
new nature makes him hunger for implanted righteousness;" insinuating 
that a believer's holy nature puts him upon such spontaneous obedience 
to his "rules of life," that he needs not the help of a law, as a ride 
of rewards and punishments, to encourage him in the path of duty, and to
 keep him from the broad way of disobedience. As this is one of the 
grand arguments by which pious Calvinists defend the Antinomian Babel, I
 shall answer it first as an anti-Calvinist, and Mr. Fulsome next as a 
Calvinist.  
</p><p>1. Experience shows, that to secure the creature's
 obedience, or the Creator's honour, the curb of a law is necessary for 
all free agents who are yet in a state of probation; and that so long as
 we are surrounded with so many temptations to faint in duty, and to 
leave the thorny way of the cross for the flowery paths of sin, the spur
 and bridle of a promising and threatening law are needful, even with 
respect to those duties which natural or supernatural inclination 
renders in general delightful; such as for mothers to take care of their
 own children, and believers to do good to their own neighbour. Now as 
the civil law, that condemns murderers to death, does not except mothers
 who destroy the fruit of their womb, because natural affection makes 
them in general glad to preserve it; so the penal law of Christ makes no
 exception in favour of believers who fall into adultery and murder, 
under the Calvinistic pretence that their new nature makes them in 
general hunger after purity and love. See I Cor. vi, 8, 9. Again: all 
sophisms flee before matter of fact. Fallen angels and our first parents
 once naturally hungered after righteousness, more than most believers 
do; and yet they grossly apostatized. And if you object to these 
instances, I produce David and the incestuous Corinthian: both had a 
"new nature" as believers; and yet as fallen believers, the one could 
thirst after Uriah's blood, and the other hunger after his father's 
wife, far more than after "implanted righteousness." But,  
</p><p>2. Mr. Fulsome may answer Mr. Berridge as a 
Calvinist thus:My new nature will make me hunger for implanted 
righteousness "in the day of God's power:<i>" </i>God will do his own 
work: in the meantime I am "in a winter season:", "I am carnal and sold 
under sin," as well as St. Paul, and I thirst after my tankard as David 
did after Bathsheba's beauty, and Uriah's blood: thus the Antinomian gap
 remains as wide as ever.  
</p><p>It is true also that Mr. Berridge says, (p. 173,) 
"Cheats will arise: and how must we deal with them? Deal with them, sir!
 why, hang them, when detected; as Jesus hanged Judas." I thought that 
Judas, and not Jesus, was the hangman. But I let that pass, to observe, 
that Mr. Fulsome may justly ask, Why will you hang me? Does not our 
Lord, speaking of his elect, say, "He that touches you, touches the 
apple of mine eye?" If Mr. Berridge answers, You are no elect; you are a
 hypocrite; you never had grace: Mr. Fulsome may justly reply, upon the 
plan of the Calvinistic doctrines of grace, "I have had a call, and my 
election is safe. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? 
Whom he called, them he also justified: yea, they are justified from all
 things. You have no more right to condemn me as a hypocrite, because 
you see me with a tankard in my band, than to pass a sentence of 
hypocrisy upon all backsliders. How will you prove that I have not as 
much right to toss my tankard, as David to write a sanguinary letter; 
Solomon to worship devils; and the incestuous Corinthian to invade the 
rights of his father's bed? I will maintain the privileges of God's 
children against all the legalists and the Wesleys in the world: I will 
fight for free grace to the last drop in my tankard: my service to you!"
  
</p><p>If Mr. Fulsome's arguments are conclusive, as well
 as Calvinistical, how can he be brought to give up his Antinomian 
creed? Undoubtedly, by being brought to give up Calvinism. Till then it 
is evident that he will still hold his doctrines of grace in theory, or 
in practice: indirectly and with mental reserves, as all pious 
Calvinists do; or openly and without shuffling, as he does in his 
confession of faith. Thus has Mr. Berridge presented the world with an 
Antinomian creed as horrid as that which I have composed with the 
unguarded principles of your fourth letter. And by acknowledging that 
"such scandalous professors as Mr. Fulsome are found at all times," he 
has confirmed the necessity of my Checks, shown they are really Checks 
to Antinomianism, and not "Checks to the Gospel," silenced those who 
have accused me of misrepresentation, and helped me to give the world a 
just idea of Calvinistic principles. I say principles, because many, 
very many Calvinists, like Mr. Berridge, are too moral not to reject in 
their practice, and not to explode as detestable in their discourse, the
 immoral inferences consistent Antinomians justly draw from their 
doctrines of grace.  
</p><p>Sec. v. Having thus complied with your request, 
sir, by producing "a quotation" from an eminent Calvinist divine, to 
show that I do not fight against a shadow when I oppose Mr. Fulsome; and
 having described a rational "convert" to your doctrines of grace, I 
return to the <i>Finishing Stroke, </i>where, to ward off the blow given to your system by the orthodoxy and bad conduct of the Fulsomes,  
</p><p>Page 9. You offer to show me "a long black list of
 deluded creatures, (some of whom have been principal leaders in Mr. 
Wesley's classes, &amp;c,) who have been carrying on abominations, and 
wicked practices under the mask of religion." And you tell us they are 
"some of the fruits which the doctrines" of Mr. Wesley "have produced." 
But you have forgot the proof, unless you think that your bare assertion
 is quite sufficient. Suppose that one out of twelve of Mr. Wesley's 
class leaders had actually turned out a "temporary monster," what could 
you infer from it against Mr. Wesley's doctrine, but what the Pharisees 
could, with equal truth, or rather with equal justice, have inferred 
against the doctrine of our Lord?  
</p><p>By what plain and easy consequence, or by what 
Scriptural argument will you make it appear that even the most abhorred 
of all Mr. Wesley's doctrines, that of Christian perfection, (or, which 
is all one, that of believing in Christ with a penitential faith, till 
we love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves,) has any
 more tendency to turn his hearers into "temporary monsters," than our 
Lord's sermon upon the mount had to turn his apostles into covetous 
traitors? But how can you free your doctrine from the dangerous 
consequences which flow from it as naturally as a river does from its 
source? Have I not just proved, I hope to the satisfaction of judicious 
readers, that Mr. Fulsome's practice perfectly agrees with your 
Calvinistic principles? O sir, that vapourer, in favour of your 
perseverance, fairly and consistently builds upon what your brother 
calls "the foundation of the Calvinists," that is, unconditional 
election and finished salvation: he is a wise master builder. Apply the 
most exact plummet of reason to the walls of his Antinomian Babel, and 
you will find them straight. They do not project a hair's breadth from 
your doctrines of grace, which are the foundations laid in some our 
celebrated pulpits for him and all the clan of the Fulsomes to build 
upon. He is a judicious monster; he has reason and your orthodoxy on his
 side. But the monsters of your long black list (supposing it to be a 
true one) are barefaced hypocrites, equally condemned by their reason 
and profession: for, so far as they adhere to Mr. Wesley's doctrine, 
their principles are diametrically opposed to their practice, and 
therefore he is no more accountable for their "abominations" than our 
Lord was for Judas' treason.  
</p><p>Sec. vi, pp. 12, 13. You leave me in full 
possession of the scriptures, arguments, and quotations from our 
homilies and liturgy which I have advanced in the Fourth Check, 
supposing that when you have called them "the novel chimeras of the 
Fourth Check," or a "mingle mangle;" and that when you have referred 
your readers to "the faith of Mr. Ignorance," you have given my 
sentiments a <i>Finishing Stroke. </i>To such forcible arguments I can make no better and shorter reply than that of my title page, <i>Logica Genevensis! </i>However,  
</p><p>Page 11. You decide that my illustration of the 
woman dropping her child down the precipice "is totally foreign to the 
purpose," i.e. does not at all prove that Calvinism fathers "unprovoked 
wrath" upon the God of love. But how do you make it appear? Why, you 
insinuate that "man has forfeited all right and title to the favour of 
God by his fall in Adam;" and therefore God has been justly provoked to 
drop the reprobates down the precipice of sin into hell, by an eternal, 
unconditional, absolute decree of non-election.  
</p><p>The argument is specious, and has deceived 
thousands of simple souls into Calvinism: but can it bear examination? 
Who, or what provoked God to make, from all eternity, a decree of 
absolutely dropping Adam down the precipice of sin, and the reprobated 
part of his posterity down the precipice of damnation? Was it the sin of
 reprobates? No: for millions of them are as yet unconceived, and 
therefore sinless; for what has not yet a substance cannot yet have a 
mode; what does not yet exist cannot yet be sinful. Was it a foresight 
of their sin? No:  
</p><p>for, upon the Calvinistic plan, God certainly 
foresees what will happen, only because he has absolutely decreed what 
shall happen. Was it Adam's sin, as you insinuate? No: for Adam's sin 
was committed in time, and therefore could not influence an absolute 
decree of personal reprobation made before time, yea, from all eternity.
 But you add: Pages 11, 12, "If you believe that the transgression of 
our first parent entailed no condemnation upon his posterity, why did 
you subscribe to the ninth article of our Church, which says, that <i>in every man born into the world it deserves God's wrath and damnation?" </i>I
 apprehend you mistake, sir: that article says no such thing. What it 
affirms of a derivation of Adam's corruption, or of "the fault and 
corruption of the nature of every man, "you represent as spoken of 
Adam's personal transgression; which is absolutely confounding the cause
 and the effect. Every anti-Calvinist may, and I, for one, do believe, 
that <i>in every man born into the world, </i>and considered according 
to the first covenant, original corruption (not Adam's transgression) 
deserves God's wrath and damnation at the hands of a holy and righteous 
God, without dreaming that any man shall be ever damned for it: seeing 
that according to God's mercy and goodness displayed in the second 
covenant, Christ, "the second Adam," is come "to taste death for every 
man;" and to be "the Saviour of all men;" so that for his sake "the free
 gift is come upon all men to justification of life." (See the <i>Fourth Check, </i>p.
 283, &amp;c.) Thus, by looking at our Divine compass, the word of God, 
we sail through the straits of error, keeping at an equal distance from 
the rocks against which Calvinists run on the right hand, and the 
Pelagians on the left.  
</p><p>I have warded off the <i>Stroke </i>which you have
 attempted to give my sentiments with our ninth article; and now it is 
but just you should suffer me to return it. If I am not mistaken, that 
article is repugnant to Calvinism in two respects. (1.) It says not one 
word about the imputation of the demerits of Adam's first transgression;
 but makes original sin to consist only in the "infection of our 
nature;" which saps the foundation of your imaginary imputation of 
Adam's personal sin, and consequently ruins its counterpart, namely, 
your imaginary imputation of Christ's personal good works distinct from 
some actual participation of his holiness. (2.) It affirms that this 
infection, in every person born into the world, deserves God's wrath: a 
strong intimation this that it did not actually deserve that wrath 
before we were actually defiled by a sinful birth or conception. Now 
this, if I mistake not, implies, that of all the men now living upon the
 earth, not one actually deserved God's wrath and damnation two hundred 
years ago. So that if God absolutely reprobated one man now living, 
three hundred, much more six thousand years ago, much more from all 
eternity, he did it according to Calvin's doctrine of rich, free, 
unprovoked, gratuitous, undeserved wrath. O ye considerate Englishmen, 
stand to your articles, and you will soon shake off Geneva impositions! 
 
</p><p>Sec. vii, p. 12. You say in your moral creed about
 faith and works: "Faith when genuine will always manifest its reality 
by bringing forth good works, and all the fruits of a holy life." Now, 
sir, if you stand to this, without secret reserves about "a winter 
state," in which a genuine believer (so called) may commit adultery, 
murder, and incest, for many months, without losing the character of "a 
man after God's own heart," and his title to heaven; you make up the 
Antinomian gap, you set your seal to St. James' Epistle, you ratify the 
Checks; and consequently you give up your fourth letter, which contains 
the very marrow of Calvinism: unless, <i>by </i>some salvo of Geneva 
logic, you can reconcile these two propositions, which, upon the 
rational and moral plan of the Gospel, appear to me utterly 
irreconcilable. (1.) Faith, when genuine, always brings forth all the 
fruits of a holy life. (2.) A man's faith may be genuine while he goes 
any length in sin, and brings forth all the fruits of an unholy 
lifeadultery and murder not excepted. Sec. viii. My quotation from Dr. 
Owen, which sets Calvinistic contradiction in a most glaring light, 
seems to embarrass you much, (p. 14, &amp;c.) You produce passage upon 
passage out of his writings to show that he explodes "the distinction of
 a double justification." But you know, sir, the doctor had as much 
right to contradict himself in his writings as you to militate against 
yourself in your Review. (See <i>Fourth Check, </i>letter i.) Beside, I have already observed, <i>(Fourth Check, </i>letter
 x,) that "a volume of such passages, instead of invalidating the 
doctrine I maintain, (or the quotation I produce,) would only prove that
 the most judicious Calvinists cannot make their scheme hang tolerably 
together." However, you say,  
</p><p>Pages 13, 14. "He [Dr. Owen] drops not the least 
intimation of any fresh act of justification which is then to pass upon a
 believer's person." What, sir, has not the doctor said, in his Treatise
 upon Justification, (p. 222,) "Whenever this inquiry is made, not how a
 sinner, &amp;c, shall be justified, which is [as we are all agreed, by 
faith, or to use the doctor's unscriptural phrase] by the righteousness 
of Christ alone imputed to him; but how a man that professes evangelical
 faith in Christ shall be tried and judged; and whereon, as such, [that 
is, as a believer,] he shall be justified: we grant that it is, and must
 be by his own personal obedience." Now, sir, if the doctor has said 
this, and you dare not deny it, has he not said the very thing which I 
contend for?  
</p><p>When you affirm that he makes no mention of a 
fresh act of justification, do you not betray your inattention? Does he 
not declare that a sinner is justified by imputed righteousness, and 
that a believer as such shall be tried and justified by his own personal
 obedience? Now, if justification is the act of justifying, are you not 
greatly mistaken, when you represent the justification of a sinner by 
Christ's imputed righteousness, and the justification of a believer, or a
 saint, by his own personal obedience, as one and the same act? Permit 
me, sir, to refer you to the argument contained in the <i>Fourth Check, </i>p.
 213; on which, next to the words of our Lord, Matt. xii, 37, I chiefly 
rest our controversy about justification. An argument, the answering of 
which (if it can be answered) would have done your cause more honour and
 service than what you are pleased to insinuate next concerning Mr. 
Wesley's honesty and mine.  
</p><p>D. Williams, out of whose book I copied my 
quotation from Dr. Owen, being a Calvinist, and as clear about a 
sinner's justification by faith as Dr. Owen himself, for brevity's sake,
 left out what the doctor says about it under the Calvinistic phrase of <i>Christ's imputed righteousness. </i>Here,
 as if D. Williams' wisdom were duplicity in me, (p. 14,) you triumph 
not only over me, but over Mr. Wesley, thus: "I never dare trust to Mr. 
Wesley or Mr. Fletcher in any quotations, &amp;c. More words expunged by
 Mr. Fletcher out of the short quotation he has taken from Dr. Owen." 
But suppose I had <i>knavishly expunged </i>the words which D. Williams <i>wisely left out </i>as
 useless to his point, what need was there of reflecting upon Mr. Wesley
 on the occasion? O ye doctrines of free grace and free wrath, how long 
will ye mislead good men? How long will ye hurry them into that part of 
practical Antinomianism which consists in rash accusations of their 
opponents, in a lordly contempt of their gracious attainments, and in 
repeated insinuations that they pay no regard to common honesty?  
</p><p>When a combatant is too warm, he frequently gives 
an unexpected advantage to his antagonist. You are an instance of it, 
sir; your eagerness to reflect upon Mr. Wesley and me, has engaged you 
to present the world with a clause, which, though it was useless to the 
question debated by D. Williams, is of singular use to me in the present
 controversy, and in a manner decides the point. For in the passage left
 out by D. Williams, Dr. Owen speaks of the justification of a sinner, 
and says, as I have observed, that he is "justified by the righteousness
 of Christ alone, imputed to him: and this justification he evidently 
opposes to that of a believer, which" says he, "is and must be by his 
own personal obedience." So that the world (thanks be to your 
controversial heat!*) sees now that even your champion, in one of those 
happy moments when the great Diana did not stand in his light, saw, and 
held forth the important distinction between St. Paul's and St. 
James'-justification, that is, between the justification of a sinner by 
Christ's proper merits, according to the first Gospel axiom; and the 
justification of a saint by his own personal obedience of faith, or by 
Christ's derived merits, according to the second Gospel axiom.  
</p><p>[ * The second instance of this heat, so favourable to my cause, may be seen in the appendix, (No. 10.)] 
</p><p>Nor is this a new distinction, you would say, a 
"novel chimera," among Protestants: for, looking lately in a treatise 
upon good works, written by La Placette, that famous Protestant champion
 and confessor abroad, who, after be had left his native country for 
righteousness' sake, was minister of the French Church at Copenhagen, p.
 272, Amst. Edition, 1700, I fell upon this passage:" <i>Les Protestants de leur cote distinguent ena double justification, celle du peclieur, et celle du juste,"</i> <i> </i>
</p><p><i>4.c. </i>That is, "Protestants on their part 
distinguish a two-fold justification, that of the sinner and that of the
 righteous," &amp;c. Then speaking of the latter, he adds, "The 
justification of the righteous, considered as an act of God, implies 
three things: (1.) That God acknowledges for righteous him that is 
actually so. (2.) That he declares him such. And, (3.) That he treats 
him as such." How different is this threefold act of God from that which
 constitutes a sinner's justification? For this justification, being 
also considered as the act of God, implies:  
</p><p>(l.) That he pardons the sinner. (2.) That he 
admits him to his favour. And, (3.) That, under the Christian 
dispensation, he witnesses this double mercy to the believing sinner's 
heart, by giving him a sense of "the peace which passes all 
understanding," and a taste of the "glory which shall be revealed." 
However, as if all this was a mere "chimera," you say, Page 17. "Having
 fully vindicated Dr. Owen from the charge you have brought against him 
of holding two justifications," &amp;c. Nay, sir, you have not 
vindicated him at all in this respect. All that you have proved, is, 
that he was no stranger to your logic, and that his love for the great 
Diana of the Calvinists made him inconsistently deny at one time what at
 another time his hatred of sin forced him to confess. Nor is this a few
 thing in mystic Geneva: you know, sir, a pious gentleman, who, after 
militating in a book called the Review against the declarative 
justification by works, which I contend for, drops these words, which 
deserve to be graven in brass, as an eternal monument of Calvinistic 
contradiction:" Neither Mr. Shirley, nor I, nor any Calvinist, that I 
ever heard of, denies that a sinner [should you not have said a 
believer?] is declaratively justified by works, both here and at the day
 of judgment." <i>(Review, </i>p. 149.) Now, if no Calvinist you ever 
heard of denies, in his luminous intervals, the very justification which
 I contend for in the Checks, do you not give a <i>Finishing Stroke </i>to
 Calvinistic consistency, when you say, (p. 18,) "I am determined to 
prove my former assertion against you, viz., that you cannot find one 
Protestant divine among the Puritans, &amp;c, till the reign of Charles 
II, who held your doctrines!" You mean those of a sinner's justification
 by faith, and of a saint's justification by works, according to Gal. 
ii, 16, and Matt. xii, 37. Is it not granted on all sides that they all 
held the former justification? And do you not tell the world, No 
Calvinist that you ever heard of denied the latter? However, while you 
thus candidly confess that all Protestant divines held those capital 
doctrines of the Checks, I should not do you justice if I did not 
acknowledge that few, if any of them, held them uniformly and 
consistently in England, till Baxter began to make a firm stand against 
"Antinomian dotages."  
</p><p>Sec. ix, p. 20. You produce these words of mine, 
taken from the Fourth Check, "Your imputation stands upon a preposterous
 supposition that Christ the righteous was an execrable sinner." To this
 you reply with the warmth of a gentleman, who has learned politeness in
 mystic Geneva: "I tell you, Rev, sir, with the bluntness and honesty of
 an Englishman, that this is execrable Swiss slander." Now, sir, that 
what you call "execrable Swiss slander," is <i>sterling English truth,</i>
 I prove by these quotations from your favourite divine, Dr. Crisp, who,
 as quoted by D. Williams, says, (p. 328:) "God makes Christ as very a 
sinner as the creature himself was." Again, (p. 270:) "Nor are we so 
completely sinful, but Christ, being made sin, was as completely sinful 
as we." And it is well known that Luther, in one of his unguarded 
moments, called Christ the greatest, and consequently the most execrable
 sinner in the world. Now, sir, if "Christ was as completely sinful as 
we," (to use the words of your oracle,) does it not follow that he was a
 sinner as completely execrable as we are? And that you deviate a little
 from brotherly kindness when you call Dr. Crisp's Calvinistic mistake 
an execrable slander of mine?  
</p><p>Sec. x, pp. 21, 22. You find fault with my saying,
 "Is this (Christ's praying for Peter) a proof that he never prayed for 
Judas?" And you declare that this "assertion" (you should have said <i>query) "</i>does little honour to the advocacy of Christ." Permit me, sir, to explain myself. Though I believe, with Bishop Latimer, that <i>Christ shed as much blood for Judas as for Peter,</i>
 I never said nor believed, as you insinuate, "that Christ took more 
pains for the salvation of Judas than for that of Peter." You cannot 
justly infer it from my mentioning a matter of fact recorded in 
Scripture, viz., that once our Lord spoke to Judas, when he only looked 
at Peter; for he had explicitly warned Peter before. Therefore, in 
either case, Christ showed himself void (not of a peculiar regard for 
Peter's peculiar sincerity, but) of Calvinistic partiality. Again: I am 
persuaded that during the day of Judas' visitation, Christ prayed for 
him, and sincerely too; for if Christ had borne him a grudge, and, in 
consequence of it, had always made mental reserves, and excepted him 
when he prayed for his apostles; would he not have broken the second 
table of the law? And might he not be proposed as a pattern of 
inveterate malice, rather than of perfect charity?  
</p><p>You reply, (p. 22,) "If this were the case, [i.e. 
if our Lord prayed for Judas,] those words of his, 'I know thou hearest 
me always,' must be untrue; for when he prayed for Judas his prayer was 
rejected." But is your inference just? Christ always prayed with Divine 
wisdom, and according to his Father's will. Therefore he prayed 
consistently with the eternal decree, that moral agents shall be 
invited, drawn, and gently moved, but not forced, to obey the Gospel. 
Now, if our Lord prayed conditionally for Judas, (as he certainly did 
for all his murderers, since they were not all forgiven,) he might say, 
"I know thou hearest me always;" and yet Judas might, by his 
perverseness, as a free agent, "reject against himself" the gracious 
counsel of God, till he was absolutely given up. Thus our scheme of 
doctrine, instead of dishonouring Christ's advocacy, represents it in a 
rational and Scriptural light; while yours, I fear, wounds his character
 in the tenderest part, and fixes upon him the blot of cunning 
uncharitableness, and profound dissimulation.  
</p><p>Sec. xi, p. 25. You say, "Time would fail me to 
pretend to enumerate the many gross misrepresentations," &amp;c. 
However, as you have actually represented me as saying, that the more a 
believer sins upon earth, the merrier he will be in heaven, I beg you 
will point out to me where, in the plain, easy sense of my words, I have
 spoken any such thing; or where I have ever used so ludicrous an 
expression as mirth, &amp;c, when speaking of those "pleasures which are
 at God's right hand for evermore."  
</p><p>I conclude my Antinomian creed thus, <i>(Fourth Check, </i>p.
 261,) "Adultery, incest, and murder, shall, upon the whole, make me 
holier upon earth and merrier in heaven." Two lines below, I observe 
that "I am indebted to you for all the doctrines, and most of the 
expressions of this creed." You have therefore no right to say, "Where 
have I used the expression merry?" For I never said you have used it, 
though our Lord has, Luke xv, 32. But as you have a right to say, Where 
is the doctrine? I reply, In your fourth letter, sir, where you tell us,
 that "a grievous fall will make believers sing louder in heaven to all 
eternity." Now as louder songs are a certain indication of greater joy, 
where nothing is done in hypocrisy, I desire even Calvinists to say if I
 have wrested "the plain, easy sense of your words," in observing that, 
according to your scheme, apostates shall be merrier, Or, if you please,
 more joyful in heaven for their grievous falls on earth.  
</p><p>Page 27. "Now, sir, give me leave to pluck a 
feather out of your high soaring wings, &amp;c, by asking you simply, 
"whence have you taken it? [this quotation so called.] Did I ever assert
 any thing like this? &amp;c. Prove your point, and then I will confess 
that you are no calumniator of God's people." I answer,  
</p><p>(1.) I did not produce as a quotation the words 
which you allude to: I put them in commas, as expressive of the 
sentiments of "many good men." How then could you think that you alone 
are many good men? (2.) But you say that you, for one, understand the 
words of St. John, "He that does righteousness is righteous," of 
personal holiness. Now, sir, to prove me a "calumniator," you have only 
to prove that David did righteousness, when he defiled Uriah's wife; for
 you teach us directly, or indirectly, that when he committed that crime
 he was "undefiled," and continued to be "a man after God's own heart," 
i.e. a righteous man, for "the Lord alloweth the righteous, but the 
ungodly does his soul abhor." (3.) However, if I have mistaken one of 
the scriptures, on which you found your doctrine, I have not mistaken 
the doctrine itself. What are the words for which you call me a 
"calumniator," and charge me with "horrid perversion, falsehood, and 
base disingenuity?" Why, I have represented "many good men" as saying, 
(by the general tenor of one of their doctrines of grace, the absolute 
perseverance of fallen, adulterous, idolatrous, incestuous believers,) 
"Let not Mr. Wesley deceive you: he that actually liveth with another 
man's wife, worships abominable idols, and commits incest with his 
father's wife, may not only be righteous, but complete in imputed 
righteousness," &amp;c. This is the doctrine I charge upon many good 
men. and if you, for one, say, "Did I ever assert any thing like this?" I
 reply, Yes, sir, in your fourth letter, which is a professed attempt to
 prove that believers may, like adulterous David, idolatrous Solomon, 
and the incestuous Corinthian, go any length in sin without ceasing to 
stand complete in, what I beg leave to call, Calvinistic righteousness. 
Thus, instead of "plucking a feather out of my wings," you wing the 
arrow which I let fly at your great Diana. [Proofreader's note: 
'Fletcher' means 'one who puts feathers -- fletching -- on arrows'!] 
</p><p>Sec. xii. For brevity's sake I shall reduce my 
answer to the rest of your capital charges into plain queries, not 
doubting but my judicious readers will see their unreasonableness 
without the help of arguments.  
</p><p>1. Is it right in Mr. Hill to call (pp. 34, 35) my
 extract from Flavel "a citation," and "a quotation;" and then to charge
 me with "disingenuity, gross perversion, expunging," &amp;c, because I 
have not swelled my extract by transcribing all Flavel's book, or 
because I have taken only what suits the present times, and what is 
altogether consistent? Especially when I have observed, <i>(Fourth Check, </i>p.
 234,) "that, when Flavel encounters Antinomian errors as a disciple of 
Calvin, his hands hang down, Amalek prevails; and a shrewd logician 
could, without any magical power, force him to confess, that most of the
 errors which he so justly opposes are the natural consequences of 
Calvinism?"  
</p><p>2. Is it right in Mr. Hill to charge me (p. 57) 
with "base forgeries;" and to represent me (p. 56) as "descending to the
 poor, illiberal arts of forgery, and defamation," because I have 
presented the public with a parable in the dress of a royal 
proclamation, which I produce as a mere "illustration;" because I charge
 him with indirectly propagating tenets which as necessarily flow from 
his doctrines of grace, as light does from the sun; and because I have 
distinguished by commas a creed framed with his avowed principles? 
Although I have added these words, to show that I took the composition 
of it upon myself: "You speak indeed in the third person, and I in the 
first; but this alters not the doctrine. Some clauses and sentences I 
have added, not to misrepresent and blacken, (for what need is there of 
blackening the sable mantle of midnight?) but to introduce, connect, and
 illustrate your sentiments."  
</p><p>3. Angry as the Pharisees were at our Lord when he
 exposed their errors by parables, did they ever charge him with base 
forgery, because his "illustrations" were not true stories? Is it not 
strange that this admirable way of defending "the truth" should have 
been found out by the grand defender of "the doctrines of grace?" Again:
 if marking with commas a paragraph of our composing, to distinguish it 
from our own real sentiments, is a crime; is not Mr. Hill as criminal as
 myself? Does he not (p. 31,) present the public with a card of his own 
composing, in which he holds forth the supposed sentiments of many 
clergymen, and which he distinguishes with commas thus: "The Feather's 
Tavern fraternity present compliments to Messrs J. Wesley and Fletcher,"
 &amp;c. Shall what passes for wit in the author of <i>Pietas Oxoniensis, </i>be
 gross disingenuity, and base forgery, in the author of the Vindication?
 O ye candid Calvinists, partial as your system is, can you possibly 
approve of such glaring partiality?  
</p><p>4. Is it right of Mr. Hill to take his leave of me
 in this abrupt manner, (pp. 39, 40:) "The unfair quotations you have 
made, and the shocking misrepresentations and calumnies you have been 
guilty of, will for the future prevent me from looking into any of your 
books, <i>if </i>you should write a thousand volumes:" and this 
especially under pretence, that I have "shamefully perverted and 
misrepresented the doctrines of Anthony Burgess," when I have simply 
produced a quotation from him, in which there is not a shadow of 
misrepresentation, as the reader will see by comparing Fourth Check, (p.
 226,) with the last paragraph of the twelfth Sermon of Mr. Burgess on <i>Grace and Assurance?</i>  
</p><p>Sec. xiii. This perpetual noise about "gross 
misrepresentations, shameful perversions, interpolations, base 
forgeries," &amp;c, becomes Mr. Hill as little as any man; his own 
inaccuracy in quotation equalling that of the most inattentive writer I 
am acquainted with. Our readers have seen on what a slender basis he 
rests his charge of "base forgeries." I beg leave to show them how on 
what solid ground I rest my charge of uncommon inaccuracy; and not to 
intrude too long upon their patience, I shall just produce a few 
instances only out of his <i>Finishing Stroke.*</i>  
</p><p>[ * To produce such instances out of the "Review,"
 would be almost endless. One, however, Mr. Hill forces me to touch upon
 a second time. This is the case. The sword of the Spirit, which Mr. 
Wesley uses, is two edged. When he defends the first Gospel axiom 
against the Pharisees, he preached "salvation, not by the merit of 
works, but by believing in Christ:" and when he defends the second 
Gospel axiom against the Antinomians, he preaches "salvation, not by the
 merit of works, but by works as a condition." No sooner did the 
Calvinists see this last proposition at full length in the Minutes than 
they took the alarm, fondly imagining that Mr. Wesley wanted to 
overthrow the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith. To convince 
them of their mistake, I appealed to Mr. Wesley's works in general, and 
to the Minutes in particular; two sentences of which evidently show that
 he had not the least intention of setting aside faith in Christ, in 
order to make way for the antichristian merit of works. Accordingly, I 
laid those sentences before my readers, taking special care to show by 
commas that I produced two different parts of the Minutes, thus: "Not by
 the merit of works," but by "believing in Christ." Here is not a shadow
 of disingenuity, either as to the quotations, for they are fairly taken
 from the Minutes; or as to the sense of the whole sentences, for many 
volumes, and myriads of hearers can testify, that it perfectly agrees 
with Mr. Wesley's well-known doctrine. But what does Mr. Hill? Biased by
 his system, he tampers with my quotations; he takes off the two commas 
after the word works; he overlooks the two commas before the word 
believing! He (inadvertently, I hope) throws my two distinct quotations 
into one; and by that means adds to them the words "but by," which I had
 particularly excluded. When he has thus turned my two just quotations 
into one that is false, he is pleased to put me into the Geneva pillory 
for his own mistake; and as his doctrines of grace teach him to kill two
 birds with one stone, he involves Mr. Wesley in my gratuitous disgrace,
 thus: "Forgeries of this kind have long passed for no crime with Mr. 
Wesley: I did not think you would have followed him in these ungenerous 
articles." ("Review," p. 27.) Upon the remonstrance I made about this 
strange way of proceeding, (see note, Fourth Check, p. 229,) I hoped 
that Mr. Hill would have hanged down his head a moment, and dropped the 
point for ever. But no: he must give a Finishing Stroke, and drive home 
the nail of his rash accusation, by calling my remarks upon his mistakes
 "attempts to vindicate that most shameful, false quotation he [Mr. 
Fletcher] has twice made from the Minutes." (Log. Wesl. p. 35.) And to 
prove that my attempts have been unsuccessful, he produces passages out 
of a newspaper, which represent "his majesty,""stealing bread," "her 
majesty,""committed to the house of correction." To this I answer, that
 if such unconnected quotations (of which I only give here the 
substance) were properly distinguished by commas; if they were separated
 by intervening words; and, if they did not in the least misrepresent 
the author's sense, it would be great injustice to call them either "a 
most shameful false quotation," or a "forgery." Now these three 
particulars meet in my two quotations from the Minutes. (1.) They are 
both properly distinguished with commas. (2.) They are parted by 
intervening words. And (3.) They do not in the least misrepresent Mr. 
Wesley's meaning: whereas, (to say nothing more of my commas expunged in
 the Review,) no word intervenes between Mr. Hill's supposed quotations 
out of the papers; and they form a shameful misrepresentation of the 
publisher's meaning.  
</p><p>O but as the quotations from the Minutes are 
linked, they "speak a language directly opposite to the Minutes 
themselves." So says Mr. Hill, without producing the shadow of a proof. 
But, upon the arguments of the five Checks, I affirm that the two Gospel
 axioms, or my linked quotations and the Minutes, agree as perfectly 
with each other as those positions of St. Paul to which they answer: "By
 grace ye are saved through faith." Therefore "work out your salvation 
with fear."  
</p><p>From this redoubled stroke of Mr. Hill, I am 
tempted to think, that, like Justice, "Logica Genevensis" has a covering
 over her eyes; but, alas! for a very different reason. Like her also 
she has a balance in her left hand; but it is to weigh out and vend her 
own assertions as proofs. And, like her, she holds a sword in her right 
hand; but, alas! it is often to wound brotherly love, and stab 
evangelical truth. Bring her into the field of controversy, and she will
 at once cut down Christ's doctrine as dreadful heresy. Set her in the 
judgment seat to pass sentence over good works, and over honest men, 
that do not bow at her shrine; and without demur she will pronounce, 
that the former are dung, and that the latter are knaves.]  
</p><p>1<i>. </i>That performance does not do my sermon, 
justice; for, (P. 51,) Mr. Hill quotes me so: "They [good works] are 
declarative of our free justification;" whereas my manuscript runs thus:
 "They are the declarative cause of our free justification," viz., in 
the day of trial and of judgment. The word "cause" here is of the utmost
 importance to my doctrine, powerfully guarding the Minutes and 
undefiled religion. Whether <i>it </i>is left out, because it shows at 
once the absurdity of pretending that my old sermon "is the best 
confutation of Mr. Wesley's Minutes," or because Mr. Hill's copier 
omitted it first, is best known to Mr. Hill himself.  
</p><p>2. I say in the Fourth Check, (p. 293,) "To 
vindicate what I beg leave to call God's honesty, permit me to observe, 
first, that I had rather believe Joseph told once 'a gross untruth,' 
than to suppose that God perpetually equivocates." For undoubtedly of 
two evils I would choose the least, if a cogent dilemma obliged me to 
choose either. But this is not the case here: the dilemma is not 
forcible; for in the next lines I show that Joseph, instead of "telling a
 gross untruth," only spake the language of brotherly kindness. However,
 without paying any regard to my vindication of Joseph's speech, Mr. 
Hill catches at the conditional words, "I had rather believe:" just as 
if I had said, I do actually believe, he turns them into a peremptory 
declaration of my faith, and three times represents me as asserting what
 I never said nor believed. Thus, (p. 38,) "your wonderful assertion, 
that Joseph told his brethren a gross untruth." Once more, (p 39,) "The 
repeated words of inspiration you venture to call gross untruth." 
Solomon says, "Who can stand before envy?" And I ask, "Who can stand 
before Mr. Hill's inattention?" I am sure, neither I, nor Mr. Wesley. At
 this rate he can undoubtedly find a blasphemy in every page, and a 
farrago in every book.  
</p><p>3. Take another instance of the same, want of 
exactness. I say in the Fourth Check, (p. 222,) "I never thought Mr. 
Whitefield was clear in the doctrine of our Lord: 'In the day of 
judgment by thy words shalt thou be justified;' for if he had seen it in
 a proper light, he would instantly have renounced Calvinism." This 
passage Mr. Hill quotes thus, in italics and commas, (p. 23:<i>) </i>" <i>You never thought him clear in our Lord's doctrine; for if he had, he would have renounced his Calvinism." </i>The
 inaccuracy of this quotation consists in omitting those important words
 of our Lord: "In the day of judgment," &amp;c. By this omission that 
sense of the preceding clause is indefinite; and I am represented as 
saying, that Mr. Whitefield is not clear in any doctrine of our Lord, no
 not in that of the fall, repentance, salvation by faith, the new birth,
 &amp;c. This one mistake of Mr. Hill is sufficient to make me pass for a
 mere coxcomb in all the Calvinistic world.  
</p><p>4. It is by the like inattention that Mr. Hill 
prejudices also against me the friends of Mr. Wesley. In the Fourth 
Check, after having answered an objection of the Rev. Mr. Hill against 
Mr. Wesley, I produce that objection again for a fuller answer, and say:
 "But, supposing that Mr. Wesley had not properly considered, &amp;c, 
what would you infer from thence? &amp;c. Weigh your argument, &amp;c, 
and you will find it is wanting." Then I immediately produce Mr. Hill's 
objection in the form of an argument, thus: "Twenty-three, or, if you 
please, three years ago, Mr. Wesley wanted clearer light," &amp;c. Now 
what I evidently produce as a supposition, and as the Rev. Mr. Hill's 
own argument unfolded in order to answer it, my opponent fathers upon me
 thus:" The following are your own words, "<i>Three years ago Mr. Wesley wanted clearer light." &amp;c. </i>True,
 they are my own words: but, to do me justice, Mr. Hill should have 
produced them as I do, namely, as a supposition, and as the drift of his
 brother's objection, in order to show its frivolousness. This is partly
 such a mistake as if Mr. Hill said: "The following are David's own 
words, '<i>Tussah! there is no God.'"</i>  
</p><p>However, he is determined to improve his own 
oversight, and he does it by asking, (p. 17,) "What then is become of 
thousands of Mr. Wesley's followers who died before this clearer light 
came?" An argument this by which the most ignorant Papists in my parish 
perpetually defend their idolatrous superstitions: "What is become of 
all our forefathers," say they, "before Luther and Calvin? Were they all
 damned?" Is it not surprising that Mr. Hill, not contented to produce a
 Popish friar's conversation, should have thus recourse to the argument 
of every Popish cobbler who attacks the doctrine of the reformation? <i>O Logica Genevensis! </i>how dost thou show thyself the genuine sister of <i>Logica Romana!</i>  
</p><p>5. I return to the mistakes by which Mr. Hill has 
supported, before the world, his charge of "calumny." I say, in the 
Second Check, (p. 109.) "How few of our celebrated pulpits are there 
where more has not been said <i>at times </i>for sin than against it?" 
Mr. Hill (p. 7) says, "The ministers, who preach in these (our most 
celebrated pulpits,) are condemned <i>without exception, </i>as such <i>pleaders for sin, </i>that <i>they say more for it than against it." </i>Here
 are two capital mistakes, (1.) The question, How few? &amp;c, evidently
 leaves room for some exceptions; but Mr. Hill represents me as 
condemning our most celebrated pulpits "without exception." (2.) This is
 not all. To mitigate the question, I add, "at times," words by which I 
give my readers to understand that sin is in general attacked in our 
celebrated pulpits, and that it is only at times, that is, on some 
particular occasion, or in some part of a sermon, that the ministers 
alluded to say more for sin than against it. Now, Mr. Hill leaves out of
 his quotation the words, at times, and by that means effectually 
represents me as "a calumniator of God's people: for what is true with 
the limitation that I use, becomes a falsehood when it is produced 
without. This omission of Mr. Hill is the more singular, as my putting 
the words, <i>at times, </i>in italics, indicates that I want my readers
 to lay a peculiar stress upon it on account of its importance. One more
 instance of Mr. Hill's inaccuracy, and I have done.  
</p><p>6. Pages 7, 8. He presents his readers with a long
 paragraph produced as a quotation from the Second Check. It is made up 
of some detached sentences picked here and there from that piece, and 
put together with as much wisdom as the patches which make up a fool's 
coat. And among these sentences he has introduced this, which is not 
mine in sense any more than in expression: "They [celebrated ministers] 
handle no texts of Scripture without distorting them," for I insinuate 
just the contrary, in the Second Check.  
</p><p>7. But the greatest fault I find with that 
paragraph of Mr. Hill's book is the conclusion, which runs thus: "They 
[celebrated ministers] do the devil's work till they and their 
congregations all go to hell together. Second Check, pp. 97, 103." Now, 
in neither of the pages quoted by Mr. Hill, nor indeed any where else, 
did I ever say so wild and wicked a thing. Nothing could engage my pious
 opponent to father such a horrid assertion upon me, but the great and 
severe Diana, that engages him to father absolute reprobation upon God. 
 
</p><p>It is true, however, that, alluding to the words 
of our Lord, Matt. i, I say, in the Second Check, p. 129, "If these 
shall go into everlasting punishment," &amp;c. But who are these? <i>well celebrated ministers, with all their congregations! </i>So
 says Mr. Hill; but, happily for me, my heart starts from the thought 
with the greatest detestation, and my pen has testified that these 
condemned wretches are in general "obstinate workers of iniquity," and, 
in particular, "unrenewed antiCalvinists, and impenitent Nicolaitans." 
Page 126, (the very page which Mr. Hill quotes,) I describe the 
unrenewed anti-Calvinists thus: "Stubborn Sons of Belial, saying, Lord, 
thy Father is merciful; and if thou didst die for all, why not for us? 
Obstinate Pharisees, who plead the good they did in their own name to 
supersede the Redeemer's merits." Impenitent Nicolaitans or Antinomians,
 I describe thus, (pp. 129, 136, 137: "Obstinate violators of God's law,
 who scorned personal holiness; rejected Christ's word of command; have 
gone on still in their wickedness; have continued in doing evil; have 
been unfaithful unto death; and have defiled their garments to the 
last." Is it possible that Mr. Hill should take this for a description 
of <i>all </i>celebrated ministers, and of all their congregations, and 
that, upon so glaring a mistake, he should represent me as making them 
"all go to hell together?"  
</p><p>Sec. xiv. O ye pious Calvinists, whether ye fill 
our celebrated pulpits, or attend upon them that do, far from sending 
"you all to hell together," as you are told I do, I exult in the hope of
 meeting you <i>all together in heaven. </i>I lie not. I speak the truth
 in Him that shall justify us by our words; even now I enjoy a foretaste
 of heaven in lying at your feet in spirit; and my conscience bears me 
witness, that, though I try to detect and oppose your mistakes, I 
sincerely love and honour your persons. My regard for you, as zealous, 
defenders of the first Gospel axiom, is unalterable. Though your 
mistaken zeal should prompt you to think or say all manner of evil 
against me, because I help Mr. Wesley to defend the second; am 
determined to offer you still the right band of fellowship. And if any 
of you should honour me so far as to accept it, I shall think myself 
peculiarly happy; for, next to Jesus and truth, the esteem and love of 
good men is what I consider as the most invaluable blessing. A desire to
 recover the interest I once had in the brotherly kindness of some of 
you, has in part engaged me to clear myself from the mistaken charges of
 calumny and forgery, by which my hasty opponent has prejudiced you 
against me and my Checks. If you find that he has defended your cause 
with carnal weapons, hope with me that precipitation, and too warm a 
zeal for your doctrines have misled him, and not malice or disingenuity.
  
</p><p>Hope it also, ye anti-Calvinists, considering that
 if St. James and St. John, through mere bigotry and impatience of 
opposition, were once ready to command fire from heaven to come down 
upon the Samaritans, it is no wonder that Mr. Hill, in an unguarded 
moment, should have commanded the fire of his Calvinistic zeal to kindle
 against Mr. Wesley and me. As you do not unchristian now the two rash 
apostles for a sin, of which they immediately repented, let me beseech 
you to confirm your love toward Mr. Hill, who has probably repented 
already of the mistakes into which his peculiar sentiments have betrayed
 his good nature and good breeding.  
</p><p>Sec. xv. I return to you, honoured sir, and beg 
you would forgive me the liberty I have taken to lay before the public 
what I should have been glad to have buried in eternal oblivion. But 
your <i>Finishing Stroke </i>has been so heavy and desperate, as to make this addition to <i>Logica Genevensis </i>necessary
 to clear up my doctrine, to vindicate my honesty, to point out the 
mistaken author of the Farrago, and give the world a new specimen of the
 arguments by which your system must be defended, when reason, 
conscience, and Scripture, (the three most formidable batteries in the 
world,) begin to play upon its ramparts.  
</p><p>You "earnestly entreat" me, in your <i>postscript, </i>to
 publish a manuscript sermon on Rom. xi, 5, 6, that I preached about 
eleven years ago in my Church, in defence of the first Gospel axiom. You
 are pleased to call it three times "excellent," and you present the 
public with an extract from it, made up of some unguarded passages; 
detached from those that in a great degree guard them, explain my 
meaning, confirm the doctrine of the Checks, and sap the foundation of 
your mistakes. As I am not less willing to defend free grace, than to 
plead for faithful obedience, I shall gladly grant your request, so far 
at least as to send my old sermon into the world with additions in 
brackets, just as I preached it again last spring; assuring you that the
 greatest addition is in favour of free grace. By thus complying with 
your "earnest entreaty," I shall show my respect, meet you halfway, 
gratify the curiosity of our readers, and yet give them a specimen of 
what appears to me a free guarded Gospel.  
</p><p>That discourse will be the principal piece of <i>An Equal Check to Pharisaism and Antinomianism </i>which
 I have prepared for the press. Upon the plan of the doctrines it 
contains, I do not despair to see moderate Calvinists, and unprejudiced 
anti-Calvinists acknowledge their mutual orthodoxy, and embrace one 
another with mutual forbearance. May you and I, dear sir, set them the 
example! In the meantime, may the brotherly love, with which we forgive 
each other the real or apparent unkindness of our publications, continue
 and increase! May the charity that is "not easily provoked," and 
"hopeth all things," uniformly influence our hearts! So shall the words 
that drop from our lips, or distil from our pens, evidence that we are, 
or desire to be, the close followers of the meek, gentle, and yet 
impartial, plain-spoken Lamb of God. For his sake, to whom we are both 
so greatly indebted, restore me to your former benevolence, and be 
persuaded, that notwithstanding the severity of your <i>Finishing Stroke, </i>and
 the plainness of my answer, I really think it an honour, and feel it a 
pleasure to subscribe myself, honoured and dear sir, your affectionate 
and obedient servant, in the Gospel of our common Lord,  
</p><p>J. FLETCHER.

</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>APPENDIX.</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p><i>Upon the remaining difference between true 
Calvinists and the anti-Calvinists with respect to our Lord's doctrine 
of justification by words, and St. James' doctrine of justification by 
works.</i>  
</p><p>To force my dear opponents out of the last 
entrenchment in which they defend their mistakes, and from behind which 
they attack the justification by words and works peculiarly insisted on 
by our Lord and St. James, I only need to show how far we agree with 
respect to that justification; to state the difference that remains 
between us; and to prove the unreasonableness of considering us as 
Papists, because we oppose an unscriptural and irrational distinction, 
that leaves Mr. Fulsome in full possession of all his Antinomian 
dotages.  
</p><p>On both sides we agree to maintain, in opposition 
to Socinians and Deists, that the grand, the primary, and properly 
meritorious cause of our justification, from first to last, both in the 
day of conversion and in the day of judgment, is only the precious 
atonement, and the infinite merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. We all 
agree, likewise, that, in the day of conversion, faith is the 
instrumental cause of our justification before God. Nay, if I mistake 
not, we come one step nearer each other, for we equally hold that after 
conversion the works of faith are in this world, and will be in the day 
of judgment, the evidencing cause of our justification; that is, the 
works of faith (under the above-mentioned primary cause of our 
salvation, and in subordination to the faith that gives them birth) are 
now, and will be in the great day, the evidence that shall 
instrumentally cause our justification as believers. Thus Mr. Hill says,
 <i>(Review, </i>p. 149:<i>) </i>" Neither Mr. Shirley, nor I, nor any 
Calvinist that I ever heard of, denies, that though a sinner be 
justified in the sight of God by Christ alone, he is declaratively 
justified by works, both here and at the day of judgment." And the Rev. 
Mr. Madan, in his sermon on <i>justification by works, by, stated, explained, and reconciled with justification by faith, &amp;c, </i>says,
 (p. 29,) "By Christ only are we meritoriously justified, and by faith 
only are we instrumentally justified in the sight of God; but by works, 
and not by faith only, are we declaratively justified before men and 
angels." From these two quotations, which could easily be multiplied to 
twenty, it is evident, that pious Calvinists hold the doctrine of a 
justification by the works of faith; or, as Mr. Madan expresses it, 
after St. James, "by works, and not by faith only."  
</p><p>It remains now to show wherein we disagree. At 
first sight the difference seems trifling, but upon close examination it
 appears that the whole Antinomian gulf still remains fixed between us. 
Read over the preceding quotations; weigh the clauses which I have put 
in italics; compare them with what the Rev. Mr. Berridge says in his 
"Christian World Unmasked," (p. 26,) of "an absolute impossibility of 
being justified in any manner by our works," namely, before God; and you
 will see that although pious Calvinists allow we are justified by works
 before men and angels, yet they deny our being ever justified by works 
before God, in whose sight they suppose we are for ever "justified by 
Christ alone," i.e. only by Christ's good works and sufferings 
absolutely imputed to us, from the very first moment in which we make a 
single act of true faith, if not from all eternity. Thus works are still
 entirely excluded from having any hand either in our intermediate or 
eternal justification before God, and thus they are still represented as
 totally needless to our eternal salvation. Now, in direct opposition to
 the above-mentioned distinction, we anti-Calvinists believe that adult 
persons cannot be saved without being justified by faith as sinners, 
according to the light of their dispensation; and by works as believers,
 according to the time and opportunities they have of working. We assert
 that the works of faith are not less necessary to our justification 
before God as believers, than faith itself is necessary to our 
justification before him as sinners: and we maintain, that when faith 
does not produce good works, (much more when it produces the worst 
works, such as adultery, hypocrisy, treachery, murder, &amp;c,) it dies,
 and justifies no more, seeing it is a living and not a dead faith that 
justifies us as sinners; even as they are living, and not dead works 
that justify us as believers. I have already exposed the absurdity of 
the doctrine, that works are necessary to our final justification before
 men and angels, but not before God. However, as this distinction is one
 of the grand subterfuges of the decent Antinomians, and one of the 
pleas by which the hearts of the simple are most easily deceived into 
Solifidianism, to the many arguments that I have already produced upon 
this head in the sixth letter of the Fourth Check, I beg leave to add 
those which follow:  
</p><p>1. The way of making up the Antinomian gap, by 
saying, that works are necessary to our intermediate and final 
justification before men and angels, but not before God, is as bad as 
the gap itself. "If God is for me (says judicious Mr. Fulsome) who can 
be against me? If God has for ever justified me only by Christ, and if 
works have absolutely no place in my justification before him, what care
 I for men and angels? Should they justify when God condemns, what would
 their absolution avail? And if they condemn when God justifies, what 
signifies their condemnation? All creatures are fallible. The myriads of
 men and angels are as nothing before God. He is all in all." Thus, Mr. 
Fulsome, by a most judicious way of arguing, keeps the field of 
licentiousness where the Solifidian ministers have inadvertently brought
 him, and whence he is too wise to depart upon their brandishing before 
him the broken reed of an absurd distinction.  
</p><p>2. Our justification by works will principally, 
and in some cases entirely, turn upon the works of the heart, which are 
unknown to all but God. Again: were men and angels in all cases to pass a
 decisive sentence upon us according to our works, they might judge us 
severely, as Mr. Hill judges Mr. Wesley: they might brand us for forgery
 upon the most frivolous appearances; at least they might condemn us as 
rashly as Job's friends condemned him. Once more: were our fellow 
creatures to condemn us decisively by our works, they would often do it 
as unjustly as the disciples condemned the blessed woman, who poured a 
box of very precious ointment on our Lord's head. They had indignation, 
and blamed as uncharitable waste what our Lord was pleased to call "a 
good work wrought upon him," a good work, which shall be told for a 
memorial of her as long as the Christian Gospel is preached. To this may
 be added the mistake of the apostles, who, even after they had received
 the Holy Ghost, condemned Saul of Tarsus by his former, when they 
should have absolved him by his latter works. And even now, how few 
believers would justify Phinehas for running Zimri and Cosbi through the
 body, or Peter for striking Ananias and Sapphira dead, without giving 
them time to say once, "Lord, have mercy upon us!" Nay, how many would 
condemn them as rash men, if not as cruel murderers! In some cases, 
therefore, none can possibly justify or condemn believers by their 
works, but He who is perfectly acquainted with all the outward 
circumstances of their actions, and with all the secret springs whence 
they flow.  
</p><p>3. The Scriptures know nothing of the distinction 
which I explode. When St. Paul denies that Abraham was justified by 
works, it is only when he treats of the justification of a sinner, and 
speaks of the "works of unbelief." When Christ says, "By thy words thou 
shalt be justified," he makes no mention of angels. To suppose that they
 shall be able to justify a world of men by their words, is to suppose 
that they have heard, and do remember, all the words of all mankind, 
which is supposing them to be gods. Nay, far from being judged by 
angels, St. Paul says, that "we shall judge them;" not indeed as proper 
judges, but as Christ's assessors and mystical members: for our Lord, in
 his description of the great day, informs us that he, and not men or 
angels, will justify the sheep, and condemn the goats, by their works.  
</p><p>4. St. Paul discountenances the evasive 
distinction which I oppose when he says, "Thinkest thou, O man, who 
doest such things, that thou shalt escape the righteous judgment of God,
 who will render eternal life to them that by patient continuance in 
well doing seek for glory, &amp;c, when he shall judge the secrets of 
men by Jesus Christ?" For reason dictates, that neither men nor angels, 
but the Searcher of hearts alone will be able to justify or condemn us 
by secrets, unknown possibly to all but himself.  
</p><p>5. If you say, Most men shall have been condemned 
or justified long before the day of judgment; therefore the solemn pomp 
of that day will be appointed merely for the sake of justification by 
men and angels: I exclaim against the unreasonableness of supposing that
 "the great and terrible day of God," with an eye to which the world of 
rationals was created, is to be only the day of men and angels. And I 
reply: Although I grant, that judgment certainly finds us where death 
leaves us; final justification and condemnation being chiefly a solemn 
seal set, if I may so speak, upon the forehead of those whose 
consciences are already justified or condemned, according to the last 
turn of their trial on earth: yet it appears, both from Scripture and 
reason, that mankind cannot properly be judged before the great day. 
Departed spirits are not men; and dead men cannot be tried till the 
resurrection of the dead takes place, when departed spirits and raised 
bodies will form men again by their re-union. Therefore, in the very 
nature of things, God cannot judge mankind before the great day; and to 
suppose that the Father has appointed such a day, that we may be finally
 justified by our works before men and angels, and not before him, is to
 suppose that he has committed the chief judgment to the parties to be 
judged, i.e. to men and angels, and not to Jesus Christ.  
</p><p>6. But, if I mistake not, St. James puts the 
matter out of all dispute, where he says: "You see, then, that by works a
 man is justified, and not by faith only," chap. ii, 24<i>. </i>This 
shows that a man is justified by works before the same judge, by whom he
 is justified by faith; and here is the proof. Nobody was ever justified
 by faith before men and angels, because faith is an inward act of the 
soul, which none but the Tryer of the reins can be a judge of. 
Therefore, as the Justifier by faith alluded to in the latter part of 
the verse is undoubtedly God alone, it is contrary to all the rules of 
criticism to suppose that the Justifier by works, alluded to in the very
 same sentence, is men and angels. Nay, in the preceding verse, God is 
expressly mentioned, and not men or angels: "Abraham believed God, and 
it was imputed to him for righteousness," i.e. he was justified before 
God. So that the same Lord, who justified him <i>as a sinner by faith </i>in the day of his conversion, justified him also <i>as a believer by works </i>in the day of his trial.  
</p><p>7. But this is not all. Turning to Gen. xxii, the 
chapter which St. James had undoubtedly in view when he insisted upon 
Abraham's justification by works, I find the best of arguments, matter 
of fact. "And it came to pass, that God did tempt [i.e. try] Abraham." 
The patriarch acquitted himself like a sound believer in the hard trial;
 he obediently offered up his favourite son. Here St. James addresses a 
Solifidian, and bluntly says, "Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith 
without works is dead," i.e. that when faith gives over working by 
obedient love, it sickens, dies, and commences a dead faith? Was not 
Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac upon the 
altar? If Mr. Hill answer, Yes, he was justified by works before men and
 angels, but not before God; I reply, Impossible! For neither men nor 
angels put him to the trial to bring out what was in his heart. God 
tried him that he might justly punish, or wisely reward him; therefore 
God justified him. If a judge, after trying a man on a particular 
occasion, acquits him upon his good behaviour, in order to proceed to 
the reward of him, is it not absurd to say, that the man is acquitted 
before the court, but not before the judge; especially if there is 
neither court nor jury present, but only the judge? Was not this the 
case at Abraham's trial? Do we hear of any angel being present but the 
Angel Jehovah? And had not Abraham left his two servants with the ass at
 the foot of the mount? Is it reasonable then to suppose that Abraham 
was justified before them by a work, which as yet they had not heard of;
 for, says St. James, "When [which implies as soon as] he had offered 
Isaac, he was justified by works?" If you say that he was justified 
before Isaac, I urge the absurdity of supposing that God made so much 
ado about the trial of Abraham before the lad; and demand proof that God
 had appointed the youth to be the justifier of his aged parent.  
</p><p>8. But let the sacred historian decide the 
question. "And the Lord called to Abraham out of heaven, and said, Lay 
not thy hand upon the lad, for now I know [declaratively] that thou 
fearest God," (i.e. believest in God.) Now I can praise and reward thee 
with wisdom and equity: "Seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only
 son from me." Upon Calvinistic principles, did not God speak 
improperly? Should not he have said, Now angels and men, before whom 
thou hast offered Isaac, do know that thou fearest me? But if God had 
spoken thus, would he have spoken consistently with either his veracity 
or his wisdom? Is it not far more reasonable to suppose, that although 
God as omniscient, with a glance of his eyes, "tries the hearts, 
searches the reins," and foresees all future contingencies; yet, as a 
judge, and a wise dispenser of punishments and rewards, he condemns no 
unbelievers, and justifies no believers, in St. James' sense, but by the
 evidence of tempers, words, and actions, which actually spring from 
their unbelief, or their faith?  
</p><p>9. Was it not from the same motive that God tried 
Job in the land of Uz, chap. i, 12, Israel in the wilderness, Deut. 
viii, 1, compared with Josh. xxii, 2, and King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, 2 
Chron. xxxii, 31. "God (says the historian) left him [to the temptation]
 that he [God] might know [declaratively] all that was in his heart." It
 is true, Mr. Hill supposes, in the second edition of his Five Letters, 
that the words, <i>he might know, </i>refer to Hezekiah; but Canne more 
judiciously refers to Gen. xxii, 1, where God tried Abrahamnot that 
Abraham might know, but that he himself might declaratively know what 
was in Abraham's heart. If the word <i>that </i>HE <i>might know, </i>did refer to Hezekiah, should not the affix (') <i>he, </i>or <i>him, </i>have been added to [rn-i], thus<i>, </i>as it is put to the two preceding verbs, '<i>he left </i>him', <i>to try </i>HIM!  
</p><p>10. Our Lord himself decides the question, where 
he says to his believing disciples, "Whosoever shall confess me before 
men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But 
whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my 
Father who is in heaven." It was undoubtedly an attention to this 
scripture that made Dr. Owen say: "Hereby [by personal obedience] that 
faith whereby we are justified [as sinners] is evidenced, proved, 
manifested in the sight of God and man." And yet, astonishing! this 
passage, which indirectly gives up the only real difference there is 
between Mr. Hill's justification by works and ours; this passage, which 
cuts him off from the only way he has of making his escape, (except that
 by which his brother tried to make his own, see <i>Fourth Check, </i>p. 279;) this very passage which makes so much for my sentiment, is one of those concerning which he says, <i>(Finishing Stroke, </i>p. 14) "Words <i>prudently </i>expunged by Mr. Fletcher," when they are only words, which for brevity's sake I very <i>imprudently </i>left out, since they cut down Solifidianism, even with Dr. Owen's sword.  
</p><p>To conclude. Attentive reader, peruse James ii, 
where the justification of believers by works before God is so strongly 
insisted upon. Observe what is said there of the law of liberty; of 
believers being judged by that law; of the "judgment without mercy;" 
that shall be shown to fallen, merciless believers according to that 
law. Consider that this doctrine exactly coincides with the sermon upon 
the mount, and the Epistle to the Hebrews; that it perfectly tallies 
with Ezek. xviii, xxxiii; Matt. xii, xxv; Rom. ii; Gal. vi, &amp;c; and 
that it is delivered to brethren, yea, to the beloved brethren of St. 
James, to whom he could say, "Out of his own will the Father of lights 
begat us with the word of truth." Take notice that the charge indirectly
 brought against them is that they "had the faith of the Lord Jesus 
Christ with respect of persons;" and that they <i>" </i>deceived their 
own selves," by not being as careful doers as they were diligent 
"hearers of the word." Then look round upon some of our most famous 
believers: see how foaming, how roaring, how terrible are the billows of
 their partiality. Read "An A<i>ddress from candid Protestants to the Rev. Mr. Fletcher;" </i>read <i>"The Finishing Stroke;" </i>read <i>"More Work for </i>Mr. <i>Wesley;</i>" read the <i>Checks to Arminianism; </i>and
 say if there is not as great need to insist upon a believer's 
justification by words and works as there was in the days of our Lord 
and St. James: and if it is not high time to say to modern believers, 
"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect 
of persons. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the 
law of liberty. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath 
showed no mercy: for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; 
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again, [by 
Him that] shall render to every one according to what he has done in the
 body, whether it be good or bad." But "candid Protestants" have an 
answer ready in their "Address." This is "the Popish doctrine of 
justification by works," and "Arminian Methodism turned out rank Popery 
at last." This is a mingle mangle of "the most high and mighty, self. 
righteous, self-potent, self-important, self-sanctifying, 
self-justifying, and self-exalting medley minister."* The misfortune is,
 that amidst these witticisms of <i>" </i>the Protestants," (for it 
seems the Calvinists engross that name to themselves,) we, "rank 
Papists," still look out for arguments; and when we find none, or only 
such as are worse than none, we still say <i>Logica Genevensis! </i>and 
remain confirmed in our "dreadful heresy," or rather in our Lord's 
anti-Calvinistic doctrine, "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
 thy words thou shalt be condemned."
