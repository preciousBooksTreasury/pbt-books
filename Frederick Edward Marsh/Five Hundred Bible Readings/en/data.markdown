# Preface

I HAVE been repeatedly asked to publish a book of my Bible Readings, and
at last I am encouraged to do so, by the many kind words which I have
received from all parts of the world, especially from missionaries, who
are isolated from the stimulus of Christian fellowship, and who have
been helped by what I have previously written.

To whose workers for, and with Christ, who have asked me to print some
of my Bible Readings, and those who have been helped in the past, I
gladly dedicate this volume-praying that the odour of God’s precious
Word found in these studies may fill the house of the being of His
servants to their help and happiness, and thus rise as a sweet savour to
our Lord.

It will be noted that I have not followed any method of uniformity in
the Bible Readings. Some are mere outlines. Others are worked out.

# Introductory Note

By Dr. James H. Brookes

THE best commentary on the Bible is the Bible. Important help may be
received from devout scholarship in the accurate translation of Hebrew
and Greek words, when the student is not familiar with the original
languages in which the Scriptures were written; but beyond that, men can
give very little assistance in the elucidation of the text.

The Bible is a plain Book, intended for a plain people. Hence the
Westminster Assembly of Divines, 1647 A.D., wisely said: “All things in
Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;
yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and
observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded, and opened in some
place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
sufficient understanding of them.” Not only the learned, but the
unlearned, can say to God in adoring gratitude, “Thy Word is a lamp unto
my feet, and a light unto my path… The entrance of Thy words giveth
light; it giveth understanding unto the simple” (Psalm 119:105, 130).

It is the purpose of this book of “Bible Studies” to use Scripture to
explain Scripture. Those who have read the author’s previous writings,
need not be told, that by long, patient, and prayerful study of God’s
Word, by thorough conviction of its Divine inspiration in every part, by
humble reliance upon the Holy Spirit to enlighten and guide him, he has,
through grace, obtained a wonderful skilled wisdom in putting together
various portions of the Bible, bearing upon different subjects. His
book, therefore, must be more valuable than any commentary, to all who
accept the following rules of Bible study:-

First. Be fully persuaded that “all Scripture is given by inspiration of
God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect,
throughly furnished unto all good works” (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The
profound reverence paid to the very words of Scripture by our Lord Jesus
Christ, and His inspired apostles, shows how true it is that “the
prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost” (2 Peter 1:21).

Second. Be humble as you sit face to face with God’s inerrant Word. “To
this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
and trembleth at My Word” (Isaiah 66:2). Few, alas! can say in these
days with the Psalmist, “My heart standeth in awe of Thy Word” (Psalm
119:161). Never forget, in reading the Bible, that “God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace to the humble” (James 4:6).

Third. Recognizing your dependence upon the Holy Spirit, you will be led
earnestly to seek His blessing, “that we might know the things that are
freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words
which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth;
comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man” (even in
a believer) “receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
spiritually discerned” (1 Cor. 2:12-14).

Fourth. Learn to find the Lord Jesus Christ everywhere in the Bible.
“Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and
they are they which testify of Me” (John 5:39). “Beginning at Moses and
all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the
things concerning Himself” (Luke 24:27).

Fifth. Do not neglect the Old Testament; “for whatsoever things were
written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope” (Romans 15:4).
“Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples (margin, types);
and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world
are come” (1 Corinthians 10:11).

Sixth. Peruse this book of “Bible Studies” with a desire to make its
teachings personal and practical. “Thy Word have I hid in mine heart,
that I might not sin against Thee” (Psalm 119:11). “Whosoever heareth
these sayings of Mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man,
which built his house upon a rock” (Matthew 7:24). “Why call ye Me,
Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” (Luke 6:46).

Seventh. Remember that, by the Word of God you are begotten, James 1:18;
you are born again, 1 Peter 1:23; you grow, 1 Peter 2:2; you are
cleansed, John 15:3; you are sanctified, John 17:17; you are built up,
Acts 20:32; you are prepared to be presented to Christ, Ephesians
5:26-27; you are defended amid the perils of the way, Ephesians 6:17;
and you patiently wait, “until the day dawn, and the day star arise in
your hearts,” 2 Peter 1:19. The blessed Bible is the only lamp which God
swings out in the darkness of the future.

* * * * *

\* Since Dr. Brookes wrote the above words of introduction, he has been
called into the Lord’s presence; hence, his words emphasizing the
importance and benefit of Bible study are of peculiar value, as they are
the words of one who is now “at home with the Lord.”

# 1. Abel

MANWARD, the Bible is a history of the children of God and the children
of the Wicked One. As there are to be seen near Interlaken, in
Switzerland, two streams which run into each other, the one a dirty
colour, and the other a blue colour; so the two seeds are plainly
distinguished in the Word of God. The saved and the unsaved. The
justified and the condemned. The sheltered and the exposed, as the
Israelites and the Egyptians in Egypt. The righteous and the
unrighteous, as Cain and Abel. Abel is the man of faith, and Cain is the
man of unbelief.

Abel, the Man of Faith. Faith in God is the indicator that tells out a
man’s attitude towards Him. Three C’s sum up the life of faith, namely,
confidence in God, consecration to God, and communion with God.

1.  **The Man of Faith acts according to God’s Word.** “By faith Abel
    offered,” &c. (Heb. 11:4). Presumption always acts upon its own
    authority, as in the case of the Egyptians when they would cross the
    bed of the Red Sea. Faith is guided by God’s utterance; from this we
    may infer that God had made known His will as to the manner in which
    He was to be approached.
2.  **The Man of Faith is regarded by God** (Genesis 4:4). The word
    “respect” is rendered “regard” in Exodus 5:9. We might, therefore,
    translate the words, “The Lord had regard,” &c. The Lord took
    special notice of Abel and his offering by looking upon them with
    delight. Christ is the One who is well-pleasing to God (Matt. 3:17),
    and in Him the believer is accepted (Eph 1:6).
3.  **The Man of Faith is envied by others** (Genesis 4:4). Cain would
    not bring the right offering himself, and he was envious of Abel,
    who did as God directed. It is the old story of the dog in the
    manger. The dog cannot eat the hay, nor will he allow the cow, who
    can.
4.  **The Man of Faith condemns the unrighteous** (1 John 3:12). If
    there is anything that rouses the enmity in the natural heart, it is
    when one acts in such a way as to condemn another. This was the
    cause of the hatred and malice of the Jews against the Lord Jesus.
    The clear, holy light of His life condemned the dark uncleanness of
    their conduct.
5.  **The Man of Faith is noted by God** (see Matt. 23:35; Luke 11:51;
    Heb. 11:4; 12:24; 1 John 3:12). No one can touch the man of faith
    without God making special note of it, for believers are His special
    treasure, and are as dear to Him as the apple of the eye to a
    person. Besides, the man of faith is regarded, as he is obedient,
    with the love of complacency by God.

# 2. A Blessing to All Nations

GENESIS 18:17-21

SEEING that Christ is of the “Seed of Abraham” (Matt. 1:1), the promise
to Abraham is specially fulfilled in Him, for He is the channel of all
blessing.

I purpose giving an acrostic on the word *Blessing*, as illustrating how
we are a blessing to others, or the class of people that are a blessing
to others.

 B. Blessed Ones. 
:   “I have known,” or “chosen him” (Genesis 18:19). We cannot possibly
    be a blessing without first being blessed. We must receive to give,
    as when the disciples received the bread and fish from the hands of
    Christ, and then gave them to the multitude. We must know, to make
    known, as when the apostles had seen Christ, the Risen One, then
    they were able to witness of Jesus and the Resurrection; and those
    who have met with Christ are able to invite others to meet with Him,
    as the woman of Samaria, who invited the Samaritans to come and see
    Christ, with whom she had conversed.
 L. Living Ones. 
:   Abraham was one who was in touch with the Living God, therefore he
    had life from Him, even as the branch of the tree owes its being and
    well-being to the tree. It is those who have life *from* Christ
    (John 5:24), life *in* Christ (Romans 8:2), life *with* Christ (Gal.
    2:20), and Christ *as* their Life, that are able to “hold forth the
    Word of Life” to others (Phil. 2:16), to their quickening and
    blessing (James 1:18), even as exemplified in Peter on the day of
    Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit ministered through him.
 E. Empowered Ones. 
:   In Matthew 28:18-20, we are told that Christ has “all power,” and
    “therefore” He bade His disciples to go and make disciples of all
    nations. All authority is vested in Christ, therefore He has
    authority to bid His disciples to act according to His instructions.
    His servants only have authority as they are under His authority.
    The centurion said he was “a man under authority,” therefore he said
    to one, “Come,” and he came, and to another “Go,” and he went
    (Matthew 8:9). It was because the centurion was under authority that
    he had authority. In like manner, as we are in the line of the
    Divine power by obedience to Christ, and as Christ the Power of God
    thus lives in us, we have power over others, even as the electric
    wire communicates the electricity because of its connection with the
    dynamo.
 S. Sent Ones. 
:   The word of the Lord Jesus to His disciples was “Go.” When the Lord
    bids us go on any errand, there should be prompt and persistent
    obedience (John 20:21).
 S. Sanctified Ones. 
:   The disciples were to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and
    Holy Spirit. The spiritual meaning of baptism into the Father, Son,
    and Holy Spirit is the entering into all they are. Into the Father,
    into His grace and love, to make us loving and gracious; into the
    Son, that is, into His life and liberty, that His liberty may free
    us, and that His life may energize us; and into the Holy Spirit,
    that His holiness and power may touch every part of our life. The
    immersion in water was but an illustration of the deeper truth of
    immersion into the blessings of the grace of the Gospel. Therefore
    it presupposes that those who were sent to baptize, knew the
    spiritual meaning and practical outcome of the ordinance they
    enjoined upon others.
 I. Initiated Ones 
:   (Genesis 18:17-18). Those who fear the Lord are sure to be in the
    secrets of the Lord (Psalm 25:14). The Lord delights to make known
    His ways to us if we are in touch with Himself, even as He did to
    Moses (Psalm 103:7). It was to Daniel that God revealed the king’s
    dream and the interpretation. The wise men of Babylon were baffled,
    but Daniel, the man of God, made known the forgotten dream (Daniel
    2). Again, Joseph was the one who interpreted Pharaoh’s dream. There
    are many illustrations in Holy Writ, to prove that it is only to
    God’s own people, and those of them who are in fellowship with Him,
    that God makes known the mysteries of the kingdom and of His Word
    (Matthew 13:11; 1 Cor. 2:9-14), that they may proclaim them to
    others (1 John 1:1-3).
 N. Nothings. 
:   Abraham confessed he was “dust and ashes” in the sight of the Lord
    (Genesis 18:27). It is easy to say we are “nothing,“ but to know it
    in reality is to be like Christ, who “made Himself of no
    reputation.“ Notice Paul’s growth in grace.
    -   “Least of the apostles“ (1 Cor. 15:9).
    -   “Less than the least of all saints“ (Eph. 3:8).
    -   “Chief of sinners“ (1 Tim. 1:15),
    -   “Nothing” (2 Cor. 12:11).

 G. Godly Ones. 
:   Those who know the God of blessing, by walking in fellowship with
    Him, as Enoch did, shall surely be a blessing from God to others. To
    be in touch with the God of Holiness, by union with Himself, must
    result in the holiness of God being transmitted in the presence of
    others, even as the atmosphere transmits the light. Those who know
    the God of Love by acting like Him, have the love of God. When a
    lady put a number of cakes into the dirty, ragged frock of a poor
    shoeless, hatless, hungry lassie, she was so filled with
    astonishment that she exclaimed, “Be you God’s wife, ma’am?” She
    knew God loved her, and she therefore thought that the God-like
    action of the lady indicated a near relative of His. It is not what
    we *say*, but how we *serve*, that shows our sanctity.

# 3. Abounding

1.  **Abound in Hope.** “That ye may *abound* in hope” (Romans 15:13).
2.  **Abound in Love.** “That your love may *abound*” (Phil. 1:9).
3.  **Abound in Faith.** “As ye *abound* in everything, in faith” (2
    Cor. 8:7).
4.  **Abound in our Walk.** “Ye ought to walk…so ye would *abound*” (1
    Thess. 4:1).
5.  **Abound in Grace.** “If these things be in you and *abound*” (2
    Peter 1:8).
6.  **Abound in every Good Work.** “In all things may *abound* to every
    good work” (2 Cor. 9:8).
7.  **Abound in Suffering.** “The sufferings of Christ *abound* in us”
    (2 Cor. 1:5).

# 4. Abraham and Sodom

GENESIS 18:22-33

1.  **Abraham’s Question relating to Sodom.** “Wilt thou also destroy
    the righteous with the wicked?” God never destroys the righteous
    with the wicked, as the following illustrations will evidence.
    1.  *Noah and the Antediluvians. When* Noah and his family were
        safely housed in the ark, then the flood-gates were opened, and
        the waters swept away all outside the vessel of safety (Gen.
        7:13, &c.).
    2.  *The firstborn of Israel and Egypt.* After the protecting blood
        of the lamb was sprinkled upon the door-posts of the Israelites,
        *then* the Lord smote the first-born of Egypt (Exodus 12:28-29).
    3.  *Israel and Korah.* It was *after* Israel had withdrawn from the
        tents of Korah and his followers, that the earth clave asunder
        and engulfed them (Numbers 16:26, &c.).
    4.  *The believer and unbeliever.* Before the Lord comes in judgment
        to banish the unbeliever from His presence, He will have
        gathered His redeemed to Himself; hence they are seen coming
        with Him (Rev. 19:14), and sitting in judgment as well (Rev.
        20:4; 1 Cor. 6:2-3).

    Matthew Henry says upon Abraham’s question, “First. The righteous
    are mingled with the wicked in this world. Amongst the best there
    are, commonly, some bad; and among the worst, some good. Even in
    Sodom, one Lot. Second. Though the righteous be among the wicked,
    yet the righteous God will not, certainly He will not, destroy the
    righteous with the wicked. Though in the world, they may be involved
    in the same calamities, yet, in the great day, a distinction will be
    made.”
2.  **Abraham’s Plea regarding Sodom.** Abraham’s plea was, that wicked
    Sodom should be spared for the sake of the righteous ones in it.
    There are two things suggested by the plea.
    1.  *That righteous men are preventative of judgment.* “Ye are the
        salt of the earth,” said Christ to His disciples. The saints are
        the salt of the earth, that keep the rest from rotting and
        putrefying. Many an ungodly man has been prevented from doing
        evil in the presence of one who was walking with God. I well
        remember a man hiding himself, one Sunday morning, in the
        bulrushes that were growing by the river Avon, because he had
        been working in his garden on the Lord’s Day; but his conscience
        smote him at the sight of a follower of Christ.
    2.  *The law of substitution suggested.* Ten righteous men would
        have been the salvation of Sodom, but Sodom would have been
        spared for others’ sake, and not for its own sake. Even so with
        the believer; he is saved and forgiven for the sake of Christ
        (Eph. 4:32; 1 John 2:12), who has borne all judgment for him.
        God sought in vain for a man to stand in the gap with reference
        to staying judgment upon Judah, and there was none (Ezek. 22:30;
        Jer. 5:1); but in Christ, there is One who stands in the breach,
        and takes the place of those who believe in Him.

3.  **Abraham’s Communion with the Lord about Sodom** (Gen 18:17, 33).
    God says more to Abraham about the destruction of Sodom than to
    anyone else, and herein God let him into His secrets. It was not to
    Lot, who is typical of a half-hearted Christian, that the purpose of
    God was made known, but to the faithful separated friend. To be
    initiated into Divine secrets and the wonders of God’s Word, we must
    be in whole-hearted fellowship with the Lord, even as the beloved
    John, being “in the Spirit,” was able to see and apprehend the
    wondrous symbols of the book of Revelation. It was not to the
    Sodomites that God’s purpose was revealed. They had long since
    dulled their moral sense by sin, and therefore were unable to hear
    the voice of God. The one thing that impresses me by this incident
    is, that God says more to His children about the punishment of the
    wicked, than to the wicked themselves. God told Noah about the
    Flood. The Lord informed Moses about the coming destruction of the
    first-born of Egypt. It was to Daniel that it was revealed that
    Christ should overthrow the world powers, as seen in the stone
    crushing the image to pieces (Daniel 2). It was to the disciples
    that Christ depicted the punishment of the wicked, who should “go
    away into eternal punishment” (Matt. 25:46). To the church at
    Thessalonica, was revealed the fact, that “eternal destruction is to
    be the portion of those who obey not the Gospel” (2 Thess. 1:9); and
    it was to the Apostle John that the scene of the last judgment was
    depicted (Rev. 20:11-15). There seems to be two reasons why the Lord
    tells His children so much about punishment, and these are, that
    they may realise the awful doom from which they have been rescued;
    and, second, that they may tell out with burning heart and lip, the
    wrath that is coming upon the ungodly.

# 5. A Bright Promise

“I WILL never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Heb. 13:5).

The frequency of the promise of God’s unfailing presence is very marked
in God’s Word.

1.  The **Promiser** of this promise―Jehovah (Gen. 28:15).
2.  The **ground** of this promise―covenant (Deut. 4:31).
3.  The **power** of this promise in conflict (Deut. 31:6).
4.  The **suitability** of this promise for special work (Deut. 31:8).
5.  The **certainty** of this promise (Joshua 1:5).
6.  The **reason** of the fulfilment of this promise (1 Sam. 12:22).
7.  The **stimulus** of this promise (1 Chron. 28:20).
8.  The **condition** to be fulfilled to know the truth of this promise
    (1 Kings 6:12-13).
9.  The **presentness, perfectness,** and **perpetuity** of this promise
    (Psalm 37:28-33).
10. This promise is **valid**, although saints may not always realize it
    (Psalm 94:14).
11. The **class of people** that appreciate this promise (Is. 41:17).
12. The **immutability** of this promise (Heb. 13:5-6).

# 6. Abundance

1.  **Saved in abundant grace.** “Where sin *abounded*” (Rom. 5:20).
2.  **Blessed according to abundant mercy.** “Which according to His
    *abundant* mercy hath begotten us again” (1 Peter 1:3).
3.  **Energised with abundant life.** “That they might have life, and
    that they might have it more *abundantly*” (John 10:10).
4.  **Calmed in abundant peace.** “*Abundance* of peace as long as the
    moon endured” (Psalm 72:7).
5.  **Rejoiced with abundant joy.** “Your joy may be more *abundant* in
    Christ Jesus” (Phil. 1:26).
6.  **Satisfied with abundant goodness.** “They shall be *abundantly*
    satisfied with the goodness of Thy house” (Ps. 36:8).
7.  **Prayer answered in abundant manner.** “Able to do exceeding
    *abundantly*” (Eph. 3:20).

# 7. A Golden Chain of Blessing

“BLESS the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: Who
*forgiveth* all thine iniquities; Who *healeth* all thy diseases; Who
*redeemeth* thy life from destruction; Who *crowneth* thee with
*lovingkindness* and *tender mercies*; Who *satisfieth* thy mouth with
good things; so that thy youth is *renewed* like the eagle’s” (Psalm
103:1-5). Notice seven things in these verses that the Psalmist blesses
God for:―

1.  **Forgiveness.** All, not some of, the past sins forgiven, and not
    only so, but forgotten. In the eleventh of Hebrews, where we have
    recorded what faith has done, there is not a single word about the
    failures of these Old Testament saints. Why is this? Because, in the
    tenth chapter, God had said, “Your sins and iniquities I will
    remember no more.”
2.  **Healing.** It is the privilege of the child of God to know, that
    He can, if He wills, heal us of all our bodily as well as spiritual
    diseases.
3.  **Redemption.** Not only past sins forgiven, but deliverance from
    the power of sin, and soon from its presence.
4.  **Lovingkindness.** Some people will do a kindness out of mere
    benevolence, but there is no love with it; not so with our Father.
    Recently, we saw an advertisement of a certain paper, which said it
    was the brightest, biggest, and best. Whether that is so or not, it
    is not for us to say; but we do know this, that our Heavenly Father
    gives the brightest, biggest, and the very best He has to give to
    us. Hence, in speaking, we have to get all the adjectives we can to
    express in some measure what He gives. His love is *great* love; His
    kindness is *lovingkindness*; His mercy is *tender, great,
    plenteous,* and *everlasting*.
5.  **Tender Mercies.** Not doles of charity, but mercies given out of
    His loving, Fatherly heart, by virtue of His Son’s work, and enjoyed
    in the Spirit.
6.  **Satisfaction.** One of the Puritans has said that “man’s heart is
    a triangle, so that if the whole world were in it, there would be
    still three corners left unfilled.” But the believer has the work of
    Christ to satisfy his conscience, the word of the Father to assure
    his mind, and the presence of the Holy Spirit to fill his heart, so
    that there is not a single corner unoccupied.
7.  **Renewing.** I remember a friend saying once, when going to a place
    to hold special meetings, “We are looking for a revival;” and I
    replied that it showed they were in a bad state, as the Christian
    should *live in a revival*. Our inward man is, or should be, renewed
    day by day, not only when an evangelist is holding special meetings.

    grace abound* towards you” (2 Cor. 9:8).

    *grace* of God…exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart” (Acts
    11:23).

    suffering.** “My *grace* is sufficient for thee…I glory in mine
    infirmities” (2 Cor. 12:9).
4.  **All Sustaining Grace to uphold us at all times.** “God is able to
    make all *grace abound*…always” (2 Cor. 9:8).
5.  **All Stablishing Grace in making us steadfast.** “It is a good
    thing that the heart be established with *grace*” (Heb. 13:9).
6.  **All Serving Grace to enable us to minister.** “And His *grace*
    which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured” (1 Cor.
    15:10).
7.  **All Supplying Grace to meet every need.** “And of His fulness have
    all we received, and *grace for grace*” (John 1:16).

# 10. All Saints

he attended three churches, viz., ‘Holy Trinity,’ ‘Christ’s Church,’ and

    Hebrews 13:24).
4.  **The saints’ salutations.** “*All* the *saints* salute you” (2 Cor.
    13:13; Phil. 4:22).
5.  **Paul’s Epistle to the Philippians.** “*All* the *saints* in Christ
    Jesus” (Phil. 1:1).
6.  **Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians.** “May be able to comprehend with
    *all saints*” (Eph. 3:18).
7.  **Paul’s Exhortation to the Ephesians.** “Praying always…for *all
    saints*” (Eph. 6:18).

    Philemon 5).

# 11. “Alls” of Separation

    saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord” (2 Kings 23:21).

# 14. Alphabet on the Second Coming of Christ

THERE are many ways by which we may arrive at the importance of any
given subject. The person who is an authority as a specialist makes his
utterance of value when he speaks upon a topic; the issues that are
involved, give weight and interest to a discussion; the probable results
will influence to a certain course of action; and the frequency with
which a truth is brought before us in Holy Writ, will make itself felt
to the prayerful student of the Word of God. All the above pleas may be
applied to the blessed hope of Christ’s second coming. He who says “I
come again” is the Son of God―God the Son―therefore His word is valid.
The issues at stake are of pressing importance. The overthrow of evil,
the binding of Satan, universal peace, righteousness exalted, and God
glorified, are issues that are involved as the truth of Christ’s return
is pondered in its wider aspect. The results of the apprehended fact of
Christ’s near approach will make the believer holy in life; and the
blessings attendant upon Christ’s arrival, to the Church, and the world,
are beyond our telling and ken. The frequency with which reference is
made to a truth must have the effect of awakening our interest and
riveting our attention. This is remarkably true in relation to the topic
before us, viz., the return of our Lord. As illustrating the repeated
utterance of the Holy Spirit in speaking of this subject, and the
results produced, and the commands incumbent upon us in looking for our
Lord Jesus, we shall give the following alphabetical outline:―

**A. Abiding** in Christ is the position that He should find us in when
He comes. “And now, little children, *abide* in Him; that when He shall
appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before Him at His
*coming*” (1 John 2:28).

**B. Blamelessness** of life is the normal condition in which we should
seek to be when Christ arrives. “He may stablish your hearts
*unblameable* in holiness before our God and Father at the *coming* of
our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thess. 3:13). “Your whole spirit and soul and
body be preserved *blameless* unto the *coming* of our Lord Jesus
Christ” (1 Thess. 5:23; 1 Cor. 1:8; 2 Peter 3:14; Jude 24, R.V.).

**C. Comfort** in bereavement is found in the truth of Christ’s return.
“But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
which are asleep, that ye *sorrow not*, even as others which have no
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus *will God bring with Him*. For this we say
unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain
unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For
the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore *comfort one another* with
these words” (1 Thess. 4:13-18).

**D. Deliverance** to the groaning creation from the bondage of
corruption will be given at Christ’s arrival. “For the earnest
expectation of the creature *waiteth* for the manifestation of the sons
of God.” “Because the creature itself also shall be *delivered* from the
*bondage of corruption* into the glorious liberty of the children of
God” (Rom. 8:19-21).

**E. Encouragement** to endure amid persecution is one of the supports
that Christ’s coming gives. “So that we ourselves glory in you in the
churches of God for your patience and faith in all your *persecutions*
and *tribulations* that ye *endure*: which is a manifest token of the
righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom
of God, for which ye also suffer: seeing it is a righteous thing with
God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you: and to you who
are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them
that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ” (2 Thess. 1:4-8).

**F. Faithfulness** in Christian service is one of the marks of belief
in Christ’s return. “Moreover it is required in *stewards*, that a man
be found *faithful*. But with me it is a very small thing that I should
be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not my own self.
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but He that
judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, *until
the Lord come*, Who both will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then
shall every man have praise of God” (1 Cor. 4:2-5).

**G. Gladness** of spirit is a result now and hereafter, as we are
looking for the approach of Christ. “Inasmuch as ye are partakers of
Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of His glory also
ye may rejoice with exceeding joy” (1 Peter 4:13).

**H. Holiness** of life is the outcome of living in the expectancy of
Christ. “The God of peace Himself *sanctify* you wholly; and may your
spirit and soul and body be preserved entire at the *coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ*” (1 Thess. 5:23, R.V.).

**I. Immortality** and incorruptibility are assured blessings when our
Lord comes back. “Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump: For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
*incorruptible*, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put
on *incorruption*, and this mortal must put on *immortality*. So when
this corruptible shall have put on *incorruption*, and this mortal shall
have put on *immortality*, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written, death is swallowed up in victory” (1 Cor. 15:50-54).

**J. Justly** shall we act in all our dealings if we are looking for
Christ’s return. “The grace of God which bringeth salvation …teaching
us, that…we should live soberly, righteously” (same word translated
“*justly*” in 1 Thess. 2:10), “and godly, in this present world, looking
for that *blessed hope*,” &c. (Titus 2:11-13).

**K. Keeping** to the confession of the Lord’s coming should
characterize all who believe in Him. “*Hold fast*” (the same word is
rendered “keep” in Luke 8:15) “the *confession* of your hope that it
waver not” (Heb. 10:23, R.V.).

**L. Likeness** to Christ is produced as we are looking for Him. “Every
man that hath this hope set on Him *purifieth himself*, even as *He is
pure*” (1 John 2:3, R.V.).

**M. Manifestation** in glory with Christ is brought before us as we
think of His return. “When Christ, who is our Life, shall be
*manifested*, then shall we be *manifested* with Him in *glory*” (Col.
3:4, R.V.).

**N. Nearness** of the believer’s completed salvation is proclaimed as
we think of Christ’s coming. “Now is our salvation *nearer* than when we
believed” (Rom. 13:11).

**O. Occupation** for Christ in trading with the pound of the Gospel is
our work till He returns. “*Occupy till I come*” (Luke 19:13).

**P. Patience** is a grace that is to be exercised till our Lord
arrives. “Ye have need of *patience*, that after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise” (Heb. 10:36-37). “*Be
patient*…brethren, unto the *coming* of the Lord” (James 5:7).

**Q. Quietude** of heart is ministered to us as we think of our
returning Lord; for He shall adjust all things when He arrives (1 Thess.
5:1-11). “Let us, who are of the day, be *sober*, putting on the
breastplate of faith and love: and for a helmet, the hope of salvation”
(1 Thess. 5:8).

**R. Redemption** of the body will take place when our Lord comes: for
this we are waiting. “Waiting for the adoption, to wit, the *redemption
of our body*” (Rom. 8:23).

**S. Stimulus** to Christian service is imparted as we keep in memory
our Lord’s return. “I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ
Jesus, Who shall judge the quick and the dead, and by *His appearing*
(R.V.) and kingdom: *preach the word; be instant in season, out of
season*,” &c. (2 Tim. 4:1-2).

**T. Threefold** work of Christ will be complete when He appears. See
the threefold appearing mentioned in Heb. 9:24-28.

**U. Untilness** of Scripture will be fulfilled when Christ comes back.
See the seven “Untils” in Luke 19:13, Acts 3:21 (R.V.), Rom. 11:25, 1
Cor. 11:26, 1 Cor. 4:5, Phil. 1:6, and Rev. 2:25.

**V. Vigilance** is commanded by Christ till He comes. “Take ye heed,
*watch* and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of man
is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority
to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to
watch. *Watch ye* therefore: for ye know not when the Master of the
house *cometh*, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in
the morning: lest coming suddenly He find you sleeping. And what I say
unto you I say unto all, *Watch*” (Mark 13:33-37).

**W. Waiting** for Christ is to be our attitude. “*Wait* for His Son” (1
Thess. 1:10). “We *wait* for the Saviour” (Phil. 3:20). “To them that
*wait* for Him” (Heb. 9:28, R.V.).

**X. ’Xcellent** glory is that into which we shall enter at the coming
of Christ. “We made known unto you the power and *coming* of our Lord
Jesus Christ…*excellent glory*” (2 Peter 1:16-17).

**Y. Yieldingness** is a grace that is begotten by the apprehended fact
of Christ’s coming. “Let your *moderation*” (yieldingness) “be known
unto all men. The Lord is at hand” (Phil. 4:5).

**Z. Zeal** is inspired as we are expecting Christ. “Looking for and
*earnestly desiring* the coming of the day of God” (2 Peter 3:12, R.V.).

5.  **Necessity.** It must be. “*Verily*, I say” (John 3:3).
6.  **Certainty.** It is. “Promises in Him, Amen” (2 Cor. 1:20).
7.  **Acquiescence.** Let it be. “*Even* *so*, Father” (Matt. 11:26).



# 18. Angelic Ministry

1.  ANGELS **point** out the way we should go (Ex. 23:20; 32:34).
2.  Angels **prepare** us for coming conflict (Judges 6:11-22).
3.  Angels **provide** for our need in times of discouragement (1 Kings
    19:5).
4.  Angels **protect** us in times of danger (2 Kings 6:17; Psalm 34:7).
5.  Angels **prevent** harm from coming to us (Dan. 3:28; 6:22).
6.  Angels **pull us out** of difficulties (Gen. 19:16; Acts 12:7-11).
7.  Angels **preserve** us in all our journeyings (Gen. 24:7, 40; Isaiah
    63:9).



# 19. An Illustration of Grace

MATTHEW 21:1-7

As the Lord needed the colt upon which He rode into Jerusalem, so He
needs every sinner. “Not a very complimentary simile to compare us to an
ass!” says one. We often find that man is compared to animals in the
Scriptures. He is compared to a sow for uncleanness (2 Peter 2:22), to a
sheep for stupidity (Isaiah 53:6), to a dog as an object of contempt
(Matt. 15:26), and to an ass for his wildness and wilfulness (Job
11:12). I am, therefore, warranted in taking the ass as illustrating the
condition the sinner is in, and what the Lord is willing to do for him.

1.  As the ass was “tied” (Matt. 21:2), so the sinner is under the
    bondage of sin (Gal. 3:22).
2.  As the ass was “without” (Mark 11:4)―not in a comfortable stable―so
    the sinner is without the blessings of the covenant (Eph. 2:12).
3.  As the ass was in a place where two ways met (Mark 11:4), so the
    sinner is where two paths are found in this life―the broad and the
    narrow way (Matt. 7:13).
4.  As the colt had never been ridden on, therefore, had been of no use
    (Matt. 21:2); so the sinner is useless to God, for they who are in
    the flesh cannot please Him (Rom. 8:8).
5.  As the colt was known by Christ before it was brought to Him (Matt.
    21:2), and He directed where and how it would be found; so Christ
    knew us before we knew Him, and He gives in detail our natural
    character in Rom. 3:
6.  As the colt was loosed by a power outside itself (Matt. 21:2), so
    the grace of God is the only power that can free us from the
    consequence and control of sin (Eph. 2:5).
7.  As the colt was brought to Christ (Matt. 21:7), so the Holy Spirit
    is the Power that leads us to the Lamb of God, who takes away our
    sin (Acts 26:18).
8.  As the colt was used by Christ (Matt. 21:7), so those who are
    brought to Christ are used by Him (Col. 1:29).
9.  As the colt was needed by Christ (Matt. 21:3), so He needs all His
    people to carry out His purpose, even as the head needs the members
    of the body to accomplish its will (1 Cor. 12:12).

# 20. Anna

“SOMETIMES the sun seems to hang for half an hour in the horizon, only
just to show how glorious it can be. The day is gone, the fervour of the
shining is over, and the sun hangs golden―nay, redder than gold―in the
west, making everything look unspeakably beautiful with the rich
effulgence which it sheds on every side. So God seems to let some
people, when their duty in this world is done, hang in the west, that
men may look on them, and see how beautiful they are.” Such was the aged
Anna.

1.  **Anna was a prophetess** (Luke 2:36). As a prophet was one who
    received messages from God, through being in immediate communication
    with Him, so a prophetess was the same. Dr. Bullinger says, “The
    usage of the word is clear, it signifies one on whom the Spirit of
    God rested (Num. 11:17, 25-26, 29); one to whom and through whom God
    speaks (Num. 12:2); one to whom God makes known His mysteries (Amos
    3:7-8). Hence it means one to whom God reveals His truth, and
    through whom He speaks” (Gen. 20:7, 17-18).
2.  **Anna was a servant of God** (Luke 2:37). It is said of her that
    she “served God.” What better epitaph could one have, than a
    testimony of having served the Lord? “Ye serve the Lord Christ”
    (Col. 3:24) was the apostle’s word to the Christian slaves at
    Colosse as he urged them to do their menial tasks as unto the Lord
    Himself. A carpenter was once asked why he troubled to finish off a
    magistrate’s bench so carefully. His reply was, “I can’t do
    otherwise; besides, I may have to sit on it one of these days.” A
    better reply was given by the little servant girl when she was asked
    why she took such pains in washing the doorstep, “I am doing it for
    the Lord Jesus.” Ah! if anything be done for, and as to Him it will
    be done well.
3.  **Anna was self-denying.** It is said she fasted (Luke 2:37). Anna
    did not fast, as some do, to obtain favour with God, but, knowing
    the grace of the Lord, she was willing to deny herself food that she
    might serve the Lord better.
4.  **Anna was prayerful** (Luke 2:37). Her prayers ascended to God
    “night and day.” She was incessant in her pleading, and attentive in
    her attendance at the means of grace. An old writer says, “Prayer is
    the *key* of the morning and the *lock* of the evening.” If we pray
    each morning before we go out on life’s pathway, we shall unlock the
    mercies God has for us; and if we look to Him at the close of the
    day, we shall know that we are locked in with God from all harm and
    evil, as Noah was when the Lord shut him in the ark.
5.  **Anna was thankful.** Simeon was not alone in his thanksgiving, for
    Anna “gave thanks likewise unto the Lord” (Luke 2:38). Praise is
    comely to the Lord. Those who bless God with their praises are sure
    to be blessed by God with His mercies. A thankful man is full of
    blessing. To be thankless is to be graceless, but to be thankful is
    to be graceful.
6.  **Anna was a true witness.** “She spake of Him” (Luke 2:38). Her
    testimony of Christ as the Redeemer, is implied in that she “spake
    of Him to all that looked for *redemption* in Jerusalem.” A true
    witness always tells out what Christ is, what He has done, and what
    He is able to do, as known from personal experience.

# 21. As He Is Versus As He Was

1.  **As He *is*.** He is walking in majesty in the midst of the
    Churches. “Who walketh in the midst of the seven golden
    candlesticks” (Rev. 2:1).\
     **As He *was*.** He was seen in humiliation, and in the midst of
    two thieves, crucified. “They crucified Him, and two other with Him,
    on either side one, and Jesus in the midst” (John 19:18).
2.  **As He *is*.** He is girt about the breast, signifying His priestly
    kingship. “And girt about the paps with a golden girdle” (Rev.
    1:13).\
     **As He *was*.** He was seen girded about the loins, signifying Him
    who came not to be ministered to, but to minister. “Took a towel,
    and girded Himself” (John 13:4).
3.  **As He *is*.** He is seen in garments of glory, representing the
    glory of His person. “Clothed with a garment down to the foot”
    (Revelation 1:13).\
     **As He *was*.** He was stripped of His garments, and made a
    spectacle to men, demons, and angels. “Took His garments, and made
    four parts” (John 19:23).
4.  **As He *is*.** We see His head, and His hairs are white―telling us
    of His glory and eternity. “His head and His hairs were white like
    wool” (Revelation 1:14).\
     **As He *was*.** That head was crowned with thorns―telling us of
    Him who bore the cross and curse for us. “The soldiers platted a
    crown of thorns, and put it on His head” (John 19:2).
5.  **As He *is*.** His eyes are as flames of fire―reminding us of His
    all-seeingness. “His eyes were as a flame of fire” (Rev. 1:14).\
     **As He *was*.** Those eyes lost their brightness in death, and
    closed under the load of sin. “And He bowed His head, and gave up
    the ghost” (John 19:30).
6.  **As He *is*.** His feet are as burning and polished brass―telling
    us of His durability and deity. “His feet like unto fine brass, as
    if they burned in a furnace” (Rev. 1:15).\
     **As He *was*.** Those feet were nailed to the Cross. “Behold My
    hands and My feet” (Luke 24:39).
7.  **As He *is*.** His voice is as the sound of many waters, reminding
    us of the power of His word. “His voice as the sound of many waters”
    (Rev. 1:15).\
     **As He *was*.** His voice was hushed in death. “Saw that He was
    dead” (John 19:33).
8.  **As He *is*.** His hand is mighty to hold, and to help us. “He had
    in His right hand seven stars” (Rev. 1:16).\
     **As He *was*.** Those hands were pierced, and nailed to the
    accursed tree. “They pierced My hands” (Psalm 22:16).
9.  **As He *is*.** Out of His mouth, goes a sharp twoedged
    sword―telling us of His power to destroy His enemies. “Out of His
    mouth went a sharp twoedged sword” (Rev. 1:16).\
     **As He *was*.** He opened not His mouth, but was smitten by the
    officer over the mouth. “Yet He opened not His mouth” (Isa. 53:7).
10. **As He *is*.** His face is as the sun shining in his strength. “His
    countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength” (Rev. 1:16).\
     **As He *was*.** That face was marred, spit on, the hair plucked
    from, and the rude hand of man insulted. “His visage was so marred
    more than any man” (Isaiah 52:14).

# 22. Asking

1.  **Who to ask―**\
     **Our Heavenly Father.** “Whatsoever ye shall *ask* of the *Father*
    in My name” (John 15:16).
2.  **How to ask―**\
     In the name of Christ. “Whatsoever ye shall *ask* in *My name*, I
    will do it” (John 14:13).\
     In the power of the Spirit. “Likewise the *Spirit* also *helpeth*
    our infirmities” (Rom. 8:26; Eph. 2:18).\
     In faith. “And all things, whatsoever ye shall *ask* in prayer,
    *believing*, ye shall receive” (Matt. 21:22; James 1:6).
3.  **What to ask for―**\
     **Help** of the Lord. “And Judah gathered themselves together, to
    *ask help of the Lord*” (2 Chron. 20:4).\
     **Fulness** of the Spirit. “How much more shall your heavenly
    Father give the *Holy Spirit* to them that *ask* Him” (Luke 11:13).\
     Fulness of **joy**. “*Ask*, and ye shall receive, that your *joy*
    may be *full*” (John 16:24).\
     **Wisdom.** “If any of you lack *wisdom*, let him *ask* of God”
    (James 1:5).\
     **Anything.** “If ye shall *ask anything* in My name, I will do it”
    (John 14:14).
4.  **The Condition―**\
     Abiding in Christ. “If ye *abide* in Me, and My words abide in you,
    ye shall *ask* what ye will” (John 15:7; 1 John 3:22).
5.  **Encouragements to ask―**\
     Promise of Christ. “I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall *ask* the
    Father in My name, *He will give it*” (John. 16:23).\
     He heareth us. “If we *ask* anything according to His will, *He
    heareth us*” (1 John 5:14-15).\
     Christ praying. “*I will pray* the Father for you” (John 16:26).

# 23. Aspects of the Gospel

1.  **Gospel of God.** “Separated unto the *gospel of God*” (Rom. 1:1).
2.  **Gospel of the grace of God.** “I have received of the Lord Jesus,
    to testify the *gospel of the grace of God*” (Acts 20:24).
3.  **Gospel of Jesus Christ.** “The beginning of the *gospel of Jesus
    Christ*” (Mark 1:1).
4.  **Gospel of Christ.** “I am not ashamed of the *gospel of Christ*”
    (Rom. 1:16).
5.  **Gospel of uncircumcision.** “When they saw that the *gospel of the
    uncircumcision* was committed unto me” (Gal. 2:7).
6.  **Gospel of peace.** “Your feet shod with the preparation of the
    *gospel of peace*” (Eph. 6:15).
7.  **Everlasting Gospel.** “Having the *everlasting gospel* to preach
    unto them that dwell on the earth” (Rev. 14:6).

\




# 24. Atonement of Christ

THE atonement that Christ made upon the cross when He died is the

1.  **Source** of all our spiritual blessing (Eph. 1:7).
2.  **Separating** power in holiness (Heb. 13:12).
3.  **Spring** in service (2 Cor. 5:14).
4.  **Success** in conflict (Rev. 12:11).
5.  **Solace** in trouble (Heb. 12:2-3).
6.  **Stay** in bereavement (1 Thess. 4:14).
7.  **Sufficiency** in glory (Rev. 7:14).

# 25. Authority of Christ

1.  CHRIST has authority over all flesh (John 17:2, R.V.).
2.  Christ has all authority given to Him in heaven and earth (Matt.
    28:18, R.V.).
3.  Christ had authority from His Father to lay down His life (John
    10:18). The word “*power*” in this verse is the same that is
    rendered “authority” in John 17:2, R.V.
4.  Christ has authority to forgive sins (Matt. 9:6, margin, R.V.).
5.  Christ gives authority to those who receive Him, to be the children
    of God (John 1:12). The word “power” is the same as “authority” in
    John 5:27.
6.  Christ gave His disciples authority over disease and demons when He
    was here on earth (Matt. 10:1, R.V.).
7.  Christ has authority to execute judgment (John 5:27).

# 26. Being Saved

“Saved in His life” (Romans 5:10, M.).

THE remedy against all sin is Christ. As Ulysses, in the Odyssey, was
safe from the enchantments of Circe, because of a certain herb which he
possessed; so those who have Christ, and whom Christ has, possess an
antidote against all inconsistencies.

1.  The **Meekness** of Christ shall save from intemperance in dress, as
    His Word is followed (1 Peter 3:3-5).
2.  The **Love** of Christ shall save from evil habit, as that love
    fills the being by obedience (Luke 7:47; John 14:21).
3.  The **Power** of Christ shall save from stumbling into the snares of
    sin, as we trust in Him (Jude 24, R.V.).
4.  The **Spirit** of Christ shall save from failure, as we are filled
    with Him, through waiting upon Him (Acts 4:33).
5.  The **Holiness** of Christ shall save from unlikeness to Christ, as
    we abide in Him (John 15:5).
6.  The **Zeal** of Christ shall save from laziness in the Lord's
    service, as we are fired by Him (1 Cor. 15:58).
7.  The **Coming** of Christ shall save us from discouragement, as we
    are looking for Him (James 5:7).

# 27. Believers' Attitudes & Relations to Christ

1.  **Walking with Him,** as the two disciples to Emmaus (Luke 24:15),
    is *revelation*.
2.  **Talking with Him,** as Moses and Elias did on the mount of
    transfiguration (Luke 9:30), is *fellowship*.
3.  **Listening to Him,** as Mary of Bethany (Luke 10:39), is
    *instruction*.
4.  **Abiding with Him,** as the two disciples mentioned in John 1:39,
    is *joy*.
5.  **Living with Him,** as the disciples of John, is *oneness* (John
    1:39).
6.  **Waiting upon Him,** as the early Christians, is *power* (Acts
    4:31).
7.  **Watching for Him,** as the people were waiting for Christ, is
    *expectancy* (Luke 8:40).

# 28. Believers Have a Common Interest in Christ

1.  PARTAKERS from Him of one **common life.** “Quickened *us* together
    with Christ” (Eph. 2:5).
2.  In Him they have a **common interest in His atonement.** “In whom
    *we* have redemption” (Col. 1:14).
3.  Saved in Him by a **common salvation.** “To write unto you of the
    *common* salvation” (Jude 3).
4.  Related through Him to one **common Father.** “*All* the children of
    God by faith in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:26).
5.  Sheep by Him in one **common flock.** “There shall be *one* flock”
    (John 10:16, R.V.).
6.  Stones on Him in one beautiful and **common temple.** “*Ye* also, as
    lively stones, are built up a spiritual house” (1 Peter 2:5).
7.  Branches in Him as partaking of a **common life.** “I am the Vine,
    *ye* are the branches” (John 15:5).
8.  Sharers with Him of one **common glory.** “Be with Me where I am;
    that *they* may behold My glory” (John 17:24).

# 29. Benefits of Christ's Resurrection

THERE are so many benefits associated with the resurrection of Christ,
that we can only give a few. The following seven are among the many:―

1.  Blessing (Acts 3:26).
2.  Justification (Romans 4:24-25).
3.  Holiness (2 Cor. 5:15).
4.  Power (Eph. 1:20).
5.  Fruit-bearing (Romans 7:4).
6.  Quickening (Romans 8:11).
7.  Pledge of our loved ones who have fallen asleep coming with Christ
    (1 Thess. 4:14).

# 30. Better

THE key word of the Epistle to the Hebrews is the term “*Better*.” It
occurs no less than *thirteen* times (Heb. 1:4; Heb. 6:9; Heb. 7:7, Heb.
7:19, Heb. 7:22; Heb. 8:6; Heb. 9:23; Heb. 10:34; Heb. 11:16, Heb.
11:35, Heb. 11:40; Heb. 12:24). The word is rendered “*Best*” in 1 Cor.
12:31, and, as it will be seen, it means that which is of greater power
and effect. It will be noticed that prophets, angels and men are placed
in contrast with Christ, and as the stars pale in the presence of the
sun, so all these are eclipsed by Him.

1.  **Christ is better than the prophets because He is The Prophet.**
    1.  Christ is better in His *utterance*, because He is the Living
        Word of God, and God the Word (Heb. 1:2).
    2.  Christ is better in His *relation* to God. He is the Son of God,
        God the Son, and “Heir of all things” (Heb. 1:2).
    3.  Christ is better in His *person*. The prophets were creatures.
        Christ is Creator: “He made the worlds” (Heb. 1:2).
    4.  Christ is better in His *glory*. The prophets were but men;
        Christ is “The brightness of God's glory” (Heb. 1:3).
    5.  Christ is better in His *likeness to God*. He is the “express
        image,” &c. The image of God in Him is not blurred by sin (Heb.
        1:3).
    6.  Christ is better in His *power*. The prophets were upheld: He
        upholds (Heb. 1:3).
    7.  Christ is better in His *work* (Heb. 1:3). The prophets could
        not take away their own sins, leave alone others, but He could
        take away the sins of others.
    8.  Christ is better in His *place* (Heb. 1:3). He is seated at the
        right hand of God: the prophets could only occupy the servant's
        place.

2.  **Christ is better than the angels.**
    1.  Christ is better because He is the Son, and they are servants
        (Heb. 1:5).
    2.  Because He is the Object of the angels' worship, and they are
        the worshippers (Heb. 1:6).
    3.  Because He rules, and they are ruled (Heb. 1:7-8).
    4.  Because He is on the throne to reign, and they are before the
        throne to serve (Heb. 1:8-14).

3.  **Christ is better than the best, if we think who He is.**
    -   He is the Son of God: God the Son to accomplish (Heb. 1:2).
    -   The Heir of all things, to occupy (Heb. 1:2).
    -   The Creator, with Almighty power (Heb. 1:2).
    -   The Brightness of God's glory in beauty (Heb. 1:3).
    -   The Personification of God's Person in character (Heb. 1:3).
    -   The Sustainer of all things in power (Heb. 1:3).
    -   The Sacrifice to purge away sins (Heb. 1:3).
    -   The Exalted One at the right hand of God in honour (Heb. 1:3).
    -   The Object of angels' worship (Heb. 1:4).
    -   The Delight of the Father (Heb. 1:5).
    -   The Righteous King in rule (Heb. 1:8).
    -   The One above His fellows in eminence (Heb. 1:9).
    -   Unchanging One in immutability (Heb. 1:10-12).
    -   Jesus in humiliation (Heb. 2:9).
    -   Grace in death (Heb. 2:9).
    -   The End to which all things converge (Heb. 2:10).
    -   The Source of all things (Heb. 2:10).
    -   The Captain of Salvation in endurance (Heb. 2:10).
    -   The Sanctifier in holiness (Heb. 2:11).
    -   The Brother among His brethren in adversity (Heb. 2:11).
    -   The Leader in praise (Heb. 2:12).
    -   The Kinsman in redemption (Heb. 2:14).
    -   The Redeemer in avenging (Heb. 2:14).
    -   The Deliverer in emancipation (Heb. 2:15).
    -   The Merciful and Faithful High Priest to represent (Heb. 2:17).
    -   The Reconciler in atonement (Heb. 2:17).
    -   The Tried One in sympathy and succour (Heb. 2:18).


# 31. Beware

“Beware lest thou forget the Lord” (Deut. 6:12).

WE often see such notices as these:― “Beware of the Dog,” or “Beware of
Pickpockets;” but there is one we never see, and that is, “Beware of
Self.” “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.” We
read recently of the author of a book on the “Dangers of Alpine
Climbing, with Practical Advice to Tourists,” having himself lost his
life while ascending a mountain. Beware, worker, lest you should fall
into the things that you warn others against.

1.  Beware of the **word** of the Lord to do it (Deut. 6:12; 8:11).
2.  Beware of **wine**―the symbol of earthly pleasure (Jud. 13:4-13).
3.  Beware of the **wiles** of self-righteousness (Matt. 16:6).
4.  Beware of the **world** of covetousness (Luke 12:15).
5.  Beware of the **wickedness** of wicked men (Phil. 3:2).
6.  Beware of the **wisdom** of man (Col. 2:8; Matt. 7:15; 10:17).
7.  Beware of **wresting** the Scriptures (2 Peter 3:16-17).

# 33. Blamelessness

BLAMELESS. Faultless we can never be; blameless we must be.

1.  Blamelessness of **Heart**. “To the end that He may stablish your
    hearts *unblameable*” (1 Thess. 3:13).
2.  Blamelessness of **Life**. “*Unblameably* we behaved ourselves” (1
    Thess. 2:10).

    harmless . . . . . in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation”
    (Phil. 2:15).
4.  Blamelessness in **Service**. “Walking in all the commandments and
    ordinances of the Lord *blameless*” (Luke 1:6).
5.  Blamelessness in the **Whole Being**. “I pray God your whole spirit
    and soul and body be preserved *blameless*” (1 Thess. 5:23).

# 34. Blessing

6.  The **path** of blessing is *obedience* (Matt. 5:3-11).
7.  The **character** of blessing is *spiritual* (Eph. 1:3).
8.  The **outcome** of blessing is *separation* (Acts 3:26).
9.  The **consummation** of blessing is at *Christ’s return* (Titus
    2:13).

# 37. Blood of Christ

“This Man’s blood” (Acts 5:28).

MANY have found that the “Blood of this Man” is-

1.  The **harbinger of peace.** “Made peace through the blood of His
    cross” (Col. 1:20).
2.  The **harbour of refuge.** “Who have fled for refuge to lay hold
    upon the hope set before us” (Heb. 6:18).

4.  Boasting **in the glory of God.** “*Rejoice* in hope of the glory of
    God” (Rom. 5:2).
5.  Boasting **in the grace that is seen in others.** “Great is our
    *glorying* in you” (2 Cor. 7:4; 2 Cor. 9:2; 2 Thess. 1:4).
6.  Boasting **in infirmities.** “*Glory* in mine infirmities” (2 Cor.
    12:9).
7.  Boasting **in apostleship.** “I have therefore whereof I may
    *glory*” (Rom. 15:17).

The words of the above Scriptures which are in italics are one and the
same in the original, and is rendered “*boast*” in 2 Cor. 9:4; 10:8, 13,
15-16.

# 39. Bondage of Sin

**Israel’s bondage in Egypt is an illustration of the sinner’s bondage
in sin.** Egypt is a type of the world; Pharaoh is a type of Satan; and
the bondage an illustration of the enslaving power of sin. Different men
are in bondage to different sins. Let me give seven sample cases.

1.  **The Pharisee.** He was in bondage to self-righteousness. He
    thought he was free, and behold he was bound. He thanks God he is
    not as other men, and behold he is worse than other men, because of
    what he is not, and being proud of it (Luke 18:11).
2.  **Esau.** He was in bondage to sensual satisfaction (Genesis 25:32;
    Heb. 12:16). He did not care about the future or spiritual things so
    long as his present need was supplied, and his desire granted. He
    had enough when his appetites were met.
3.  **Balaam.** He was in bondage to the love of money. He loved the
    wages of unrighteousness. It was of little moment to him who
    suffered if only he could obtain his own ends (Jude 11; Numbers 22).
4.  **Demas.** He was in bondage to worldliness (2 Tim. 4:10). Love of
    the world fascinated Demas to his destruction. It was a wrecker’s
    light that lured him on to the rocks of error, where he made
    shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience.
5.  **Korah.** Korah and his followers were guilty ot rebellion against
    God in coveting the priesthood; hence, they were in bondage to pride
    (Numbers 16). Pride is self-assertion and self-will in opposition to
    God’s word and will. Pride is a hideous power to be under. It is a
    very octopus that will suck the life-blood out of any man, and lead
    him to eternal death.
6.  **Nadab and Abihu.** It seems that these sons of Aaron, being under
    the influence of strong drink, brought strange fire into the Lord’s
    presence, as after their death the priests were prohibited from
    drinking strong drink when in the service of the tabernacle (Lev.
    10:9). The sons of Aaron were in bondage to strong drink, hence,
    their rash action which brought such a terrible judgment upon them.
    How many there are who are in bondage to intemperance. It is a
    blight that kills everything that is bright, beautiful, noble, and
    moral.
7.  **Lord of Samaria.** The lord of Samaria was in bondage to unbelief.
    He did not believe that God could meet the need of Samaria. The
    consequence was, he was punished by death for his want of faith (2
    Kings 7:2, 19-20). Unbelief is a cloud that hides the sun from view.

There is only one Person who can free the one who is in bondage, and
that One is Christ.

# 40. Born of God

WHAT is the evidence that we are born of God? We have the question
answered in John’s first Epistle. Seven times we find the words “Born of
God” occurring.

1.  **Righteousness of life.** “Every one that doeth righteousness is
    born of Him” (1Jo. 2:29).
2.  **Not practising sin.** “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
    sin” (1Jo. 3:9).
3.  **New nature implanted.** “He cannot sin, because he is born of God”
    (1Jo. 3:9).
4.  **Loving one another.** “Every one that loveth is born of God” (1Jo.
    4:7).
5.  **Faith in Christ.** “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ,
    is born of God” (1Jo. 5:1).
6.  **Victory over the world.** “Whatsoever is born of God overcometh
    the world (1Jo. 5:4).
7.  **Kept by Christ.** “Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but He
    that was begotten of God keepeth him” (1Jo. 5:18, R.V.).

# 41. Bread of Life

**Bread is expressive of the Atonement of Christ, in the process it
undergoes.** From its birth, till it is consumed, the corn of wheat
preaches to us.

1.  **The corn of wheat has to die,** before it can bring forth more
    wheat. Christ uses this very fact as an illustration of the
    necessity of His death for us (John 12:24). He would have been for
    ever alone in His holiness and blessedness, if He had not died for
    us; and we should have been for ever alone in our sinfulness and
    misery.
2.  **When the corn is ripe it has to be cut down;** even so, when the
    fulness of time was come, Christ was cut off out of the land of the
    living (Isaiah 53:8); cut off by the justice of God in dying for our
    sins (Zech. 13:7); and cut off by death, that He might conquer the
    king of terrors, and overthrow him who had the power of death, which
    is the devil (Heb. 2:14).
3.  **Then the wheat has to be threshed.** How intensely Christ was
    maltreated. He gave His back to the smiters, and His cheeks to them
    that plucked off the hair (Isaiah 50:6). “The chastisement of our
    peace was upon Him” (Isaiah 53:5). How much Christ suffered at the
    hands of wicked men! We have only to go over the scenes that
    immediately precede His death for illustration on this point.
4.  **The corn has to be ground.** Whether we think of the corn being
    bruised between the mill-stones as used in the East (Isaiah 28:28),
    or think of the corn as it is ground in the modern machinery of
    to-day, we are reminded of the bruising of Christ. “He was bruised
    for our iniquities” (Isaiah 53:5). Who can analyze such expressions
    as “He was made sin for us” (2 Cor 5:21). “He was made a curse”
    (Gal. 3:13)? Who can weigh that soul agonizing cry of Christ, “My
    God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” Well might Luther sit for
    hours pondering that mysterious exclamation, and at last burst forth
    in the following words, “God, forsaken by God!”
5.  **When the flour has been made into loaves, it has to be baked.**
    The fire makes it into bread, so that we can eat it with pleasure.
    This reminds us of Christ, who has undergone the fire of God’s
    judgment for our sins. He passed through the fiery baptism of God’s
    wrath (Matt. 20:22), when He was condemned in our stead (Rom. 8:3,
    margin). It is because the fire has fed upon the God-appointed
    sacrifice that the coals from off the altar have a cleansing virtue,
    as is illustrated in the case of Isaiah, when the seraph applied the
    live coal to the unclean lips of the prophet, and said, “Thine
    iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged” (Isaiah 6:7).
6.  **When the bread is eaten, then the nutriment of the bread becomes
    part of the one who eats;** and when Christ is received by faith,
    then we possess Him, and He becomes the life of our being (John
    6:54).

\




# 42. Cain, the Man of Unbelief

As faith and obedience are synonymous, so are disobedience and unbelief.

1.  The man of unbelief **acts in his own way.** “The way of Cain” (Jude
    11) is Cain acting according to his own thought, which was in direct
    opposition to the Word of God. “There is a way that seemeth right
    unto man, but the end thereof is death” (Prov. 14:12; Isaiah 55:8).
2.  The man of unbelief is **rejected** (Gen. 4:5). Jehovah did not
    regard the offering of Cain. Abel’s offering was accepted, because
    fire from heaven fell upon it, which was a sign of its acceptance on
    behalf of the offerer, as may be gathered from Lev. 9:24; Judges
    6:21; 1 Kings 18:38; 1 Chron. 21:26, and 2 Chron. 7:1. On the other
    hand, when no fire fell, it was an evidence that the offering was
    not acceptable to God; hence, the offerer is rejected with his
    offering.
3.  The man of unbelief is **angry** (Gen. 4:5). When man is in the
    wrong, he often vents his spite in angry words and actions. The word
    “wroth” is translated “kindled” in Job 32:2-3; thus to be angry is
    to be consumed as with a fire, or a burning disease. The same term
    is rendered “fret” in Psalm 37:1, 7-8; Prov. 24:19. Beware of anger,
    especially anger against the Lord, as Jonah (Jonah 4:1, 4, 9), when
    the men of Nineveh repented; or, as in the case of Cain, when he was
    angry because his brother was accepted, and he rejected.
4.  The man of unbelief is **self-willed** (Gen. 4:7). When Cain had the
    opportunity to bring the offering that was pleasing, he refused to
    do so. The more correct rendering, undoubtedly, is not “sin,” but a
    “sin-offering croucheth at the door.” The Preacher’s Homiletical
    Commentary paraphrases the verse as follows:―“A sin-offering is
    crouching at the door of thy brother’s fold, though, in order to do
    well, thou must needs own thyself a sinner, and be indebted to thy
    brother for a sin-offering out of his fold; yet this will not
    destroy thy rights as firstborn, notwithstanding to thee shall be
    his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. Let not pride, therefore,
    deter thee from this better-this only proper-way. Let no obstinacy,
    no groundless fears, keep thee from thus doing well.”
5.  The man of unbelief is an **unhappy** man. With sullen looks Cain
    broods over his rejection. “His countenance fell,” is the Divine
    comment, and, in addition, the Divine question, “Why is thy
    countenance fallen?” The word “fell” is translated “rot” in Numbers
    5:21. As a disease will rot away the vital part of the human body,
    and will show itself in the face of its victim; so pride was a
    cancer that was eating out the love that Cain should have had for
    his brother, which showed itself in his unhappy looks.
6.  The man of unbelief is **hateful** (Gen. 4:8; 1 John 3:12). The Holy
    Spirit takes the case of Cain hating and slaying his brother, as an
    example of the hatred the world has for the Christian.
7.  The man of unbelief is **punished** (Gen. 4:11-13). As unbelief is
    the mother of all sin, so unbelief is the harbinger of coming wrath.
    They who live in unbelief are laying up wrath against the day of
    wrath.

# 43. Caleb

THERE are seven things that characterise Caleb.

1.  He was a **thorough believer,** for he followed the Lord fully (Num.
    14:24).
2.  He was a **courageous witness,** for he would not listen to the
    popular voice (Num. 13:30).
3.  He was a **separated saint,** for he was of “another spirit” than
    the others (Num. 14:24).
4.  He was a **prompt actor.** “Let us go up at once and possess the
    land,” is his cry (Num. 13:30).
5.  He was a **confident man.** “We are well able to overcome,” is his
    unhesitating cry (Num. 13:30).
6.  He was a **persecuted servant.** The people are not willing to
    hearken to Joshua and Caleb, but want to stone them (Num. 14:10).
7.  He was a **rewarded disciple** (Num. 14:24; Num. 32:11-12), for he
    was privileged to see, enter, and enjoy the land of promise (Jos.
    14).

# 44. Caleb, or Whole-Heartedness

SEVEN times we are told that Caleb wholly followed the Lord, or more
correctly, the term “*wholly*” is found in association with Caleb seven
times. Once the same Hebrew word is rendered “*fully*” (Num. 14:24).

It is of interest to know that the word “*wholly*” is the same as is
rendered “*consecrate*” in the setting apart of Aaron and his sons for
the priesthood (Ex. 28:41; 29:9). The word means, to be full, and is
again and again translated “*full*” in the Psalms (Ps. 33:5; 65:9;
104:24; 119:64).

1.  The **essential** to wholly following the Lord. In Deut. 1:36, we
    read that Caleb “wholly followed the Lord,” or, as the margin gives
    it, “fulfilled to go after the Lord.” The words seem to indicate his
    willingness to follow the Lord. The main thing in consecration is,
    that the will is adjusted to the will of God, as the clock is
    adjusted to the sun for correctness of time. Christ says, “if any
    man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether
    it be of God” (John 7:17 R.V.). If the will is right the walk will
    be right too, for what the regulator is to the watch, so the will is
    to the life.
2.  The **meaning** of wholly following the Lord. In Num. 14:24, the
    Lord says, “Caleb . . . . followed me fully,” or as Young translates
    the words, “he is fully after Me.” To be fully after the Lord
    signifies that we are so close to Him that there is not anything
    between Him and us, and that we seek to act like Him in all things,
    in that we carry out His word in every particular.
3.  Caleb is seen in **contrast** to those who did not wholly follow the
    Lord (Num. 32:11). One reason why Christ was hated, was because the
    holy light of His pure life showed up the unholy lives of His
    enemies, and made them to stand out in unmistakable contrast. When
    our lives are like the beautiful rainbow, it will cause those who
    are like the dark cloud to be seen in vivid contrast.
4.  The Lord delights to commend the **thoroughness** of
    wholeheartedness. Num. 32:12, is one of the many places where Caleb
    is commended for wholly following the Lord. God delights in all men
    with the *love of compassion* (John 3:16), but it is only those
    whose hearts and lives are right with Him that He can delight in
    with the *love of complacency* (Col. 1:10). He ever delights to
    commend what He can. The widow’s mite (Luke 21:3); the cup of cold
    water (Mark 9:41); the Samaritan’s kindness (Luke 10:37); the pot of
    ointment (John 12:7); the woman’s tears (Luke 7:44); the faith of
    the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 1:8); and the seven traits of character
    in the Ephesian saints (Rev. 2:2-3), are a few things He commends.
5.  The **courage** of whole-heartedness (Joshua 14:8). As Caleb says,
    the rest of those, excepting Joshua, who went to spy the land, were
    entirely over-awed by what they saw, but not so Caleb. He knew the
    Lord, and was fully confident of His ability to give the entire
    victory. Faith reckons not on outward appearances, but looks at
    matters through the telescope of God’s truth. Faint heart, want of
    courage, and unbelief are sure to see the lions in the way, as
    Timorous and Mistrust in *Pilgrim’s Progress* did, but they do not
    see, as Christian did, that the lions are chained.
6.  The **possession** of whole-heartedness (Joshua 14:9). Caleb had
    been promised that he should see the land of Canaan, and now he
    claims the fulfilment of the inheritance that had been promised him.
    We are not promised an earthly inheritance as a reward of faith, but
    we have an incorruptible inheritance (1 Peter 1:4), which we may
    enjoy now in some measure (Eph. 1:3), as we have already received
    the earnest (Eph. 1:13-14).
7.  The **reward** of whole-heartedness (Joshua 14:14). Hebron became
    the reward of Caleb’s faithfulness. Hebron means “fellowship.”
    Fellowship with Christ is the reward of walking in the light of His
    presence now (1 John 1:7), and fellowship with Him in a peculiar
    sense, in the eternity to come, is the reward of faithfulness (Rev.
    3:4).

# 45. Caleb's Reward

JOSHUA 14:5-14

THE men of the Bible have generally one trait in their character which
is more prominent than another. Moses is the man of meekness; Abraham,
the man of separation; David, the man of courage; Joseph, the man of
purity; John, the man of love; Peter, the man of zeal; and Caleb, the
man of faith.

I shall call attention to a sevenfold aspect of faith, as brought out in
Caleb.

1.  **Claim of Faith** (Jos. 14:6). Faith’s claim is always based on
    God’s promise. “The thing the Lord said concerning me,” is ever the
    language of faith. Faith has nothing to say about itself, other than
    “The Lord says.” When men claim that which God has not promised, it
    is presumption, and not faith.
    -   “Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees,
    -   And looks to God alone.
    -   Laughs at impossibilities.
    -   And cries ’It shall be done.’”

2.  **Consecration of Faith** (Jos. 14:8). The word “*consecrate*” in
    Exodus 28:41, and Exodus 29:9, is the same as we have rendered
    “*wholly*” in describing Caleb’s obedience. Trapp remarks, “The
    Hebrew signifies ’I fulfilled after the Lord.’ A metaphor taken from
    a ship under sail carried strongly with the wind, as if it feared
    neither rocks nor sands. Thus he commended himself, that none might
    tax him with injustice or ambition for that which he now required
    from Joshua.” Caleb’s devotion in following the Lord fully is noted
    in Deut. 1:36; Num. 14:24; 32:11; Jos. 14:8-9, 14. Faith’s
    consecration is summed up in one word—”Obedience.” Consecration on
    the Godward side of it, is the indwelling presence of Christ acting
    within to reproduce His own behaviour in the life (Gal. 2:20); and
    on the manward side, consecration is the response of the believer to
    the word of God’s grace in simple, whole-hearted obedience (1 Peter
    1:14-21).
3.  **Confession of Faith** (Jos. 14:10). “The Lord hath kept me,” is
    ever the glad confession of faith. “No might” (2 Chron. 20:12) is
    the plea of faith in prayer for the Lord’s protection. Caleb had
    kept himself in the Lord’s keeping by his whole-heartedness, and
    now, as a consequence, he can proclaim what the Lord had done for
    him. As the electricity runs along the wire that is connected with
    the battery, so the Lord’s keeping grace is found along the line of
    faith (1 Peter 1:5), which faith shows itself in obedience; and when
    we have experienced the keeping power of God’s grace, then we can
    bear our testimony to His faithfulness, and not otherwise.
4.  **Courage of Faith** (Jos. 14:11). Caleb feels that he is still able
    to go to war, for his strength, like that of Moses (Deut. 34:7), was
    not abated. His health of soul (3 John 2) had conduced to
    healthiness of body. Godliness is profitable from this standpoint (1
    Tim. 4:8). The secret of courage in the Christian life for warfare
    and witnessing is found in walking with the Lord. If we can look up
    into the face of God with an uncondemning heart (1 John 3:20-21),
    then we shall be able to look into the faces of men in faithful
    testimony (Acts 4:13).
5.  **Company of Faith** (Jos. 14:12). The presence of Jehovah was
    Caleb’s joy. He felt he could do anything, be anything, and go
    anywhere, if only the Lord was with him. If the Lord is with us,
    victory is sure (1 Sam. 14:6), our feet are kept from slipping
    (Psalm 18:32-33), our faith is bold (Psalm 27:1-3), our soul is
    comforted (Psalm 23:4), and we are encouraged (Phil. 4:13).
6.  **Confidence of Faith.** “I shall be able to drive them out, as the
    Lord said” (Jos. 14:12). Caleb had the Divine promise of victory
    over his enemies (Josh. 3:10), and therefore he was confident of
    success. The difference between faith and presumption is this:
    presumption acts on its own authority, but faith always depends on
    “Thus saith the Lord” (Heb. 11:29). Self-confidence is man acting
    without God, but faith-confidence upon the Lord (1 Sam. 17:45-46).
7.  **Compensation of Faith** (Jos. 14:13-14). Caleb is rewarded because
    of his faithfulness. Hebron becomes his inheritance. Hebron means
    fellowship. Fellowship with the Lord is the reward of walking with
    the Lord now (1 Cor. 1:9), and, in the hereafter, a crown. An
    “incorruptible crown” for diligently running the race (1 Cor. 9:25),
    a “crown of life” for endurance (James 1:12), a “crown of
    righteousness” for those who love Christ’s appearing (2 Tim. 4:8), a
    “crown of rejoicing” for those who bring others to Christ (1 Thess.
    2:19), and a “crown of glory” for faithful service (1 Peter 5:4).

# 46. Call of Abram

GENESIS 12:1-9

IF we take in the last two verses of Gen. 11, we find that Abram is
connected with three places, namely, “Ur,” “Haran,” and “Canaan.” “Ur,”
as associated with Abram in his idolatry; “Haran,” as connected with
Abram’s partial obedience; and “Canaan,” as identified with Abram’s
communion with God.

**Ur.** Ur means in Hebrew “Light,” and was probably so called because
of the idolatrous custom of fire worship among the Persians. Very
little, if anything, is known of the history of “Ur,” other than it was
in Chaldea, as it is specially designated “Ur of the Chaldees,” but of
this we are plainly told, that it was associated with idolatrous
worship, for the ancestors of Abram are said to have “dwelt beyond the
river,” the river Euphrates, and “served other gods” (Joshua 24:2,
R.V.). It was from this place that the Lord called Abram. There are
several expressions which bring out what God did for Abram in bringing
him out of idolatry, which illustrate what God does for the believer in
Christ.

1.  God **chose** Ahram. “The Lord thy God chose Abram” (Neh. 9:7). As
    God chose Abram to be for Himself, so He has chosen the believer in
    Christ (Eph. 1:4).
2.  God **called** Abram. “By faith Abraham, when he was called,” &c.
    (Hebrews 11:8). As God called Abram out of idolatry, so He has
    called the believer out of the darkness of sin, into the life, light
    and liberty of the Gospel (1 Peter 2:9).
3.  God **commanded** Abram. “The Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out
    of thy country,” &c. (Gen. 12:1). As God commanded Abram to be
    separated from his old surroundings and relations, so He directs the
    believer not to be yoked with unbelievers and the world (2 Cor.
    6:14-18).
4.  God **taking** Abram. “I took your father Abraham,” &c. (Joshua
    24:3). As God took Abram from the old position and condition that he
    was in, so He has taken the believer from the course of this wicked
    age, and the death of sin, and made him to be seated with Christ in
    heavenly places (Eph. 2:1-6).
5.  God **bringing** Abram. “I am the Lord that brought thee out” (Gen.
    15:7; Neh. 9:7). God’s action to Abram was not only a command to
    “come out” of Ur, not only an exhibition of His power in taking him
    out, but a gracious act in leading him, as the mother leads her
    child out of danger. In like manner the Lord has dealt with us (Col.
    1:13).
6.  God **redeemed** Abram. “The Lord, who redeemed Abraham” (Isaiah
    29:22). All the Old Testament saints (Rom. 3:24-25, R.V.), as well
    as ourselves (Eph. 1:7), owe their redemption to the blood of Christ
    (1 Peter 1:18-19). To redeem, means to set at liberty by virtue of a
    price paid.
7.  Abram **obeyed** God (Heb. 11:8). Obedience was a proof of his
    election, and ours (2 Peter 1:10).

# 47. Chain of Good Things

THE believer in Christ ever says, with the Psalmist, “I have no good
beyond Thee” (Psalm 16:2, R.V.).

1.  In ourselves there is no good thing (Rom. 7:18).
2.  But the good that has been planted within us (2 Tim. 1:14).
3.  Which is the outcome of the good work of the Lord (Phil. 1:6).
4.  Is productive of good works (Eph. 2:10).
5.  So that by His grace we have a good conscience (1 Tim. 1:19).
6.  And fight a good warfare (1 Tim. 6:12).
7.  Thus are we good soldiers of Jesus Christ (2 Tim. 2:3).

# 48. Chastisement

THE purposes of chastisement are many, but they may be classified under
the following seven heads:

1.  **Illuminative.** To discover faults and failings. “I speak not with
    your children which have not known, and which have not seen the
    chastisement” (Deut. 11:2).
2.  **Preventative.** To keep from failure and self exaltation. “God
    hath seen mine affliction, and the labour of my hands, and rebuked
    (chastened) thee yesternight” (Gen. 31:42).
3.  **Instructive.** To cause us to know His way and will. “The prophecy
    his mother taught him” (Prov. 31:1).
4.  **Curative.** To prevent us from failing, where we have failed
    before. “Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of
    silver…thus she was reproved” (Gen. 20:16).
5.  **Corrective.** To drive away that which is not helpful.
    “Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; but the rod of
    correction shall drive it far from him” (Prov. 22:15).
6.  **Illustrative.** To let others see the divine grace and patience
    exemplified in us. “Happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore
    despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty” (Job 5:17).
7.  **Punitive.** To punish for misdeed or disobedience. “To deliver
    such an one unto Satan” (1 Cor. 5:5).



# 49. Cherubim, Illustrative of the Believer's Union with Christ

WE will take, as illustrating the believer’s union with Christ, the
cherubim on the veil, the covering, in the mercy-seat, and in the
throne.

1.  **On the veil** (Ex. 36:35). “The veil of the temple was rent in the
    midst” (Luke 23:45); and in this we see that, in the person of our
    Representative, we have borne the punishment due to sin, satisfied
    Divine justice, and hence we are said to be baptised into His death
    (Rom. 6:3).
2.  **On the covering of twined linen, &c.** (Ex. 36:8). This covering
    was the ceiling of the tabernacle, and when the priest went in, he
    would see the cherubim inwrought on the beautiful covering. As it
    was above, so, in a spiritual sense, we are risen in and made to sit
    with Christ in heavenly places; or, as we are told in another place,
    “Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are *risen with Him*,
    through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from
    the dead” (Col. 2:12).
3.  **In the mercy-seat.** The cherubim were made out of the same piece
    of gold as the mercy-seat, as we read in Ex. 25:19: “And make one
    cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end; even
    of *the matter of the mercy-seat* (margin) shall ye make the
    cherubim on the two ends thereof.” This reminds us that “both He
    that sanctifieth and they which are sanctified are one;” that we are
    made partakers of the Divine nature; that we are accepted, blest,
    risen, and seated in the heavenlies in the person of our Lord.
4.  **In the throne** (Rev. 4:6, and 5:6, R.V.). We cannot do better
    than quote the words of another on this point: “These living ones
    not only stand before the throne and serve, as redeemed unto God by
    the blood of the Lamb; they are one with the Lamb in the midst of
    the throne, ’members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones,’
    raised up together and made to sit together in Him and with Him in
    the heavens. For when God ’raised Him up from the dead, and set Him
    on His own right hand in the heavenlies,’ He ’gave Him to be Head
    over all things to the Church, which is His body, the fulness of Him
    that filleth all in all.’”

# 50. Children of God

1.  WE are children of God **instrumentally**, by faith in Christ. “Ye
    are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:26).
2.  We are children of God by **birth**, as to our right. “As many as
    received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God” (John
    1:12-13).
3.  We are children of God by **acknowledgment**, for He acknowledges us
    as such. “We should be called children of God, and such we are” (1
    John 3:1, R.V.).
4.  We are children of God by **adoption**, as to our security. “Having
    predestinated us unto the adoption of children” (Eph. 1:5).
5.  We are children of God **consciously**, because He, by the Spirit in
    the Word, tells us so. “Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
    Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father” (Galatians
    4:6).
6.  We are children of God **manifestly** before the world, as we walk
    in practical obedience to Him. “As obedient children, not fashioning
    yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance” (1 Peter
    1:14-17).
7.  We are children of God in **reality**, as we are led by the Spirit.
    “As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God”
    (Rom. 8:14).

# 51. Cleaving to Christ

ACTS 11:23

THE following seven ways will indicate how we can cleave to Christ:―

1.  By prayerful dependence upon Him (Phil. 4:6).
2.  By being taught by Him (Matt. 11:29).
3.  By ready response to His word (John 14:21).
4.  By whole-hearted surrender to Him (Rom. 12:1).
5.  By separation from the ungodly (2 Cor. 6:17).
6.  By living a life of faith upon Him (Gal. 2:20).
7.  By waiting for Him (1 Thess. 1:10).


# 52. Christ's Ability

1.  HE is **able to establish** us according to the Gospel. “That is
    *able* to stablish you according to my gospel” (Rom. 16:25).
2.  He is **able to supply** our every conceivable and inconceivable
    need. “That is *able* to do exceeding abundantly above all that we
    ask or think” (Eph. 3:20).
3.  He is **able to succour** the tempted under every condition of
    temptation. “He is *able* to succour them that are tempted” (Hebrews
    2:18).
4.  He is **able to save** to the uttermost. “Wherefore He is *able*
    also to save them to the uttermost” (Heb. 7:25).
5.  He is **able to guard** from stumbling. “That is *able* to guard you
    from stumbling” (Jude 24, R.V.).
6.  He is **able to make** us sufficient in service. “Who also made us
    *sufficient* as ministers of a new covenant” (2 Cor. 3:6, R.V.).
7.  He is **able to subject** all things to Himself. “He is *able* even
    to subdue all things unto Himself” (Phil. 3:21).

# 53. Christ and the Children

MATTHEW 18:1-14

“IT is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little
ones should perish” (Matt. 18:14).

The expression, “The kingdom of heaven,” is far more comprehensive than
“The Church of God.” There are many that are in the kingdom who are not
in the Church, while all who are in the Church are in the kingdom. The
Church has to do with heavenly things (Eph. 2:6; Phil. 3:20). The
kingdom has to do with earthly things (Matt. 10:7). The Church is made
up of those who are the members of Christ’s body (Eph. 1:23). The
kingdom is composed of those who *profess* to be the followers of
Christ.

1.  **Conversion is the door of the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:3). Conversion
    means a turning round. In the Biblical sense conversion means a
    turning to God, which necessitates a turning from that which has
    occupied His place before (1 Thess. 1:9). This is far more than a
    change of opinion or religious views. “God forbid that I should
    change my religion!” said an ignorant old woman, when she was
    exhorted to leave her self-righteousness and to believe in Christ.
    “You object to change your religion,” said the friend who was
    speaking to her, “but has your religion changed you?”
2.  **Humility is the law of the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:4). As there are
    certain great laws in the realm of nature which govern this earth,
    such as the law of gravitation, so there are certain laws in the
    kingdom of heaven, and chiefest among them is humility. Humility is
    the grace that holds all the other graces together. “The Greek word
    imports that humility is the ribbon or string that ties together all
    those precious pearls, the rest of the graces. If this string breaks
    they are all scattered.” Augustine was once asked, “What is the
    first article in the Christian religion?” and he replied,
    “Humility.” “What is the second?” “Humility.” “And what is the
    third?” And again he answered, “Humility.” Humility is the
    *evidence* that we have learnt of Christ (Matt. 11:29). Humility is
    the *attitude* to receive more grace (Jas. 4:6). Humility is the
    *garment* that the Lord loves to see us wear (1 Peter 5:5). Humility
    is the *place* where God can reach us to exalt us (Luke 18:14).
3.  **Doing good to others is the evidence of being in the Kingdom**
    (Matt. 18:5). To receive one of the little ones, is to receive
    Christ Himself; that is, anything that is done for Christ’s sake to
    one of the little ones, Christ reckons it as being done to Himself.
    What an incentive this should be to do good to others! For there is
    nothing done as to the Lord, which escapes His notice. A cup of cold
    water given (Matt. 10:42), a prophet received (Matt. 10:41), a
    garment made (Acts 9:39), alms given (Acts 10:4), a sick one visited
    (Matt. 25:36), a hungry one supplied (Matt. 25:35), and an offering
    sent (Phil. 4:18), will always be noted by Christ, and shall surely
    be rewarded.
4.  **Offences, the excluder from the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:6-10). The
    word rendered “*offence*” in Matt. 18:7, is translated “*fall*” in
    Romans 14:13, and “stumbling-block” in Rev. 2:14. Its meaning is
    evident if we take the latter Scripture. As Balaam taught Balak to
    cast a stumbling-block in the way of Israel (Num. 25), in causing
    them to fall by the sin into which he led them, so to cast an
    offence in the way of a child is to cause it to sin, and he who does
    so has the “woe” of Christ resting upon him.
5.  **Angelic ministry, the privilege of the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:10).
    Children are the special regard of heaven, in that they have the
    angels to watch over them, and to care for them, who evidently give
    a report of all that men do in relation to them.
6.  **Salvation, the purport of the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:11-13). Even the
    children are “lost,” hence, the needs be, that the Son of Man should
    come and save them. All have sinned (Rom. 3:23), all have gone
    astray (Isaiah 53:6), all are under sin (Gal. 3:22), and, therefore,
    all are lost; but God sent His Son to save (John 3:17), Christ has
    come to save (1 Tim. 1:15), He died to bring us to God (1 Pet.
    3:18), He has made peace by the blood of His cross (Col. 1:20), and
    receiving Christ as our Saviour we are “saved” (Eph. 2:5), made new
    creatures in Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 5:17), and become the children of
    God (John 1:12).\
     The word “*save*,” in Matt. 18:11, is translated “*healed*” in Mark
    5:23; “*made whole*,” in Mark 5:34; “*do well*,” in John 11:12; and
    “*preserve*” in 2 Tim. 4:18. Sin is a disease; therefore, Christ
    heals us. Sin has broken us; therefore, Christ makes us whole by
    re-making us. Sin made us do ill; therefore, Christ makes us do
    well. Sin made us perverse in self-doing, Christ preserves us by His
    doing.
7.  **Love is the basis of the Kingdom** (Matt. 18:14). God’s will is
    our welfare. He could never desire that any should perish. This is
    plainly stated by Christ in John 3:16. But, on the other hand, there
    is a possibility of even one of the little ones perishing, if he
    lives in the ways of sin and self. Love’s provision for all is
    salvation; well for all if they accept the provision.

# 54. Christ Above the Believer

1.  As the **Finisher** of His work on our behalf. “After He had offered
    one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down” (Heb. 10:12).
2.  As the **Conqueror** over His and our enemies. “He might destroy
    him” (Heb. 2:14).
3.  As our **High Priest**, to represent. “To appear in the presence of
    God for us” (Heb. 9:24).
4.  As our **Advocate**, to plead. “We have an Advocate” (1 John 2:1).
5.  As the **Firstfruits** of the harvest. “Christ the Firstfruits” (1
    Cor. 15:23).
6.  As the **Sun** to warm. “The Lord God is a Sun” (Ps. 84:11).
7.  As the **Shield**, to protect. “I am thy Shield” (Gen. 15:1).

# 55. Christ as the Opener and Shutter

“HE that openeth, and no man shutteth” (Rev. 3:7).

1.  Christ, as the **Convincer of sins, opens our eyes to see
    ourselves.** “I the Lord have called Thee (Christ) in righteousness,
    and will hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee for a
    covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to *open the
    blind eyes*” (Isaiah 42:6-7).
2.  **Christ as the Deliverer from sin: He opened the prison-house of
    sin and gave us liberty.** The first time that Christ preached in
    the Synagogue at Nazareth, He opened the book or scroll of the
    Scriptures, and turned to the place having reference to Himself as
    the Deliverer, and said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because
    He hath anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent
    Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
    captives” (Luke 4:18). As He delivered Israel out of the hand of
    Pharaoh, so He has delivered us out of the power of the god of this
    world. As He delivered Peter out of prison, so He has delivered us
    out of the prison-house of sin, and brought us into the glorious
    liberty of the Gospel.
3.  **He opens the heart to receive Himself as the possessor.** We read
    in Acts 16:14, how He opened Lydia’s heart. Again our Lord says,
    “Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and
    open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him, and he with
    Me” (Rev. 3:20).
4.  **He opens our understanding by opening the Scriptures to us, as the
    Teacher.** When Christ appeared to His disciples after His
    resurrection, in the upper room, we read that “He opened their
    understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.” Also the
    confession of the two disciples who were on their way to Emmaus was,
    “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the
    way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?” (Luke 24:32, 45).
5.  **He has opened the sources of heaven for our supply.** “He opened
    the rock and the waters gushed out” (Psalm 105:41); “Thou openest
    Thy hand, they are filled with good” (Psalm 104:28).

# 56. Christ as the Possessor of the Key of David

“HE that hath the key of David. He that openeth, and no man shutteth;
and shutteth, and no man openeth” (Rev. 3:7).

“The Key of David.” The key represents power, authority, office.

**A person who has the key can unlock the door, and thus reveal what is
in the room.** Christ has power to show what sin has done. Sin is like
Ehud slaying Eglon, king of Moab; after Ehud had slain the king, he shut
the door and escaped (Judges 3:23); sin has slain us, and naturally we
are dead in trespasses and sins.

**Christ is the Revealer of the Father.** He had to say to the lawyers
when here on earth, “Ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered
not in yourselves, and them that were entering in, ye hindered.” But it
was not, and is not so with Christ. He was faithful in speaking out the
Father’s words, and instead of hindering, He has laid down His life for
us, and opened up a new and living way into the Father’s presence.

**A person who has the key has the power to admit into the house or to
let out.** Christ says, “I have the keys of hell (hades) and the grave”
(Rev. 1:18). Satan seems to have had the keys before Christ died. We
have a picture given to us of the state of things in Luke 11:21-22.
Satan had the keys-the authority over the unseen world-before Christ
came, but Christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil.

**A person who has the key of the house has authority over the house,
and hence a right to enter into all the rooms.** Christ has authority
over His Church, for we are all His house.

There are two words rendered “power” in the New Testament, one meaning
strength, and the other authority.

*In reference to the past*. “I have power (authority) to lay it (life)
down, and I have power (authority) to take it again. This commandment
have I received from My Father.” Christ was sent by the Father to die.
He had His authority from His Father for all that He did; hence when
Pilate boasted of the authority he had, and said to Him, “Knowest thou
not that I have power (authority) to crucify Thee, and have power
(authority) to release Thee?” Christ replied, “Thou couldest have no
power (authority) at all against Me except it were given thee from
above” (John 19:10-11).

*In reference to the present*. Christ is the Head of all principality
and authority (Col. 2:10), and because He is such, He has authority to
make those who believe in Him children of God, for “As many as received
Him, to them gave He power (authority) to become the children of God”
(John 1:12). Yea, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to
Him, as He says, “All power (authority) is given unto Me in heaven and
on earth” (Matt. 28:18), and that was the reason He gave His disciples
for sending them forth to preach the Gospel and make disciples.

*In reference to the future*. Christ having the key of David, has
reference to the fact: that He is yet to reign over the House of David
(see Psalm 132:11; Acts 2:30; Isaiah 9:6-7; Ezek. 34:23-24; 37:24-25;
Luke 1:32-33). Christ shall literally stand upon the Mount of Olives,
overcome the enemies of Israel, gather out everything that offends, and
reign over this earth one thousand years.
# 57. Christ as the Son of Man

A SEVENFOLD view given to us of Christ as the Son of Man.

1.  As the Son of Man He is seen in His **suffering** (Matthew 17:12,
    22; 20:18-19; 26:2, 24, 45).
2.  In His **poverty** (Matt. 8:20).
3.  In His **authority** (Matt. 9:6; 12:8; Matt. 13:41; Matt. 16:13).
4.  In His **work** (Matt. 13:37; Matt. 18:11).
5.  In His **death** (Matt. 12:40).
6.  In His **resurrection** (Matt. 17:9).
7.  In His **coming glory** (Matt. 16:27-28; Matt. 19:28; Matt. 24:27,
    30, 37, 44; Matt. 25:13, 31; Matt. 26:64).

When Christ is spoken of as the “Son of Man” it is always in relation to
the earth. He is never once said to be such in the epistles in relation
to the Church, for the Church has to do with heaven, and not earth. Not
once in the epistles is He said to be the Son of Man. Once He is said to
be the Son of Man in the Acts (Acts 7:56), and twice in the Revelation
(Rev. 1:13; 14:14).
# 58. Christ Before the Believer

1.  As the **Object** of faith. “Looking unto Jesus the Author and
    Finisher of our faith” (Heb. 12:2).
2.  As the **Light**, to direct. “He that followeth Me shall not walk in
    darkness” (John 8:12).
3.  As the **Lord**, to obey. “If I then, your Lord and Master, have
    washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet” (John
    13:14)·
4.  As the **Shepherd**, to follow. “My sheep hear My voice and I know
    them and they follow Me” (John 10:27).

# 63. Christ's Glory

JOHN 2:11

As the first ray of the morning sun is the harbinger of the sunshine of
the day, so this first miracle was the forerunner of the many wondrous
deeds that Christ was about to perform.

There are many rays in the sun of Christ’s glory:―

1.  The **moral** glory of His **life** proclaims the **spotlessness**
    of His **holiness** (John 1:14).
2.  The **majestic** glory of His **person** speaks forth the
    **excellence** of His **worth** (2 Peter 1:17).
3.  The **mysterious** glory of His **Deity** tells out the **wonder**
    of His **Godhead** (Psalm 24:7, 10; Heb. 1:3).
4.  The **munificent** glory of His **grace** reminds us of the
    **greatness** of His **mercy** (Eph. 1:6).
5.  The **many-sided** glory of His **truth** declares the
    **immutability** of its **infallibility** (Psalm 108:4-5).
6.  The **marvellous** glory of His **Gospel** tells out the
    **sufficiency** of His **atonement** (2 Cor. 4:6).
7.  The **mighty** glory of His **miracles** speaks of the **strength**
    of His **power** (Eph. 3:16, 19).

# 64. Christ in a Sevenfold Character

CHRIST is seen in seven characters in Luke 2:25-34.

1.  **Consolation of Israel** (Luke 2:25). Christ in this character is
    One who is alongside to encourage and comfort.\
     An old Christian, as he was lying on what proved to be his
    deathbed, said
    -   “My soul most surely prizes
    -   The sin atoning Lamb;
    -   Thence all my hope arises,
    -   Unworthy though I am.”

2.  **Lord’s Christ** (Luke 2:26). Jesus as the “Christ” signifies God’s
    Anointed (John 1:41, margin). Jesus being anointed with the Holy
    Spirit was the evidence that He was the Sent of God (Acts 10:38),
    and the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit (John 1:32-33).
3.  **Jesus** (Luke 2:27). The name “Jesus” means “Saviour,” and is
    always associated with Him in His humiliation, as is illustrated in
    His being circumcised. Godet says upon the presentation of Christ in
    the Temple, “After the circumcision there were two other rites to
    observe. One concerned the mother. Levitically unclean for eight
    days after the birth of a son, and for fourteen days after that of a
    daughter, the Israelitish mother, after a seclusion of thirty-three
    days in the first case, and of double this time in the second, had
    to offer in the Temple a sacrifice of purification (Lev. 12). The
    other rite had reference to the child; when it was the firstborn it
    had to be redeemed by a sum of money from consecration to the
    service of God and the sanctuary. In fact, the tribe of Levi had
    been chosen for this office simply to take the place of the
    firstborn males of all the families of Israel; and in order to keep
    alive a feeling of His rights in the hearts of the people, God had
    fixed a ransom to be paid for every firstborn male. It was five
    shekels, or, reckoning the shekel at 2s. 4d., nearly 12s. (Ex. 13:2;
    Num. 8:16; 18:15). Luke 2:22 and 23 refer to the ransom of the
    child, 24 to Mary’s sacrifice.
4.  **Salvation** (Luke 2:30). Salvation is here personified. It is well
    to let all our blessings resolve themselves into Christ, as He
    Himself said when He went into the house of Zaccheus, “To-day is
    salvation come to thy house” (Luke 19:9).
5.  **Light** (Luke 2:32). He is Light to discover evil *to* us: He is
    Light to remove the consequence of evil *from* us, through cleansing
    by His blood; and He is Light in showing us the path in which to
    walk.
6.  **Glory of Thy people Israel** (Luke 2:32). Israel, alas! would have
    none of Him; hence they are wanting in glory, but when they shall
    look upon Him whom they have pierced, and receive Him as their
    Messiah, then Christ shall be their glory indeed.
7.  **Sign** (Luke 2:34). Christ is the Rise or Fall of every being.
    They who speak against Him shall find He is opposed to them, and a
    Sign of their eternal condemnation.

# 65. Christ in Isaiah 52 and 53

    52:13).

19. **The Seeming Felon.** “He made His grave with the wicked” (Isa.
    53:9).
20. **The Holy Lord.** “He had done no violence, neither was any deceit
    in His mouth” (Isa. 53:9).
21. **The Sin-offering.** “Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin”
    (Isa. 53:10).
22. **The Prosperous Servant.** “And the pleasure of the Lord shall
    prosper in His hand” (Isa. 53:10).
23. **The Satisfied Redeemer.** “He shall see of the travail of His
    soul, and be satisfied” (Isa. 53:11).
24. **The Righteous Mediator.** “My righteous Servant shall justify
    many” (Isa. 53:11).
25. **The Rewarded Jesus.** “Therefore will I divide Him a portion with
    the great” (Isa. 53:12).
26. **The Conquering Hero.** “He shall divide the spoil with the strong”
    (Isa. 53:12).
27. **The Drink Offering.** “He hath poured out His soul unto death”
    (Isa. 53:12).
28. **The Interceding Priest.** “Made intercession for the
    transgressors” (Isa. 53:12).

# 66. “Christ Jesus” in Philippians

1.  “**Saints** in *Christ Jesus*” (Phl. 1:1). Our standing.
2.  “Let this **mind** be in you which was also in *Christ Jesus*” (Phl.
    2:5).
3.  Our example.
4.  “**Rejoice** in *Christ Jesus*” (Phl. 3:3). Our rejoicing.
5.  “**Apprehended** of *Christ Jesus*” (Phl. 3:12). Our aim.
6.  “**High calling** of God in *Christ Jesus*” (Phl. 3:14). Our goal.
7.  “**Peace** of God keep your hearts and minds through *Christ Jesus*”
    (Phl. 4:7). Our rest.
8.  **Need** supplied according to God’s “riches in glory by *Christ
    Jesus*” (Phl. 4:19). Our supply.

# 67. Christ Needs Us

Christ needs His people, now in this life, to accomplish His purposes.

He needs our *lips* to preach His Gospel, as He told His disciples
(Matt. 28:19).

He needs our *hearts* to perfume with His presence (Eph. 3:17), as He
needed the tabernacle of old (Ex. 25:8).

He needs our *company* for fellowship, as may be gathered from His talk
and walk with the two disciples who were journeying to Emmaus (Luke
24:15).

He needs our *ear* to reveal to us. His secrets, as He did in the case
of Abram regarding Sodom (Gen. 18:17).

He needs our *hands* to minister to the needs of others, as may be
gathered from Matt. 25:34-37.

He needs our *love* to gladden Him, as is illustrated in His regard and
pleasure in Mary anointing Him with the precious ointment (John 12:3-7).

He needs our *obedience* to glorify Him, as is shown in His commendation
of Job to the devil (Job 1:8).

He needs our *wills*, to mould them, as is plainly expressed in His
invitation to take His yoke upon us (Matt. 11:29).

He needs our *talents* to speak for Him, as is represented in His
appreciation of the workmen of the tabernacle (Ex. 31:2-3).

He needs our *life* to reproduce His own, as it may be observed from the
apostle’s words in Gal. 2:20.

He needs our *praise* to honour Him, as He clearly states in His words
to the thankful Samaritan leper (Luke 17:17).

He needs our *whole being*, spirit, soul, and body, to sanctify, that
like the temple of old, “every whit may utter His glory” (Psalm 29:9,
M.).

**Our need is met, as we meet the need of Christ.** The ass’s colt has
been honoured for all time in carrying Christ into Jerusalem. In like
manner, those who honour God are honoured by Him (Prov. 4:8); those who
give to God, receive from God (Luke 6:38); those who yield to God, He
yields Himself to them (Rom. 6:13-14); those who obey God, have the
power of God (Acts 5:32); and those who endure for God have a crown of
righteousness as a reward (2 Tim. 4:7-8).
# 69. Christ Occupied for Us

THE activities of the Lord Jesus, as He is occupied in His present
service, is a fruitful subject. Fruitful in more ways than one. It is
fruitful because it reminds us of His love in His present ministry for
us; and of our love to Him, which should be expressed in a similar way
to His love to us.

1.  His **heart** is occupied in His loving sympathy for us, as our
    **Faithful Friend.** “He groaned in spirit and was troubled
     . . . .  behold how He loved him” (John 11:33, 36).
2.  His **mind** is occupied in His constant thought of us, as our
    **Divine Lover.** “He thinketh upon me” (Psalm 40:17).
3.  His **eyes** are occupied in His watchful care over us, as our
    **Vigilant Shepherd.** “Behold He that keepeth Israel shall neither
    slumber nor sleep” (Psalm 121:4).
4.  His **hands** are occupied in His untiring labour for us, as our
    **Unfailing Strength.** “I will uphold thee with the right hand of
    My righteousness” (Isaiah 41:10).
5.  His **ears** are occupied in His unceasing attention to us, as our
    **Gracious Lord.** “His ears are open unto their cry” (Ps. 34:15).
6.  His **lips** are occupied in His earnest pleading for us, as our
    **Great High Priest.** “He ever liveth to make intercession for
    them” (Hebrews 7:25).
7.  His **feet** are occupied in His ministry for us, as our
    **Sustaining Companion** (Luke 24:15).

# 70. Christ, Our Example

“Do likewise” (Judges 7:17).

GIDEON bids his men to look to him and to act as he acts, so that there
may be united action. When he blew his trumpet they were to blow theirs;
when he brake his pitcher they were to break theirs; and when he shouted
they were to shout too. The Lord Jesus also says to His followers, “Look
on Me and do likewise.”

1.  He bids us **love** as He loves (John 13:34).
2.  He calls us to **suffer** wrongfully as He suffered (1 Pet.
    2:20-23).
3.  He tells us to go out in **service**, as He went (John 20:21).
4.  He directs us to **deny** ourselves as He denied Himself (John
    12:24-25).
5.  He commands us to **minister** to each other as He ministers to us
    (John 13:14-15).
6.  He calls us to be **humble**, as He was (Phil. 2:5-8).
7.  He demands that we should **walk** as He walked (1 John 2:6).

# 71. Christ, Our Hiding Place

1.  HE is a **Safe** Hiding Place. “A Covert from the tempest” (Isaiah
    32:2). “Thou shalt hide them in the secret of Thy presence from the
    pride of man; Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
    strife of tongues” (Psalm 31:20).\
     Note the three “froms” in the above verses as showing that from
    which the Lord saves.
2.  He is a **Sure** Hiding Place. “In the time of trouble He shall hide
    me in His pavilion; in the *secret*\* of His tabernacle shall He
    hide me” (Psalm 27:5). Note the two “*Shalls*.” There is no
    uncertainty.
3.  He is a **Secret** Hiding Place. “Thou art my *Hiding Place*; Thou
    shalt preserve from trouble” (Psalm 32:7). The word “Hiding” in the
    above is rendered “Secret” in some of the Scriptures before us, and
    is so given in 1 Samuel 19:2, which may be taken as an illustration.
4.  He is a **Comfortable** Hiding Place. “I will abide in Thy
    tabernacle for ever; I will trust in the *covert* of Thy wings”
    (Psalm 61:4). The young birds find the covert of the mother bird’s
    wings a place of comfort.
5.  He is a **Strong** Hiding Place. “He that dwelleth in the *secret
    place* of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the
    Almighty (Psalm 91:1). Note, it is the “*Almighty*” who is the
    Shelterer.
6.  He is a **Secure** Hiding Place. “Thou art my *Hiding Place* and my
    Shield; I hope in Thy Word” (Psalm 119:114). He assures us in His
    Word what He is, hence our security.
7.  He is a **Communing** Hiding Place. “O, my dove, thou art in the
    clefts of the rock, in the *secret places* of the stairs, let me see
    thy countenance, let me hear thy voice,” &c. (Cant. 2:14). The Lord
    is not a cold hard rock in which we hide; He is a living Person,
    with whom we hold converse.

* * * * *

\* The *words in the texts in italics* are so given to indicate that in
the Hebrew they are one and the same.
# 72. Christ, Our Life

THERE are many words and phrases that are peculiar to John; for
instance, the double “verily,” “excepts,” and “true” things. John’s
Gospel is peculiar in itself. Matthew shows us Christ as “King,” Mark as
the “Servant,” Luke as the “Man,” and John as the “Life.” This may be
traced right through John.

Chapter 20:The **Peace** of life (John 20:19).

Chapter 21:The **Instructions** of life (John 21:15).
# 73. Christ, Our Object

1.  HE is the Object of God’s **Counsels**. “I was daily His delight”
    (Prov. 8:30).
2.  He is the Object of the **Scriptures**. “Search the Scriptures.…and
    they are they which testify of Me” (John 5:39).
3.  He is the Object of our **Faith**. “Behold the Lamb of God” (John
    1:29, 36).
4.  He is the Object of our **Worship**. “And he worshipped Him” (John
    9:38).
5.  He is the Object of our **Life**. “Should not henceforth live unto
    themselves, but unto Him” (2 Cor. 5:15).
6.  He is the Object of our **Imitation**. “Christ also suffered for us,
    leaving us an Example” (1 Peter 2:21).
7.  He is the Object of our **Hope**. “Lord Jesus Christ, which is our
    Hope” (1 Tim. 1:1).

# 74. Christ, Our Substitute

WE must know Christ “for us” as our Substitute, before we can know
Christ “in us” as our Strength, and before we can be with Him in the
glory.

1.  Christ is the **God-appointed** Substitute (Romans 5:8).
2.  Christ is the **God-approved** Substitute (Eph. 5:2).
3.  Christ is the **God-satisfying** Substitute (2 Corinthians 5:21;
    Galatians 3:13).
4.  Christ is the **Protecting** Substitute from Divine wrath (1 Cor.
    5:7).
5.  Christ, as our Substitute, **places** us in an **unparalleled
    position** (1 Thessalonians 5:9-10).
6.  As our Substitute, Christ has **procured** for us **unlimited
    blessings** (Romans 8:32).
7.  Christ, in being our Substitute, had a **practical** end in view
    (Titus 2:14; 1 John 3:16; 1 Peter 2:20-21; 1 Peter 4:1).

In all the above Scriptures the words “*for us*” will be found.
# 75. Christ's Peaceful Reign

ISAIAH 11:1-9

THE term “The kingdom of God” is like a majestic river which is made up
of three tributary rivers, hence the three rivers make the one what it
is, in its flow and force. There is the kingdom of grace, or the
spiritual realm into which the believer in Christ is introduced (Col.
1:13); there is the kingdom of glory, or the millennial reign of Christ
over the earth (Rev. 5:10); there is the kingdom of God, or the eternal
government of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as the one God (1 Cor.
15:24). In the first, “*Grace* reigns through righteousness unto eternal
life” (Rom. 5:21); in the second, “A *King* shall reign in
righteousness” (Isaiah 32:1); and in the third, Righteousness shall
*dwell* (2 Peter 3:13).

Christ is now seated upon His Father’s throne (Rev. 3:21), but He will
yet sit upon His own throne (Matt. 25:31). It is after His appearing in
judgment with His saints, that Christ sets up His kingdom, as the Holy
Spirit implies when He speaks of Christ’s “appearing and kingdom” (2
Tim. 4:1). His appearing first, and then His kingdom. There can be no
millennium without the King. There is a time coming when the kingdoms of
this world shall have become the kingdoms of the Lord and His Christ
(Rev. 11:15). It is also stated that at the end of the thousand years of
Christ’s millennial reign (Rev. 20:4-6) He will give up the kingdom to
His Father (1 Cor. 15:24).

The Scriptures are occupied with two main facts, namely, Christ’s
sufferings and His glory (Luke 24:26), and these two facts are like two
mighty girders of a bridge, which are the main factors in the bridge,
and to which the rest of the bridge is related. Thus, all truth is
related to Christ’s suffering and glory. Or, to change the figure,
Christ’s suffering and glory are the Jachin and Boaz, the supporting
pillars of the great temple of truth (1 Kings 7:21). Now, as Christ has
actually and literally suffered and died, so He will as actually and as
surely reign in glory, and on the earth where He was rejected and where
He suffered.

In the points before us we have one or two intimations as to the
character of Christ’s Kingship.

1.  **Royal King** (Isa 11:1). He comes from the royal line of David,
    for He is to be a stem out of Jesse. Christ is the Son of Man as to
    His humanity; the Son of God as to His Deity; the Son of David as to
    His royalty. It is as the latter He is to sit on the throne of His
    father David (Luke 1:32; Ps. 132:11; Isa. 9:6-7).
2.  **Regal King** (Isa 11:2). Many an earthly king has been royal as to
    the place he occupied, but has not been attired in the regal robes
    of moral worth as far as his life was concerned. It is in this sense
    that I use the word “regal,” for the regalia of moral and spiritual
    worth were ever seen in the life of Christ, and will be seen in Him
    as King, as is indicated in the sevenfold characteristic of the Holy
    Spirit resting upon Him.
3.  **Regarding King**. The Revised Version of Isa 11:3 reads, “His
    delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.” As Christ delighted to do
    the will of God in His humiliation (Psalm 40:8), so the same delight
    shall fill Him in His glory.
4.  **Righteous King** (Isa 11:4-5). No unrighteousness shall be in Him,
    and no unrighteous action shall ever be done by Him. No bribe shall
    buy Him, and no action shall blind Him.
5.  **Resolute King** (Isa 11:4). He shall smite the wicked. Saul lost
    his kingdom through his hesitation to slay the enemy of God (1
    Samuel 15:22-23), but with Christ there will be no hesitation, for
    resolutely and faithfully shall He put down the wicked one mentioned
    in 2 Thess. 2:8, and all who, like him, are guilty of selfwill.
6.  **Rest-giving King** (Isa 11:6-8). The whole creation, which now
    groaneth and travaileth in pain, is to be delivered into the
    glorious liberty of the children of God (Romans 8:21-22). The animal
    creation is to share in the peace of the peaceful reign of Christ
    (Isa 65:25).
7.  **Regenerating King** (Isa 11:9). The earth, which has been cursed
    and blighted by sin, is to share in the blessing of Christ’s rule.
    The time of regeneration (Matt. 19:28), the time of the restoration
    of all things (Acts 3:21, R.V.), is when Christ reigns in millennial
    glory. The presence of Christ is the great factor in this reign of
    peace. In like manner, as Christ is known now, and allowed to reign
    in our hearts, so we have peace.

# 76. Christ's Perfection

CHRIST was perfect in all He was, in all He said, in all He did, and in
all His life.

1.  There was no rift in the lute of His character, for He did always
    the things which were pleasing to His Father (Matt. 3:17).
2.  There was no flaw in the devotion of His life, for He knew no sin (2
    Cor. 5:21).
3.  There was no fault in the consecration of His service, for He
    finished the work given Him to do (John 17:4).
4.  There was no stain in the texture of His nature, for He was without
    sin (1 John 3:5).
5.  There was no alloy in the gold of His holiness, for He was the Holy
    One of God (Mark 1:24).
6.  There was no spot in the sun of His testimony, for He did no sin (1
    Peter 2:22).
7.  There was no want in the obedience of His love, for He was faithful
    to death (Phil. 2:8).

\




# 77. Christ's Prayer in Gethsemane

THE characteristics of the prayer of Christ are:―

1.  It was a **lonely** prayer. He withdrew Himself about a stone’s cast
    from His disciples, as He went to prayer (Luke 22:41).
2.  It was a **humble** prayer. In Mark, we are told Christ “knelt,” and
    in Matthew, that He fell upon His face. The attitude of His body in
    an indication of the posture of His spirit.
3.  It was a **filial** prayer. He does not say here, as He did
    afterwards, “My God,” &c., but “Abba Father.” The former reminds of
    God’s dealing in judgment with sin: the latter is the Father making
    known His will (Mark 14:36).
4.  It was an **earnest** prayer (Luke 22:44; Heb. 5:7).
5.  It was a **repeated** prayer. He used “the same words” (Matthew
    26:44).
6.  It was a **persevering** prayer. He prayed three times (Matt.
    26:44).
7.  It was a **resigned** prayer. “Not My will,” &c. (Luke 22:42). “‘My
    will, not Thine, be done,’ turned Paradise into a desert; and ‘Thy
    will, not Mine be done,’ turned the desert into a Paradise.”
8.  It was an **answered** prayer. In Luke 22:43, we are told an angel
    came and strengthened Him.

\




# 78. Christ's Resurrection

No one can over-estimate the importance of the truth of Christ’s
resurrection. If this be overthrown, Christianity is a farce, Christ is
a liar, the apostles were deluded, the martyrs were deceived, the
believer is in the darkness of despair, God is unknown, and our loved
ones are for ever lost. As Dr. Kennedy says:― “Blot the resurrection out
of the story of Christ, and you may as well blot out Christ Himself.
Blot out Christ, and you may as well blot out God. For all our true
conceptions of Him, and all our true affections towards Him, grow out of
the filial relation to Him, to which Christ lovingly restores us. And
’God added to, or deducted from the sum of existence,’ makes existence
an altogether different thing from what it would otherwise be. Save us,
by any means, from the conclusion of the sceptic, who could only see an
’empty heaven looking down upon a soul-less earth.’”

What light is to the earth, Christ’s resurrection is to the believer.

1.  **The risen Christ is Christ’s attestation to the reality of His
    claims.** Again and again He said that He would rise again from the
    dead. After His transfiguration He told His disciples that He would
    die and rise again, but they did not understand Him, and we find
    them questioning among themselves as to what this rising from among
    the dead could mean (Matt. 17:9; Mark 9:9-10). As Christ is
    journeying towards Jerusalem, He takes them apart, and seeks to
    impress upon them the same truth (Matt. 20:19). And at the sepulchre
    the angels reminded the women of what He had told them (Luke 24:7).
2.  **The risen Christ is the Clue to the understanding of the
    Scripture.** When Mary Magdalene told Peter and John that the tomb
    of Christ was empty, they did not believe her, so they ran to the
    tomb to see for themselves. The Divine comment upon this is, “For as
    yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead”
    (John 20:9). See John 2:22; Acts 2:24-32; Acts 13:32, 35.
3.  **The risen Christ is the fulfilment of His own word as to the
    necessity of His resurrection to complete His atoning work.** After
    Peter’s confession of faith as to the Person of Christ, at Caesarea
    Philippi, we read. that Christ began “to shew unto His disciples He
    must go unto Jerusalem,” &c. (Matt. 16:21; Acts 3:18).
4.  **The risen Christ is the Channel of blessing** (Acts 5:30-31;
    10:40; 13:37-38).
5.  **The risen Christ is the Object of our faith** (Rom. 10:9; 1 Peter
    1:21).
6.  **The risen Christ is the Assurance of our justification** (Romans
    4:25).
7.  **The risen Christ is our Answer to every accusation** (Romans
    8:34).
8.  **The risen Christ is put to the believer’s account** (Rom. 6:5;
    Col. 2:12).
9.  **The risen Christ is the Model, Aim, and End of the believer’s
    life** (2 Cor. 5:15).
10. **The risen Christ is the ground of Christ’s claim to the believer,
    and His protection of him** (Rom. 14:8-9).
11. **The risen Christ is the Pledge of our inheritance** (1 Peter 1:3).
12. **The risen Christ is the Earnest of our being glorified with
    Christ** (Romans 8:11).
13. **The risen Christ is the guarantee that our loved ones, who have
    fallen asleep, shall be raised** (1 Cor. 15:20).
14. **The risen Christ is God’s bond that we shall see our loved ones
    again** (1 Thess. 4:14).
15. **The risen Christ is the exhibition of God’s power** (Eph. 1:20).
16. **The risen Christ is the worker’s theme in testimony** (Acts
    3:15-16; 4:10).
17. **The risen Christ is our Commissioner for service** (Gal. 1:1).
18. **The risen Christ is the positive proof that God will judge the
    world in righteousness** (Acts 17:31).
19. **The risen Christ should be the desire of all our life** (Phil.
    3:10).

# 79. Christ's Voice

1.  **Powerful Voice.** “His voice as the sound of many waters”
    (Revelation 1:15).
2.  **Convicting Voice.** “Heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul,
    why persecutest thou Me?” (Acts 9:4).
3.  **Quickening Voice.** “He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
    forth” (John 11:43).
4.  **Inviting Voice.** “If any man thirst let him come unto Me and
    drink” (John 7:37).
5.  **Comforting Voice.** “Jesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise
    again” (John 11:23).
6.  **Guiding Voice.** “My sheep hear My voice.…and they follow Me”
    (John 10:27).
7.  **Pleading Voice.** “If any man hear My voice” (Rev. 3:20).

\




# 80. Christ, the Bread of Life

JOHN 6:27-35

AMONG the many “I Am’s" of the Gospel of John, is the one that speaks of
Christ as the Bread of Life. There are seven things that relate to
Christ as the Bread of Life.

1.  Christ is the **Sealed** Bread, as attesting His genuineness (John
    6:27). In the East, bakers who were found selling bread that was not
    of good quality, were severely punished. In Turkey, not very long
    since, cheating bakers were nailed up by the ear; and in Persia they
    have been roasted in their own ovens. The Oriental bakers are in the
    habit of stamping their name upon their bread, or, as they would
    say, “sealing it,” as a measure of precaution, lest they should be
    made to suffer for the sins of their neighbours, and also as
    attesting its good quality. “The Talmudic word for baker is
    *nakhtom*, or *nakhtoma*, which has been connected with *khatham*,
    to seal.” Christ was sealed by His Father, at His baptism, with the
    Holy Spirit, and His works afterwards by the Holy Spirit’s power
    told out in unmistakable language that He was the Sealed of God
    (Acts 10:38).
2.  Christ is the **Sent** Bread, as to the authority of His coming
    (John 6:32-33). If there was one thing more than another that Christ
    affirmed again and again, it was, that He was sent from God to do a
    specific work. As proof of this, look through the Gospel of John,
    and mark the word “sent,” which occurs over forty times.
3.  Christ is the “**True** Bread,” in contrast to everything that is
    false and fleeting (John 6:32). He is the “True Light” (John 1:9),
    in contrast to the false lights of earth; He is the “True Vine”
    (John 15:1), in contrast to Israel, who proved to be a false vine;
    and He is the “True Bread,” because He is unlike the manna that fell
    in the wilderness, which only satisfied for a time, whilst He saves
    and satisfies for ever. Man-invented theories and pursuits are all
    false and misleading. Pleasure with its fascination, money with its
    glitter, honour with its applause, worldliness with its charm, lust
    with its seeming satisfaction, pride with its ambition, and self
    with its assertiveness, are all disappointing, delusive, and
    destructive. Christ alone is the “True Bethlehem” (House of Bread)
    where salvation and satisfaction are found (Ruth 1:19).
4.  Christ is the **Living** Bread as to His enduringness (John 6:35).
    Those who live upon Him partake of His life; and those who do not
    are spiritually dead. “There is a pathetic story which comes to us
    from the earlier explorers of Australia. There grows there a strange
    plant called the nardoo, bearing leaves like clover. The Britishers,
    Burke and Wills, who were making these explorations, in the failure
    of other food, followed the example of the natives, and began to eat
    the leaves and roots of the nardoo. It seemed to satisfy them; it
    seemed to fill them with a pleasant sense of comfort and repletion.
    But they grew weaker every day, and more emaciated; they were not
    hungry, for the plant seemed to satisfy. But all the effects of an
    unfulfilled hunger began to appear in them; their flesh wasted from
    their bones, their strength failed till they scarcely had the energy
    of an infant; they could not crawl on in their journey more than a
    mile or two a day. At last one of them perished of starvation; the
    other was rescued when in the last extremity. On analysis, it was
    discovered that the bread made of this plant lacked an element
    essential to the sustenance of a European. And so, even though they
    seemed fed, the explorers wasted away, and one of them died, because
    they were feeding on a sustenance inappropriate.” In like manner,
    those who feed on anything else than Christ will find that they have
    been deceived, and will enter into that state described as the
    “second death.”
5.  Christ must be the **Sought** Bread (John 6:27). Christ rebukes the
    people who were following Him for the sake of the food they
    obtained, and urges them to labour for that food which is
    imperishable. Those who seek, have the promise that they shall
    surely find, but those who are listless and careless have no
    promise.
6.  Christ must be the **Received** Bread (John 6:29). To receive Christ
    is to believe in Him (John 1:12), even as the disciples received Him
    into the boat, and thus showed their confidence in Him, by placing
    themselves absolutely in His hands (John 6:21).
7.  Christ is the **Satisfying** Bread (John 6:35). Fuller has well
    said, “The old Grecians that had fed altogether on acorns before,
    after bread came in amongst them they made no reckoning of their
    mast any more, but kept it only for swine. And leathern and iron
    money began to grow out of request amongst the Lacedemonians after
    gold and silver came into use. So, when a man hath once found the
    favour of God in his heart, and the love of God in Christ hath once
    lighted on it, and got assurance of it, he ceaseth then to be greedy
    of the world’s trash, which is, in regard of it but dross or pebble
    stones to gold and diamonds, as mast to the best bread corn; yea,
    rather of far less worth or value to that, than either of these is
    to it.”

# 81. Christ, the Earnest Worker

(JOHN 9:4)

CHRIST’S *authority* for working was because He was “sent;” His *model*
in working was according to the “works of Him” who commissioned Him, and
the *necessity* that was laid upon Him is seen in the “I must.” If the
following Scriptures are pondered, it will be seen how Christ viewed His
life and death as an absolute necessity. Constantly Christ uses the term
“*must*.”

1.  The must of **work** (Luke 2:49; John 9:4; 10:16).
2.  The must of **walk** (Luke 13:33).
3.  The must of **death** (John 3:14; 12:34).
4.  The must of **preaching** (Luke 4:43).
5.  The must of **seeking** (John 4:4).
6.  The must of **resurrection** (John 20:9).
7.  The must of **increase** (John 3:30).

# 82. Christ, the Light of the World

(JOHN 9:5)

THERE are two things, among the many, that light does. It reveals the
wrong and makes known that which is right. These two features of light
are abundantly illustrated in the life of Christ. As to the first, when
the Pharisees brought the woman to Christ, He said to them, “He that is
without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her,” and “being
convicted by their own conscience,” they all slunk out of His holy
presence (John 8:7, 9). And as to Christ’s making known the good, the
right, the true, no one can prayerfully ponder John 3:16 without seeing
the light of His love flashing out in its sevenfold perfection.

1.  There is the **red** light of Christ’s atonement in the *given Son*
    (Acts 20:28).
2.  There is the **blue** light of heaven in the “*God gave*” (2
    Corinthians 9:15).
3.  There is the **yellow** light of heaven’s glory in the “*everlasting
    life*” (Col. 3:4).
4.  There is the **green** light of faith in the “*believe*” (John
    3:36).
5.  There is the **orange** light of safety in the “*shall not perish*”
    (John 10:28).
6.  There is the **purple** light of the eternal state in the
    “*everlasting*” (1 Peter 1:3-4).
7.  There is the **white** light of the *effulgence of God* in the
    “*only begotten Son*” (Heb. 1:5).

# 83. Christ, the Needy One

DOES He who made all things need anything? No, in one sense, as we read
in Acts 17:24-25; but He became a needy One, as we shall see.

*Christ was a needy Man when on earth.*

1.  He had no **home** in which to be born (Luke 2:7).
2.  No **place** to lay His head (Matt. 8:20).
3.  No **money** to pay the tax (Matt. 17:27).
4.  No **comforter** in Gethsemane agony (Matt. 26:40).
5.  No **friend** to plead for Him when He was falsely accused (Mark
    14:50).
6.  No **God** to befriend Him when suffering for sin (Matt. 27:46).
7.  No **grave** of His own in which to be buried (Matt. 27:60).

*Christ became a needy Man that He might meet our need.* “Though He was
rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty
might be rich” (2 Cor. 8:9).

He had no home, that we might have an eternal inheritance (1 Peter 1:4).

He was poor, that we might have all spiritual blessing (Eph. 1:3).

He had no comforter, that we might have the Comforter (John 14:16).

He had no friend, that we might have an abiding Friend (Proverbs 17:17).

He was made sin, that we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor.
5:21).
# 84. Christ, the Prophet

JESUS was recognised as the Prophet that Moses had spoken of and
promised to Israel (Deut. 18:15-18).

  ------------------ --------- ----------------
  **P**owerful       prophet   (Matt. 13:54).
  **R**oyal          prophet   (Matt. 16:16).
  **O**mnipotent     prophet   (Luke 7:16).
  **P**enetrating    prophet   (John 4:19).
  **H**ealing        prophet   (Mark 5:29).
  **E**nlightening   prophet   (John 7:40).
  **T**ruthlul       prophet   (John 3:34).
  ------------------ --------- ----------------

\




# 85. Christ, the True One

1.  HE is the True **Light**, to illuminate (John 1:9).
2.  He is the True **Bread**, to satisfy (John 6:32).
3.  He is the True **Vine**, to fructify (John 15:1).
4.  He is the True **God**, to assure (1 John 5:20).
5.  He is the True **Witness**, to speak (Rev. 3:14).
6.  He is the True **Judge**, to determine (Rev. 19:11).

\




# 86. Christ, the Way

JACOB’S ladder is a type of Christ (John 1:51), the only Way between God
and man. Christ is-

1.  An **Opportune** Way, for the man in danger, even as the manslayer
    found the way to the city of refuge to be (Deut. 19:3).
2.  An **Open** Way, for He has removed the barrier of sin away, hy the
    sacrifice of Himself (Heb. 9:26).
3.  An **Original** Way, for there never was such a way opened as Christ
    has made by His death (Heb. 10:20).
4.  An **Omnipotent** Way, as they who walk in it find, for they are
    protected by the Saviour’s presence and power (Isa. 35:8-9, margin).
5.  The **Only** Way to God (John 14:6), blessing, salvation, and
    usefulness (John 10:9).

# 87. Christ Within the Believer

1.  As the **Life**, to live out. “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth
    in me” (Gal. 2:20).
2.  As the **Power**, for walk and service. “I will dwell in them, and
    walk in them” (2 Cor. 6:16).
3.  As the **Source** of fruit-bearing. “Cannot bear fruit of itself
    except it abide in the vine” (John 15:4).
4.  As the **Word**, to teach. “Let the word of Christ dwell in you
    richly in all wisdom” (Col. 3:16).
5.  As the **Peace**, to rule. “Let the peace of God rule in your
    hearts” (Col. 3:15).
6.  As the **Joy**, to fill. “That your joy might be full” (John 15:11).
7.  As the **Hope** of glory, to cheer. “Christ in you the Hope of
    Glory” (Col. 1:27).

# 88. Christians Are to Be Filled

1.  WITH the **Spirit.** “Be *filled* with the spirit” (Eph. 5:18).
2.  With **comfort.** “I am *filled* with comfort” (2 Cor. 7:4).
3.  With **joy.** “Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy
    tears, that I may be*filled* with joy” (2 Tim. 1:4).
4.  With **fruits of righteousness.** “Being *filled* with the fruits of
    righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise
    of God” (Phil. 1:11).
5.  With the **knowledge of His will.** “*Filled* with the knowledge of
    His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding” (Col. 1:9).
6.  With **good things.** “He hath *filled* the hungry with good things”
    (Luke 1:53).
7.  With all the **fulness of God.** “That ye might be *filled* with all
    the fulness of God” (Eph. 3:19).

# 89. Christian Work

THIS has reference to what we do and are for Christ. The quality of our
works is to be good.

1.  **Christ** is our Example. “I have finished the *work*” (John 17:4).
2.  **Faith** is the principle. “If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would
    do the *works* of Abraham” (John 8:39).
3.  **Love** is the motive. “She hath wrought a good *work*” (Matt.
    26:10).
4.  **Word** of God is our authority. “Let your light so shine.…see your
    good *works*” (Matt. 5:16).
5.  **Holy** Spirit is our power. “Created in Christ Jesus unto good
    *works*” (Eph. 2:10).
6.  **Good** is their character. Dorcas-“Full of good *works*” (Acts
    9:36).
7.  **Evidence** of faith in Christ. Rahab-“Justified by *works*”
    (James. 2:25).
8.  **Tested** at the judgment seat. “The fire shall try every man’s
    *work*” (1 Cor. 3:13).

\




# 90. Circle of Blessing

SATAN said that the Lord had put a hedge about Job on every side (Job
1:10), so that he could not touch him. The Lord has put a hedge of
blessing around the believer, so that he can say-

1.  Isaiah 44:22, is the **Pledge** of my forgiveness.
2.  Gal. 2:20, is the **Confession** of my faith.
3.  John 5:24, is the **Assurance** of my salvation.
4.  Isaiah 41:10, is the **Comfort** of my life.
5.  Psalm 55:22, is the **Joy** of my unceasing privilege.
6.  Luke 19:13, is the **Burden** of my present responsibility.
7.  Phil. 3:20-21, is the **Outlook** of my constant expectation.

# 91. “Come”

Note some of the “*comes*” of Christ as illustrating the fulness and
freeness of His Gospel.

1.  **Regard.** “*Come* down” (Luke 19:5).
2.  **Rest.** “*Come* unto Me, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).
3.  **Refreshment.** “*Come* and drink” (John 7:37). “*Come* and take”
    (Rev. 22:17).
4.  **Re-animation.** “*Come* forth” (John 11:43).
5.  **Responsibility.** “*Come* after Me” (Mark 8:34).
6.  **Reward.** “*Cometh* to Me shall never hunger” (John 6:35).
7.  **Response.** “*Come* and see” (John 1:39).

Mr. Spurgeon says of the last come, this is a “loving invitation,” and
says, “At the beginning of the Gospel, Christ said, ‘Come and see;’ at
the close, ‘Come and dine.’ The first is for babes in Christ, the second
for strong men.”
# 92. Commands of Christ

There were many commands that the Lord Jesus gave His disciples. The
following seven peaks are to be seen in the mountain range of His
directions:―

1.  “**Repent**” (Luke 13:3). Change of mind.
2.  “**Believe**” (John 3:16). Rest of soul.
3.  “**Love**” (John 13:34). Affection of heart.
4.  “**Follow**” (John 12:26). Walk of feet.
5.  “**Abide**” (John 15:4). Attitude of spirit.
6.  “**Tarry**” (Luke 24:49). Pleading of faith.
7.  “**Go**” (Matt. 28:19). Testimony of lips.

\




# 93. Committal

“GLASS, with anxiety!” Strange expression this! What does it mean? These
words accompanied a parcel sent from Norway to England, and they were

Is there not a lesson here for Christians? Might not some of us be
rightly labelled-

“Christians, with anxiety?”

In many instances there is no need for a label, as anxiety is only too
plainly stamped upon the countenance, although the apostolic injunction
is, “in nothing be anxious” (Phil. 4:6, R.V.). Some obey this command in
certain circumstances only, while others reverse the reading, and live
as though they were to be anxious for everything. The Lord wishes His
children to carry their worries and anxieties to Him; and to leave them
with Him. Here are seven things which He bids us cast upon Him, or
commit unto Him.

1.  **Commit yourself unto Him.** “He is able to keep that which I have
    *committed* unto Him against that day” (2 Tim. 1:12). Paul deposited
    himself in the hands of the Heavenly Banker; and, as the money in
    the Bank of England is kept safe in the strong rooms within and by
    the guard without, so was the apostle, for he was kept by the Holy
    Spirit within, and by the Lord who encamped round about him.
2.  **Commit your soul unto Him.** “Wherefore let them that suffer
    according to the will of God *commit* the keeping of their souls to
    Him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator” (1 Peter 4:19).
    Suffering we shall have, but if we commit the keeping of our souls
    unto the Lord in well doing, as the three Hebrew young men did, we
    shall, like them, but lose our bonds, and gain the company of Jesus.
3.  **Commit your spirit unto Him.** “Into Thine hand I *commit* my
    spirit” (Psalm 31:5). If the Lord has the control of our spirit, He
    will control us altogether.
4.  **Commit your way unto Him.** “*Commit* thy way unto the Lord; trust
    also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass” (Psalm 37:5). If we
    commit our way unto Him, we shall never stray from Him.
5.  **Commit your works unto Him.** “*Commit* thy works unto the Lord”
    (Proverbs 16:3). If the Lord controls the works and the workers,
    there will be no clashing in the working.
6.  **Commit your burden unto Him.** “*Cast* thy burden upon the Lord”
    (Psalm 55:22). If the Lord is our Burden-bearer, we shall be free to
    bear one another’s burdens.
7.  **Commit your care unto Him.** “*Casting* all your care upon Him,
    for He careth for you” (1 Peter 5:7). One John Careless, a martyr,
    in writing to a friend, said, “Now my soul is turned to her old rest
    again, and has taken a sweet nap in Christ’s lap. I have cast my
    care upon the Lord, who careth for me, and will be *careless*,
    according to my name.” If we cast all our care upon Him, He will
    take all care off us.

# 94. Compassion of the Lord

WHEN Pharaoh’s daughter saw the fair child, Moses, weeping, she had
compassion upon him, and manifested her love in the kindly interest she
took in him, and the loving care she exercised on his behalf. The word
“*compassion*” is the same that occurs in Malachi, where it speaks of
God sparing those who feared His name: “I will *spare* them, as a man
*spareth* his own son that serveth him” (Mal. 3:17). The same term is
used in speaking of God’s gracious action in His forbearance towards
Israel, when He is said to have “had *compassion* on His people” (2
Chron. 36:15). In Joel 2:18, the word is translated “*pity*,” and is so
given again and again. As Pharaoh’s daughter pitied Moses, so the Lord
has graciously had compassion upon us, for “God commendeth His love
toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us” (Rom.
5:8).

This fact may be further illustrated by the several instances where
Christ is said to have had compassion upon people.

1.  The **Shepherd** having compassion upon the scattered sheep, and
    being willing to save them (Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34).
2.  The **Divine Physician** having compassion upon the sick, and
    healing them (Matt. 14:14).
3.  The **Miracle-worker** having compassion upon the hungry multitude,
    and supplying their need (Matt. 15:32; Mark 8:2).
4.  The **Restorer** having compassion upon the blind men, and giving
    them their sight (Matt. 20:34).
5.  The **Cleanser** having compassion upon the unclean leper, and
    cleansing him (Mark 1:41).
6.  The **Comforter** having compassion upon the sorrowing mother, and
    raising her son to life (Luke 7:13).
7.  The **Good Samaritan** having compassion upon the helpless
    traveller, and taking care of him (Luke 10:33).
8.  The **Almighty Deliverer** having compassion upon the
    demon-possessed man, and liberating him (Mark 5:19).
9.  The **Father** having compassion upon the prodigal, and giving him a
    royal welcome (Luke 15:20).

The **One** who had compassion upon the people when on earth, is the
same One with Whom we have to do.
# 95. Compromise

I. KINGS 20:31-43

1.  *Compromising is* **listening to the enemy instead of listening to
    God** (1Ki. 20:31-33). Ahab should not have listened to the
    overtures of the King of Syria in the face of the definite
    instructions that he had received from God. Neither must the
    Christian pay attention to the suggestions of Satan, as Eve did; nor
    listen to the longings of the natural heart, as Achan did when he
    coveted the forbidden things; nor must we pay heed to what
    half-hearted Christians say. We must follow the Lord fully, as
    Caleb, and be willing to be thought “eccentric,” “odd,” “extreme,”
    “faddist,” “peculiar,” &c.
2.  *Compromising is* **receiving favours from those who are God’s
    enemies** (1Ki. 20:34). It would have been perfectly right for Ahab
    to have received the cities that his father had lost from the hand
    of God, but to receive them from Ben-hadad was wrong. In like
    manner, for the believer in Christ to receive anything from the
    world in the shape of money to carry on God’s work (3 John 7; 1 Cor.
    9:15-18; 2 Cor. 8:5), or to adopt methods that are of the world, is
    to put the unconverted in a wrong position, and to bring discredit
    on the name of Christ.
3.  *Compromising is to* **enter into a covenant with those who are not
    the Lord’s** (1Ki. 20:34). 2 Cor. 6:14-18 is very plain as to the
    attitude the believer in Christ should maintain. The only place of
    safety is separation unto Christ. Separation unto Christ! Not
    separation for separation’s sake, for that would be Phariseeism, but
    separation for Christ’s sake, because He commands it; for we cannot
    have fellowship with Him and the world too.
4.  *Compromising* **does not pay** (1Ki. 20:42-43). Ahab had to pay
    very dearly for his self-will and disobedience. To be “out and out”
    is the best policy, looking at the question from policy’s
    standpoint, which is not the Christian’s ground. Better for our own
    sakes to keep to the lines of God’s truth, for then we shall surely
    make progress, even as the train does by keeping on the metals.

# 96. Conditions of Power

1.  **Saved by Christ’s grace.** “Thou hast neither part nor lot in this
    matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God” (Acts 8:21).
2.  **Standing in Christ’s acceptance.** “The Gospel . . . . which also
    ye have received and wherein ye stand” (1 Cor. 15:1).
3.  **Obedience to Christ.** “The Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to
    them that obey Him” (Acts 5:32).
4.  **Fellowship with Christ.** “By Whom ye were called unto the
    fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Cor. 1:9).
5.  **Waiting upon Christ.** “These all continued with one accord in
    prayer and supplication” (Acts 1:14).
6.  **Expecting from Christ.** Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until
    ye be endued with power from on high” (Luke 24:49).
7.  **Faith in Christ.** “Doeth he it by the works of the law or by the
    hearing of faith?” (Gal. 3:2, 5).

\




# 97. Confession, the Forerunner of Blessing

CONFESSION is the forerunner of blessing.

1.  **Abraham** said, “I am dust and ashes” (Gen. 18:27), and got all he
    asked for.
2.  **Isaiah**, “I am unclean,” and got cleansed (Isa. 6:5).
3.  **Job**, “I am vile,” and got blessing (Job 40:4).
4.  **David**, Born in sin, and got covered (Ps. 51:5; 32:1).
5.  **Peter**, “I am a sinful man,” and received the keys of the kingdom
    (Luke 5:8; Matt. 16:19).
6.  **Publican**, “the sinner,” and went home justified (Luke 18:13,
    R.V., M.).
7.  **The prodigal**, “I am not worthy,” and was feasted (Luke 15:21).

# 98. Contrasts

As the world is full of contrasts-light and darkness, joy and sorrow,
calm and storm, riches and poverty, cleanliness and filth, health and
sickness, life and death-so the Scriptures present to us many opposites.

1.  Abel, the man of **confidence**; and Cain, the man of **conceit**
    (Gen. 4:3-7).
2.  Abraham, the man of **faith**; and the king of Sodom, the man of the
    **world** (Gen. 14:22-24).
3.  Isaac, the man of **promise**; and Ishmael, the man of the **flesh**
    (Gal. 4:29).
4.  Jacob, the man of **prayer**; and Esau, the man of **pleasure**
    (Hosea 12:4; Heb. 12:16).
5.  Moses, the man of **God**; and Pharaoh, the man of **stubbornness**
    (Num. 12:3; Exodus 8:32).
6.  David, the man of **consecration**; and Saul, the man of
    **compromise** (Acts 13:22; 1 Samuel 15:26).
7.  John, the man of **fearlessness**; and Herod, the man of
    **vacillation** (Matt. 14:1-12).

\




# 99. Conversion

THE following sevenfold contrast will demonstrate what conversion is:―

1.  “Dead in sins” (Eph. 2:1). “Passed from death” (John 5:24).
2.  “Condemned” (John 3:18). “Justified” (Rom. 5:1).
3.  “Lost” (Luke 19:10). “Saved” (Eph. 2:8).
4.  “Under sin” (Gal. 3:22). “Under grace” (Rom. 6:14).
5.  “Without Christ” (Eph. 2:12). “1 Christ” (2 Cor. 12:2).
6.  “Sinners” (1 Tim. 1:15). “Saints” (1 Cor. 1:2).
7.  “Astray” (Isaiah 53:6). “Abiding” (John 15:4).

# 100. Conviction of Sin

THE things that come to the heart and produce conviction of sin are a
consciousness of-

1.  The law broken by us (Gal. 3:10).
2.  The heart defiled by sin (Matt. 15:19-20).
3.  The nature wrong (John 3:6).
4.  Failure to come up to God’s glory (Rom. 3:23).
5.  Helpless condition (Rom. 5:6).
6.  Hopeless state (Eph. 2:12).
7.  Indebtedness to God (Luke 7:41-42).

# 101. Countenance of the Lord

1.  **The grace of His countenance.** “The Lord lift up His
    *countenance* upon thee, and give thee peace” (Num. 6:26).
2.  **Reflection of His countenance.** “Lord, lift Thou up the light of
    Thy *countenance* upon us” (Psalm 4:6).
3.  **Joy of His countenance.** “Thou hast made him exceeding glad with
    Thy *countenance*” (Psalm 21:6).
4.  **Saving of His countenance.** “For the help of His *countenance*”
    (Psalm 42:5, 11).
5.  **Renewing of His countenance.** “Who is the health of my
    *countenance* and my God” (Psalm 43:5).
6.  **Power of His countenance.** “Neither did their own arm save
    them . . . . . but the light of Thy *countenance*” (Psalm 44:3).
7.  **Place for the believer to walk in.** “They shall walk, O Lord, in
    the light of Thy *countenance*” (Psalm 89:15).
8.  **Discernment of His countenance.** “Our secret sins in the light of
    Thy *countenance*” (Psalm 90:8).

# 102. Courage

1.  COURAGE is the Divine **nerve** that enables us to go forward at the
    Lord’s bidding in spite of all obstacles, as seen in the case of
    Joshua (Joshua 1:6-7, 9, 18).
2.  Courage gives **fibre** to the moral nature, so that we gladly keep
    the Lord’s Word (Joshua 23:6).
3.  Courage is the **helm** that keeps the soul according to the Divine
    compass of God’s truth, and makes us regardless of the storms we may
    encounter (Deut. 31:6-7).
4.  Courage is the **secret** of a true life, for the God of Grace and
    Power is the feeder of it (1 Chron. 22:13; 28:20).
5.  Courage is the **fire** that shall make us burn with a holy zeal for
    the Lord’s honour and glory, as we are acting under the Lord’s
    instructions (2 Chron. 15:8; Ezra 10:4).
6.  Courage is the **forerunner** of blessing, for as we wait on the
    Lord in good courage, He comes in His grace and strengthens us
    (Psalm 27:14; 31:24).
7.  Courage is the **steadfastness of faith**, which looks up to the
    Lord, and counts upon Him to give the victory in conflict (2 Sam.
    10:12).

# 103. Covetousness

I. KINGS xxi

1.  COVETOUSNESS always seeks to take away from another that which would
    be to the other’s advantage (1Ki 21:1-2).
2.  Covetousness is regardless of God’s Word (1Ki 21:3; Lev. 25:23).
3.  Covetousness is displeased when it does not accomplish its purpose
    (1Ki 21:4).
4.  Covetousness will allow dishonest and diabolical means to obtain its
    end (1Ki 21:5-9).
5.  Covetousness will lie, by bearing false witness to get its desire
    (1Ki 21:10-13, 16).
6.  Covetousness is noted by God (1Ki 21:17-19).
7.  Covetousness is not allowed to go unrebuked (1Ki 21:20-25).
8.  “Covetousness is idolatry” (1Ki 21:26; Col. 3:5).
9.  Covetousness brings evil on others (1Ki 21:29).
10. Covetousness brings punishment (1Ki 21:21; Hab. 2:9-12).

# 104. Covetousness

COVETOUSNESS is the root of all evils. It-

1.  **Blunts** the sensitive nerve of love (Jude 11).
2.  **Blurs** the picture of life (2 Tim. 4:10).
3.  **Banishes** the companionship of generosity (Matt. 13:22).
4.  **Breeds** the evil worm of discontent (1 Tim. 6:5-8).
5.  **Burdens** the spirit with the load of sorrow (1 Tim. 6:10).
6.  **Blinds** the eyes to the beauty of Christ (Luke 18:22-24).
7.  **Blasts** the unscrupulous devotee with an unholy passion and
    endless misery (1 Tim. 6:9).



# 105. Crossing the Jordan

JOSHUA 3:5-17

ISRAEL’S crossing the Jordan was a new epoch in their history. The
wilderness with its zigzag path of unbelief was to be left behind, while
Canaan with its abundant supply was about to be possessed. The typical
teaching for the believer in Christ is, that when he sees the river of
God’s judgment rolling over his old sinful self, as the stones which
represented Israel were placed in the bed of the Jordan (Josh. 4:9), and
as he beholds himself seated with Christ in heavenly places, as
illustrated in the stones which were placed in Gilgal (Josh. 4:20), then
he is enabled to walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4).

1.  **A Sanctified People** (Josh. 3:5). It was essential that the
    people should be sanctified, before the Lord could do wonders among
    them. The wonders of God’s power are performed through a people who
    are separated to Himself; and the wonders of His grace are exhibited
    when He is sanctified as Lord in the heart (1 Pet. 3:15).
2.  **The Obedient Priests** (Josh. 3:6-17). The priests acted according
    to the instructions given to them by Joshua. They were to take up
    the ark, pass over before the people, and stand in the bed of the
    Jordan till all the people had gone over. The priests in their
    priestly service were first and they were last. Thus, those who are
    believers in Christ are to remember that the priestly service of
    prayer, supplication, thanksgiving, and communion with the Lord come
    before more active service, and must come after it. As the ark of
    the covenant was seen by the people because it was on the shoulders
    of the priests, so Christ should always be seen in our work for the
    Lord.
3.  **An Honoured Leader** (Josh. 3:7). Joshua had been a faithful
    servant of the Lord, and now the Lord is about to honour him by
    working a wondrous miracle through him in causing the Jordan to roll
    back. Those who magnify the Lord by their loving obedience and
    praise (Psalm 34:3; 1 Chron. 17:24), the Lord will magnify with His
    favour and power (Joshua 4:14; 1 Chron. 29:25).
4.  **A Listening Servant** (Josh. 3:8). Joshua listens attentively to
    the voice of the Lord as He directs him what he is to do. We must
    wait before we run (Isaiah 40:31), tarry (Luke 24:49) before we are
    empowered (Acts 2:1-2), receive before we can give (Acts 1:8), be
    taught before we can teach (Isaiah 50:4, R.V.), and listen before we
    speak (Luke 10:39).
5.  **A Faithful Messenger** (Josh. 3:9). Having received the message,
    Joshua gives it to Israel. There were no deductions or additions,
    there was simply a reproduction. In like manner, when we receive the
    message of the Lord, as given in His Word, we must not add to it nor
    take from it (Deut. 12:32; Rev. 22:18). People are apt to do one of
    three things in connection with God’s Word, namely, take from, add
    to, or alter. Notice that Eve did all three. She *took from* when
    she left out the word “freely” (see Gen. 3:2, and 2:16); she *added
    to* when she put in the word “touch” (see Gen. 3:3. and 2:17); and
    she *altered* when she said, “lest ye die” (Gen. 3:3), when God had
    said, “Thou shalt surely die” (Gen. 2:17).
6.  **The Almighty Conqueror** (Josh. 3:10). The living God was to be
    the One who would drive out their enemies. It was not a question of
    their skill or of their power, but of the Lord’s doings. The one
    essential is to be strong in the power of His might (Eph. 6:10), and
    to have faith in Him to overcome (1 John 5:4), then no giant can
    stand before us (1 Sam. 17:45).
7.  **The Symbolic Ark** (Josh. 3:11). The ark is the symbol of
    Jehovah’s presence. Six times the ark is called “the ark of the
    covenant” (Josh. 3:3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17); twice it is called “the
    ark” (Josh. 3:15); once it is called “the ark of the Lord” (Josh.
    3:13); once it is called “the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all
    the earth” (Josh. 3:11); and once there is the addition to the words
    “the ark of the Lord” of the expression, “The Lord of all the
    earth.” “*The* ark” is so called because there is only one; “the ark
    of the *covenant*” is so called because it contained the law; “the
    ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth” is so designated
    because He possesses all things; and “the ark of the Lord, the Lord
    of all the earth,” is so described because no power can stand before
    Him. All this can be applied to Christ.
8.  **Representative Men** (Josh. 3:12). The twelve men taken from the
    twelve tribes, from each tribe a man, signifies that these men were
    each acting in the place of the tribe. Christ is the Representative
    Man for the believer. He acts on our behalf (Hebrews 9:24).
9.  **The Supreme Power** (Josh. 3:13-17). The waters of Jordan could
    not stand before the *fiat* and presence of Jehovah (Psalm 104:7);
    neither can the waters of judgment nor the waters of trouble (Isaiah
    43:2) immerse the child of God. “No condemnation” and “no
    separation” are the two pillars of the temple of truth. As long as
    we are behind the omnipotent power of Jehovah no force of earth, no
    might of hell, and no weapon forged by man can touch or harm us.

# 106. David and Goliath

I. SAMUEL 17:38-51

IN the valleys mentioned in Scripture, there have been enacted many
wonderful scenes, and not least among them is the Valley of Elah (1 Sam.
17:2). A valley is suggestive of lowliness, fruitfulness, and fertility.
The valleys of Scripture bloom with the truths of graces, and are
fruitful with the triumphs of God.

1.  **Trained.** The central figure of this reading is David. Up to the
    time of the incident before us, he had appeared very little in
    public, but the Lord had been fitting him for His service. He had
    learnt to know God in secret, hence he can now bear testimony of Him
    in public. David knew that the Lord, whose strength had proved
    sufficient in giving him the victory over the lion and the bear,
    would give him the victory over the Philistine (1Sa 17:36-37). “The
    Lord had been preparing an instrument for this new and difficult
    work. He trains in secret those whom He is about to use in public.
    He makes His servants acquainted with Himself in the secret
    solemnity of His sanctuary, and causes His greatness to pass in
    review before them, that they may be able to look with a steady gaze
    at the difficulties of their path. Thus it was with David. He had
    been alone with God while keeping the sheep in the wilderness; his
    soul had become filled with the thought of God’s power; and now he
    makes his appearance in the Valley of Elah, in all the
    self-renouncing dignity of a man of faith.”
2.  **Trammelled** (1Sa 17:38-39). Saul arms David with his armour, but
    David is only trammelled by the coat of mail, and puts it off. He
    cannot go to the Lord’s battle with man’s equipment. Satan often
    seeks to tempt the Lord’s servants to put on some suit of mail out
    of his armoury. He endeavours to influence the man of prayer to
    adopt the covering of half-heartedness; he will try to induce the
    separated man to wear the robe of worldly conformity, and he will
    seek to trammel the Christian warrior with fleshly armour.
3.  **Taunted** (1Sa 17:42-44). The Philistine taunts David with jeers
    and sneers. As with David, so with the Christian. The man of faith
    is sure to be taunted with the scantiness of his implements of war,
    with the unwisdom of his methods, and with the foolishness of his
    faith in an Unseen Power; but let them laugh that lose, they are
    sure to who win. The only thing that Christ has told us we shall
    receive from the world is persecution (John 16:33). They who live
    godly in Christ Jesus will have to suffer for it (2 Timothy 3:12),
    but that only brings us into closer fellowship with Him who suffered
    (1 Peter 4:1) on our account, and gives us a great blessing of
    happiness (1 Peter 5:10).
4.  **Trusting.** The man of faith does not trust in his weapons (1Sa
    17:40), but in the Lord Himself (1Sa 17:45), and in His action on
    behalf of the trustful one (1Sa 17:46-47). “It is interesting to
    observe David’s address to Goliath. He does not say, ’I come to thee
    with a sling and a stone.’ No; but, ’in the name of the Lord of
    Hosts.’ With him the means were nothing-God everything.” Thus faith
    ever honours God, taking no credit to itself; and God honours faith
    in consequence, by giving complete victory.
5.  **Triumph** (1Sa 17:50-51). The triumph of David is a type of
    David’s Son and Lord triumphing over all the power of the enemy, as
    one has remarked, “The claims of justice could not be met-death and
    judgment frowned in the distance, and man could only tremble at the
    prospect. But, blessed be the God of all grace, a Deliverer has
    appeared-One mighty to save, the Son of God, the true David, the
    anointed King of Israel, and of all the earth. He has met the need,
    filled up the gap, satisfied the yearnings of the heart. But how?
    When? Where? By His death on Calvary, in that terrible hour when all
    creation was made to feel the solemn reality of what was being
    transacted.….The poor trembling sinner may stand by and behold the
    conflict, and the glorious issue thereof-may behold all the power of
    the enemy laid low by one stroke of his glorious Deliverer, and feel
    the crushing burden rolled, by the same stroke, from his struggling
    spirit. The tide of Divine peace and joy may flow into his soul, and
    he walk abroad in the full power of his emancipation, purchased for
    him by the blood, and proclaimed in the Gospel.”

# 107. David and Goliath

I. SAMUEL 17:38-51

DAVID, in his triumph over the giant, illustrates the power and victory
of faith.

1.  **Renunciation of faith** (1Sa 17:39). Saul is an illustration of
    the man of the flesh, who counts upon a good armour for protection,
    and he seeks to encumber the man of faith with a like protection.
    The man of faith tries on the armour, but finds that he cannot act
    in it, and therefore puts it off. Earth resources are not God’s
    resources, hence the man of faith must not depend on the former, but
    on the latter. The man of faith puts off the weights that would
    hinder him (Heb. 12:1), the clothing of the old man (Eph. 4:22; Col.
    3:8), and the weapons of earth’s warfare (2 Cor. 10:4).
2.  **Weapons of faith** (1Sa 17:40). A staff, a sling, and five smooth
    stones out of the brook Kidron, are all the weapons that faith
    takes. The staff of the Lord’s presence (Isaiah 50:10; Psalm 23:4),
    the sling of God’s Word, and the five smooth stones which are found
    in the stream of Christ’s mediatorial action and Person are the
    weapons of faith. The five smooth stones are—\
     Christ *is*, Christ *can*, Christ *has*, Christ *will*, Christ
    *does*.\
    -   “*Christ is*.” His living presence is our confidence and
        consolation (Isaiah 41:10).
    -   “*Christ can*.” He can conquer, for He stooped to conquer, and
        accomplished His purpose (Luke 11:22; Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15; 1
        John 3:8).
    -   “*Christ has*.” All power is His, and He has all power for us
        (Luke 10:19; Mark 16:17).
    -   “*Christ will*.” He has promised the victory, therefore it is
        sure (1 John 5:4-5).
    -   “*Christ does*.” Faith makes His promise a present effect, and a
        continuous reality (Eph. 6:16; Rev. 12:11).

3.  **Courage of faith.** David did not wait till the giant came up to
    him, he advanced towards the enemy (1Sa 17:40). The Christian should
    not always stand on the defensive, he should be offensive at times
    (2 Cor. 10:5).
4.  **Persecution of faith** (1Sa 17:41-44). Faith is sure to be taunted
    with folly, and sneered at for its unreasonable action. Christ is
    *the* Man of Faith, and as He was “despised” (Is. 53:3), “reviled”
    (1 Peter 2:23), “hated” (John 15:18), and scoffed at (Matt. 27:43);
    so shall we be, for the servant is not above his Lord (John 13:16).
5.  **Testimony of faith** (1Sa 17:45). Not in his own name, nor in his
    own strength did David come against Goliath, but, as he declared, in
    the name and strength of the Lord. In a like manner, the believer
    testifies that the power of the Lord, and the name of Jesus, are the
    potent forces by which spiritual results are achieved (Acts 3:12-13;
    1 Cor. 2:4).
6.  **Confidence of faith** (1Sa 17:46). David has no doubt as to the
    issue of the battle. Mark his confidence. “The Lord will deliver
    thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee.” Faith’s confidence is
    not born of self-assertion, but is begotten by the sure word of God.
    Since we have a “sure word” (2 Peter 1:19), we have every right to
    say “we are sure” (John 6:69).
7.  **Resource of faith** (1Sa 17:47). “The battle is the Lord’s.” Faith
    recognises that the battle is not its own but the Lord’s, and what
    foe can stand against Him? The resource of faith is the Almighty
    God. The Power of faith lies in the Power which faith lays hold of.
8.  **Victory of faith** (1Sa 17:49-51). When the man of faith takes the
    stone of Christ’s victory over evil, and puts it in the sling of
    Divine utterance, and slings it in the strength of the Holy Ghost,
    it will bring down any foe. The Christian should never expect
    defeat, but always count upon the victorious Lord for complete and
    continual victory.

# 108. David, King over Israel

II. SAMUEL 5:1-12

*David as king over Israel*. There is a sevenfold characteristic of
David as king.

1.  He was an **appointed** *king*: “The Lord said to thee” (2Sa. 5:2).
    He did not seek the office, but he was sought for the position (1
    Samuel 16:11-13). The same is true of Christ. He was God-sent in His
    work (John 3:17-18), God-qualified for the work (Luke 4:18), and
    God-honoured in the position He occupies (Psalm 2:7). The blessed
    man of Psalm 1 is the honoured man of Psalm 2.
2.  David was a **kinsman** *king*. He was no foreigner imported for the
    place, but was one of the people. “We are thy bone and flesh” (2Sa.
    5:1). He was one of their race, and not a stranger. This was
    according to the righteous rule of Deut. 17:15. Christ also is one
    of us. “He was one of us,” was on a banner at the centenary of
    Stevenson. So we say of Christ, “He was one of us.” He is our
    kinsman (Heb. 2:14).
3.  David was a **fitted** *king*. “Thou leddest out,” &c. (2Sa. 5:2).
    He had proved himself worthy of the position. “All through his past
    life, since the conflict with Goliath, David had showed generalship,
    wisdom, skill, forbearance, courage, knowledge of men, and trust in
    God.” How much more so is Christ! He was fitted by His sufferings
    (Heb. 2:10), and His whole life further demonstrates His fitness to
    be the Ruler of men. Psalm 72 is a prophetic statement of His reign
    in the days to come.
4.  David was a **careful** *king*. “Thou shalt feed,” &c. (2Sa. 5:2).
    Literally, “Thou shalt *shepherd*.” The metaphor expresses the care
    the ruler should have in reigning over his people. “The true king
    seeks not to obtain all he can from the people, but to do all he can
    for them; not to plunder the sheep, but to shepherd them.” Psalm 23
    is the expression of the shepherdly care of Christ for His people.
5.  David was an **exemplary** *king*. “Thou shalt be a captain” (2Sa.
    5:2). Not only to lead Israel in time of war, but to be the leader
    in every good word and work. Christ is our Great Leader, and it is
    to Him we are to look (Heb. 12:2-3), of Him we are to learn (Matt.
    11:29), and after Him we are to follow (Mark 8:34).
6.  David was a **victorious** *king*. The Jebusites thought they were
    absolutely secure from the power of David, but they soon found out
    their mistake (2Sa. 5:6-9). Christ is the Great Victor over all foes
    (Luke 11:22; Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15; Rom. 16:20).
7.  David was the **accepted** *king*. Israel desired him to be their
    king, and anointed him as such. Christ is yet to be the acknowledged
    King on this earth (Isaiah 32:1).

The kingship of David may not only be taken in a typical sense, as
applicable to Christ; but as an illustration of the believer’s
conquering rule over himself (Proverbs 16:32), in the power of the
Spirit (Phil. 2:13).
# 109. David's Threefold Anointing

DAVID was three times anointed as king.

1.  First among his brethren in secret by **Samuel**, at God’s direction
    (1 Sam. 16:13).
2.  Second, David was owned as king by **Judah** (2 Sam. 2:4).
3.  Third, he was anointed as king “over all **Israel**” (2 Sam. 5:3).

This threefold anointing of David as king, is typical of the threefold
crowning of Christ. He is “crowned with glory and honour,” as man now
(Heb 2:9). He will reign over the house of Israel, when He is
acknowledged by Israel, and sits on David’s throne (Luke 1:31-33); and
He will yet be “King of kings, and Lord of lords” (Rev. 19:16). All
powers are to be under His power and to submit to His sway (1 Cor.
15:24-28).
# 110. Days of Scripture

1.  **The Day of Jesus** (John 8:56). The Day of Jesus is the *day of
    His humiliation*. It is of interest to note that the human name
    “Jesus” occurs twenty times in John 8:That day is *past*.
2.  **The Day of Man** (1 Cor. 4:3, R.V., margin). “Man’s Day” is this
    present time, when man is acting after his own natural desire, and
    according to the god of this age (2 Cor. 4:4, R.V. M.).
3.  **The Day of Salvation.** “The Day of Salvation” (2 Cor. 6:2) runs
    parallel with man’s day, for it is the desire of God that those who
    will come out from the ranks of the world should be saved by faith
    in Christ.
4.  **The Day of Christ.** “The Day of Christ” begins with Christ coming
    for His people, and ends with His coming with them (Phil. 1:6, 10;
    2:16; Eph. 4:30).
5.  **The Day of the Lord.** “The Day of the Lord” begins with the
    Lord’s coming with His people, and extends to the end of the
    millennium. Mark the expressions in the Old Testament, “the day of
    the Lord”; “in that day.”
6.  **The Day of Judgment.** “The Day of Judgment” for the wicked dead
    is at the end of the millennium, as described in Rev. 20:11-15. See
    Matt. 10:15; 11:22, 24; 12:36; Rom. 2:5; Jude 6.
7.  **The Day of God.** “The Day of God” is eternity (2 Peter 3:12),
    when God will be all in all (1 Cor. 15:28).

# 111. Death of Christ

1.  THE death of Christ is the *record* of the **greatest sin** that was
    ever committed (Acts 2:23).
2.  The *exhibition* of the **greatest love** that was ever seen (Rom.
    5:8).
3.  The *manifestation* of the **greatest victory** that was ever
    achieved (Heb. 2:14).
4.  The *introduction* of the **greatest force** that has ever operated
    (1 John 3:16).
5.  The *unlocking* of the **greatest problem** that has ever engaged
    man’s attention (1 Peter. 1:11).
6.  The *supply* of the **greatest incentive** that has ever been given
    (2 Cor. 5:14).
7.  The *making known* of the **greatest example** we can ever imitate
    (Eph. 5:2).

\




# 112. Death of Christ

THE cross of Calvary was ever casting its terrible shadow across the
path of Christ. It is interesting and instructive to mark Christ’s
repeated reference to His death.

The death of Christ is-

1.  The **testimony** to man’s sin (Acts 2:23).
2.  The **triumph** of God’s grace (Heb. 2:9).
3.  The **trysting place** where God and the sinner **can meet** (1
    Timothy 2:5-6).
4.  The **title** to eternal life (John 12:24).
5.  The **temple** for refuge (Heb. 9:12-14).
6.  The **teacher** for instruction (Tit. 2:11-12).
7.  The **tether** for binding (Gal. 2:20).

# 113. Degrees of Faith

1.  **No** faith. “How is it that ye have no faith?” (Mark 4:40).
2.  **Little** faith. “O ye of little faith” (Matt. 16:8).
3.  **Great** faith. “O woman, great is thy faith” (Matt. 15:28).
4.  **So great** faith. “I have not found so great faith” (Matt. 8:10).
5.  **Full** of faith. “Full of faith and of the Holy Ghost” (Acts 6:5).
6.  **Weak** in faith. “And be ye not weak in faith” (Rom. 4:19).
7.  **Strong** in faith. “Was strong in faith, giving glory to God”
    (Romans 4:20).

\




# 114. Deity of Christ

1.  GOD the Father **affirmed** it. “This is My beloved Son, in whom I
    am well pleased” (Matt. 3:17).
2.  Christ **proclaimed** it. “Tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the
    Son of God.” “Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said” (Matt. 26:63-64;
    Mark 14:61-62).
3.  The angel **asserted** it to Mary. “That holy thing, which shall be
    born of thee, shall be called the Son of God” (Luke 1:35).
4.  John the Baptist **announced** it. “And I saw, and bare record that
    this is the Son of God” (John 1:34).
5.  A legion of demons **knew** it. “What have we to do with Thee,
    Jesus, Thou Son of God?” (Matt. 8:29).
6.  The disciples were **sure** of it. “Of a truth Thou art the Son of
    God” (Matt. 14:33).
7.  The Roman centurion **avowed** it. “Truly this was the Son of God”
    (Matt. 27:54).
8.  The blind man by his action **owned** it. “He said, Lord, I believe”
    (John 9:35-38).
9.  Unclean spirits **acknowledged** it. “Thou art the Son of God” (Mark
    3:11).
10. The Eunuch **believed** it. “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
    of God” (Acts 8:37).
11. Paul **preached** it. “He preached Christ in the synagogues, that He
    is the Son of God” (Acts 9:20).
12. Peter **confessed** it. “Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the
    Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matt. 16:16).
13. The Evangelists **declared** it. “The beginning of the Gospel of
    Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).
14. Nathaniel **professed** it. “Nathaniel answered and said unto Him,
    Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God” (John 1:49).
15. The apostle **wrote** of it. “These are written, that ye might
    believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God” (John 20:31).
16. The Holy Spirit **confirmed** it. “Declared to be the Son of God
    with power, according to the Spirit of Holiness” (Rom. 1:4).

# 115. Deliverance

THE believer has a sevenfold deliverance for which he can praise God:—

1.  Deliverance from the **curse** of a broken law (Gal. 5:1).
2.  Deliverance from the **condemnation** of sin (Romans 8:1-3).
3.  Deliverance from the **servitude** of sin (Rom. 6:18).
4.  Deliverance from the **evil** in the world (Gal. 1:4).
5.  Deliverance from the **power** of darkness (Col. 1:13).
6.  Deliverance from the **fear** of death (Heb. 2:15).
7.  Deliverance from **self** in the death of Christ (Gal. 2:20).

\




# 116. “Deliver Us from Evil”

MATTHEW 6:13

1.  DELIVER us from an “**evil conscience**” (Heb. 10:22) by the
    application of the blood of Christ.
2.  Deliver us from an “**evil heart of unbelief**” (Heb. 3:12), by
    unwavering faith in God’s Word.
3.  Deliver us from “**this present evil world**” (Gal. 1:4), by living
    in the purpose Christ had, when He died for us.
4.  Deliver us from “**evil speaking**” (Eph. 4:31), by enabling us to
    speak the truth in love.
5.  Deliver us from “**every evil work**” (2 Tim. 4:18), by leading us
    in the Spirit to abound in every good work.
6.  Deliver us from “**evil communications**” (1 Cor. 15:33), by heart
    fellowship with Christ and those who are His.
7.  Deliver us from “**all appearance of evil**” (1 Thess. 5:22), that
    Christ’s honour may be unsullied.

# 117. Diligence

EACH of the evangelists bears testimony to the diligence of the women in
coming early to the sepulchre. Matthew says, “They came, at the end of
the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.”
Luke, “They prepared their spices, and rested on the Sabbath, and came
early the next day.” John, “They came the first day of the week when it
was yet dark” (Matt. 28:1; Luke 24:1; John 20:1). It is only those who
do things diligently and promptly that do things well.

See what the Lord says the Christian is to do diligently.

1.  **Unity.** “*Endeavouring* to keep” (Eph. 4:3).
2.  **Study.** “*Study* to shew thyself,” &c. (2 Tim. 2:15).
3.  **Rest.** “Let us *labour* to enter” (Heb. 4:11).
4.  **Calling.** “Give *diligence* to make,” &c. (2 Peter 1:10).
5.  **Watchfulness.** “Be *diligent* that ye may be found,” &c. (2 Peter
    3:14).
6.  **Business.** “Not slothful in *business*” (Rom. 12:11).
7.  **Consecration.** “Giving all *diligence*” (2 Peter 1:5).

The italicised words denote that they are one and the same in the Greek.

\




# 118. “Disciple, Whom Jesus Loved”

WE will briefly refer to the Scriptures in John’s Gospel where the
“beloved disciple” so mentions himself, as illustrating the attitude and
action of love in relation to our Beloved on whom we are leaning—not
only upon His arm, but *Himself* (Sgs 8:5).

1.  **Rest** of love (Jhn. 13:23).
2.  **Confidence** of love (Jhn. 13:25).
3.  **Object** of love (Jhn. 18:15).
4.  **Unity** of love (Jhn. 18:16).
5.  **Contemplation** of love (Jhn. 19:26).
6.  **Obedience** of love (Jhn. 19:27).
7.  **Concern** of love (Jhn. 20:2).
8.  **Companion** of love—zeal (Jhn. 20:3).
9.  **Activity** of love (Jhn. 20:4).
10. **Belief** of love (Jhn. 20:8).
11. **Witness** of love (Jhn. 20:25).
12. **Sharp-sightedness** of love (Jhn. 21:7).
13. **Close companionship** of love (Jhn. 21:20).
14. **Wonderful** memory of love (Jhn. 21:23).
15. **Testimony** of love (Jhn. 21:24).

# 119. Doors

AN old writer has said, “The Holy Spirit rides in the chariot of His
Word.” If, therefore, we would have the Spirit of the Word, we must
ponder the Word of the Spirit. The following references to some of the
doors of Scripture present a complete ring of truth, in which are found
seven precious gems.

1.  **Sin**. Sin at the door.-“Sin lieth at the *door*” (Gen. 4:7). To
    have sin call at the door like a beggar is bad enough, but to have
    it lying there like a wild beast is worse.
2.  **Substitution**. Blood on the door.-“Take of the blood, and strike
    it on the two side posts, and on the upper *door* post of the
    houses” (Exodus 12:7). “Christ our Passover sacrificed for us,”
    proclaims Him, who has suffered in our stead, and who shelters us in
    consequence.
3.  **Salvation**. Passing over the door.-“The Lord will pass over the
    *door*” (Exodus 12:23). Lowth’s translation is very suggestive, “The
    Lord will spring forward before the *door*.” Since He stands between
    us and danger we are safe indeed.
4.  **Security**. Preserved behind the door.-“The *door* of the ark…the
    Lord shut him in” (Gen. 6:16; 7:16). When the Lord shuts the door
    none can open it. It is significant that the first time the Hebrew
    word for atonement is translated, it is rendered “*pitch*” in
    connection with the ark (Gen. 6:14). Christ is our Atonement to
    secure.
5.  **Sanctification**. Nailed to the door.-“Bring him to the *door*”
    (Exodus 21:6). The freed slave out of love to his master has his ear
    bored with an awl to the door (see margin of Ps. 40:6; and Isaiah
    50:5).
6.  **Sentry**. Sentinel before the door.-“Keep the *door* of my lips”
    (Psalm 141:3). If the Lord preserves the lips, no enemy shall open
    them to His dishonour, nor our shame.
7.  **Station**. “Waiting at the posts of My *doors*” (Prov. 8:34). The
    believer’s attitude is that of prayerful expectancy, and faithful
    watching.

\




# 120. Downgrade-ism of Asa

II. CHRONICLES xvi

WHEN anyone gets on the incline of backsliding, he soon finds himself in
the road of departure from God. Thus it was with Asa; one step in the
wrong direction prompted him to take another.

1.  **Asa sought help in the wrong quarter** (2Ch 16:2). Instead of
    going to the King of Syria for help, he should have gone to the King
    of Heaven. The man who looks to man for assistance is cursed (Jer.
    17:5), but he who looks to the Lord is helped indeed (Psalm 121:2).
    The help of man, like water in a leaky vessel, is sure to run away,
    whereas the help of the Lord is like a mighty tornado, before which
    nothing can stand.
2.  **Asa relied on the wrong person for aid** (2Ch 16:7). The king was
    but as a broken reed for Asa to lean upon; no wonder, therefore,
    that he came to the ground to his hurt. To rely on the Lord is to
    have the arm of the Living God to uphold us, as Asa had experienced
    when he trusted in the Lord on a previous occasion (2Ch 16:8). To
    trust in the Lord is the *secret* of a holy life (Gal. 2:20); the
    *spur* to a separate life (Heb. 11:8-9); the *stimulus* to a useful
    life (Heb. 11:7); the *stay* of a suffering life (Heb. 11:24, 25);
    the *staple* to a tempted life (1 John 5:4); the *success* of a
    courageous life (Gideon: Heb. 11:32); and the *safe-guard* of an
    active life (Paul: 1 Tim. 4:10).
3.  **Asa was angry with the wrong man** (2Ch 16:10). He should have
    been angry with himself; instead of that, he was wroth with the
    prophet. They that are wrong are the first to do wrong.
4.  **Asa’s oppression was in the wrong place** (2Ch 16:10). He should
    have oppressed himself by heartfelt penitence and confession;
    instead of that he acted the part of a tyrant in crushing some of
    the people.
5.  **Asa consulted the wrong physician** (2Ch 16:12). “He sought not
    the Lord” is a sad sentence to have against one’s name. It tells out
    a life of self-will and self-reliance.

# 121. Ebed-melech

JEREMIAH 38:& xxxix

IN the darkest page of history there is a gleam of sunshine, and in the
chapters before us we have a bright illustration of the Gospel.

1.  As the princes got Jeremiah put into the miry pit, so sin has placed
    us in the pit of iniquity and unbelief (Psa. 40:2).
2.  As Ebed-melech sought to rescue Jeremiah from the pit, and to save
    him from the death of starvation (Jeremiah 38:7-9), so Christ has
    died and acted for us, to deliver us from the wrath to come (1
    Thess. 1:10).
3.  As Ebed-melech acted according to the word of the king, so Christ
    has acted according to the word of God (John 17:4).
4.  As Ebed-melech provided means to rescue Jeremiah (Jer. 38:11), so
    the Lord has decreed that those who are saved shall bear His message
    of salvation to others (John 20:21).
5.  As Jeremiah was saved from the miry pit by acting according to the
    instructions that were given to him (Jer. 38:12), so we are saved by
    doing as the Lord directs (John 5:24).
6.  As Jeremiah was assured by the king that he should not be put to
    death (Jer. 38:16), so the Lord assures us that we shall never
    perish (John 10:28-29).
7.  As Ebed-melech was rewarded because of his trust in the Lord (Jer.
    39:16-18), so all those who trust in Christ are rewarded with all
    spiritual blessings in Him (Eph. 1:3).

# 122. Endurance

BELIEVERS are called to endure-

1.  **Hardness.** As good soldiers. “*Endure* hardness as a good soldier
    of Jesus Christ” (2 Tim. 2:3).
2.  **Affliction.** As workers. “*Endure* afflictions, do the work of an
    evangelist” (2 Tim. 4:5).
3.  **Chastening.** As children. “If ye *endure* chastening, God dealeth
    with you as with sons” (Heb. 12:7).
4.  **Grief.** As Christians. “For this is thankworthy, if a man for
    conscience toward God *endure* grief” (1 Peter 2:19).
5.  **Contradiction.** Partners with Christ. “Consider Him that
    *endured* such contradiction of sinners against Himself” (Heb.
    12:3).
6.  **Temptation.** Tried ones. “Blessed is the man that *endureth*
    temptation” (James 1:12).
7.  **All things.** Elect’s sake. “Therefore I *endure* all things for
    the elect’s sake” (2 Tim. 2:10).

\




# 123. Esau

GENESIS 25:27-32

ESAU represents a man of the world, and Jacob a man of God, although
there are blemishes in his life.

As a man’s countenance will often reveal the course of life he is
leading, so the several sentences that speak of Esau indicate what kind
of a character he was.

1.  **The cunning hunter.** “Esau was a cunning hunter” (Gen. 25:27). He
    was no novice in the art of hunting, but he was an adept. By
    continually giving himself to this pleasure he had become an expert.
    This indicates at once, that he is a typical character of those who
    are wholly given over to the pursuits and pastimes of the pleasures
    of this evil age.
2.  **The man of the field.** “A man of the field” (Gen. 25:27). From
    this we gather he was a man of wild and lawless habits, one who did
    not care to be under the restraint of home, but one who liked his
    own will and way.
3.  **The thoughtful son.** “Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his
    venison” (Gen. 25:28). From Gen. 27:1-2, we gather that Esau was
    willing to minister to his father’s wants in obtaining venison for
    him. It has often been found that those who are not godly have kind
    and thoughtful traits in their character. It was kind of Esau to
    satisfy Isaac, whether it was wise for Isaac to want the venison,
    and thus to keep his son roaming.
4.  **The fainting sportsman.** “Esau came from the field, and was
    faint” (Gen. 25:29). Trapp well remarks upon Esau’s faintness while
    in pursuit of pleasure: “Of carnal pleasures a man may break his
    neck sooner than his fast. Nor is it want of variety in them, but
    inward weakness, or the course of unsatisfyingness, that lies upon
    them. The creature is now as the husk without the grain, the shell
    without the kernel, full of nothing but emptiness; and so may faint
    us, but not fill us.”
5.  **The stamped individual.** “Esau said to Jacob, feed me, I pray
    thee, with that same red *pottage*; for I am faint: therefore his
    name was called Edom” (Margin, “red,” Gen. 25:30). Men have by their
    actions made their name to be identical with some special sin; hence
    to mention the name of some men is at once to bring up their sin.
    Judas is identified with covetousness, Eli with parental weakness,
    Jeroboam with idolatry, Simon Magus with simony, Korah with pride,
    and Esau with profanity (Heb. 12:16).
6.  **The thoughtless questioner.** “What profit shall this birthright
    do to me?” (Gen. 25:32). Of what use can a birthright be to a man at
    the point of death? Esau says, in so many words, “I prefer present
    gratification to deferred privileges.” Thus it was with the rich man
    mentioned in Luke 16; he lived for the present while on earth, and
    he lived to repent his folly in hell.
7.  **The bad bargainer.** “Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
    birthright” (Hebrews 12:16). The birthright meant a double portion
    of his father’s property (Deut. 21:17); it meant authority over his
    brethren (Genesis 27:29; 49:3), and the right to the priestly
    office. The first-born of Israel were replaced by the Levites (Num.
    3:12). Esau did indeed despise the birthright by selling it for a
    mess of pottage. There are many to-day who are selling their eternal
    interests by living for self, living in sin, following the pleasure
    of the world and the desires of the flesh. What profit can these
    things give in this life? How will these things look on the
    death-bed, and in the coming eternity?

    Cor. 4:17).
10. We shall dwell in **eternal Tabernacles.** “Receive you into
    everlasting habitations” (Luke 16:9).
11. We are aiming to have an abundant entrance into the **eternal

    eateth My flesh…hath eternal life” (John 6:53-54).

    that they might know Thee and Jesus Christ” (John 17:3).

# 132. Faith

THE eleventh of Hebrews might be called the Westminster Abbey of the
Bible, for it is a series of memorials to the trials and triumphs of
faith.

There is no mention of the failures of the Old Testament saints in
Hebrews 11, for the simple reason that God had said, “Their sins and
iniquities will I remember no more” (Heb. 10:17).

1.  **Wisdom of faith** (Heb. 11:1-2). Faith makes unseen things real,
    and future things present. Faith rests on facts, hence its wisdom.
    Presumption acts on its own authority, hence its folly. Newberry
    renders the words, “Evidence of things not seen,” as follows:
    “conviction of facts not seen.”
2.  **Warrant of faith** (Heb. 11:3). The ground of faith’s attitude and
    action is, “Thus saith the Lord.” “Where the word of a king is,
    there is power” (authority).
3.  **Worship of faith** (Heb. 11:4). The *ground* of worship is
    sacrifice (Heb. 10:19-22); the *object* of worship is God (Rev.
    22:9); and the *power* of worship is the Holy Spirit (Eph. 2:18).
4.  **Walk of faith** (Heb. 11:5-6). The walk of faith is illustrated by
    the three men who are said to have walked with God.
    -   Fellowship with God-Enoch (Gen. 5:24).
    -   Fidelity to God-Phinehas (Mal. 2:6; Num. 25:12-13).
    -   Faith in God-Noah (Gen. 6:9).

5.  **Witness of faith** (Heb. 11:7). As unbelief and disobedience are
    synonymous terms, so are faith and obedience. It was because Noah
    was a man of faith that he obeyed God’s direction, hence his
    witness.
6.  **Wandering of faith** (Heb. 11:8-10). As a stranger and pilgrim,
    Abraham went forth at God’s bidding. It was because he looked for a
    city that he dwelt in a tent.
7.  **Waiting of faith** (Heb. 11:11-12). Those who have the promise of
    God can afford to be patient before God. Waiting time is not wasted
    time. We must learn to “tarry” (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4), if we would
    triumph.

# 133. Faith

HEBREWS 11:13-22

1.  **Trust of faith** (Heb. 11:13). The promises are received as bank
    notes, which are as good as cash. Mark the words, “received,”
    “persuaded,” “embraced,” “confessed.”
2.  **Telescope of faith** (Heb. 11:13). Unbelief says, “Seeing is
    believing,” but faith says, “Believing is seeing.” The promises are
    “seen afar off,” but they are *seen*.
3.  **Testimony of faith** (Heb. 11:14-16). Faith declares by its
    actions what its aim is. “Came out” declares the separation of the
    man of faith; and the “wherefore” the consequent blessing.
4.  **Trial of faith** (Heb. 11:17-19). Faith looks at God’s presence
    and power, when tried. If the Lord does not deliver us *out* of the
    trial, He will be *with* us in it.
5.  **Thoughtfulness of faith** (Heb. 11:20). Faith looks not on its own
    things, but looks out for others.
6.  **Tact of faith** (Heb. 11:21). Faith’s reverses are God’s
    directions. Ponder the words “blessed” and “worshipped” in the light
    of Gen. 48:17-21.
7.  **Tranquility of faith** (Heb. 11:22). The thought of the future
    fills the man of unbelief with fear; but the man of faith can speak
    of the future with perfect calm.

# 134. Faith

HEBREWS 11:32

1.  **Success of faith,** as illustrated in Gideon (Judges 6).
2.  **Song of faith,** as depicted in Barak (Judges 5:6, &c.).
3.  **Strength of faith,** as seen in Samson (Judges 13:2, &c.).
4.  **Sacrifice of faith,** as unfolded in Jephthah (Judges 11:1, &c.).
5.  **Supplication of faith,** as manifest in David (Psalms).
6.  **Singleness of faith,** as made known in Samuel.
7.  **Subject of faith,** as demonstrated in the prophets.

Ponder the “wherefore” of Heb. 12:1, and observe how the Holy Spirit
directs our gaze to the Man of Faith, for He is the Prince and Pattern
of faith (not “*our*” faith, but of faith. The word “*our*” is in
italics). Christ was the One who began, continued, and ended His life in
simple confidence; hence we are bidden to look to Him as the Perfect
Example of what faith in God accomplishes.
# 135. Faith
“THE AIM AND ATTITUDE OF FAITH”

JOSHUA 6:8-20

1.  **THE place** of faith. “Before the Lord” (Josh. 6:8; Phil. 2:12).
2.  The **testimony** of faith. “Blowing with the trumpets” (Josh. 6:9;
    1 Thess. 1:8).
3.  The **attitude** of faith. “Until I bid you” (Josh. 6:10; Col. 2:6).
4.  The **rest** of faith. “Lodged in the camp” (Josh. 6:11; 1 John
    2:28).
5.  The **activity** of faith. “Rose early.…..…took up” (Josh. 6:12;
    Jas. 2:22-26).
6.  The **continuance** of faith. “Went on continually” (Josh. 6:13-14;
    John 8:31).
7.  The **perfection** of faith. “Seven times” (Josh. 6:15; 1 Thess.
    3:10).
8.  The **boldness** of faith. “Shout” (Josh. 6:16; Acts 4:13).
9.  The **assurance** of faith. “The Lord hath given” (Josh. 6:16; 1
    John 5:10-11).
10. **The recognition** of faith. “Devoted (margin) to the Lord” (Josh.
    6:17; 1 Pet. 3:5).
11. The **separation** of faith. “Keep yourselves from the accursed
    thing” (Josh. 6:18; 2 Cor. 7:1).
12. The **service** of faith. To bring the consecrated things “into the
    treasury of the Lord” (Josh. 6:19; 1 Cor. 6:20).
13. The **triumph** of faith. “The wall fell down flat” (Josh. 6:20; 1
    John 5:4-5).
14. The **possession** of faith. “They took the city” (Josh. 6:20;
    Genesis 22:17).

Thus we have in miniature what faith is, what faith brings, and what
faith does.
# 136. Faith

HEBREWS 11:23-31

1.  **Courage of faith** (Heb. 11:23). The declarations of God are
    always to be regarded before the decrees of man.
2.  **Choice of faith** (Heb. 11:24-26). Pleasures of sin are always
    renounced for the pleasures of God’s right hand; and the treasures
    of earth are abandoned for the treasures of heaven.
3.  **Calmness of faith** (Heb. 11:27). When we know what it is to look
    into the face of God, we shall never fear the frown of man.
4.  **Covering of faith** (Heb. 11:29). The blood of atonement is
    faith’s protection, and the presence of God is its confidence
    (Exodus 12:13, 23).
5.  **Confidence of faith** (Heb. 11:29). The Word of God was Israel’s
    authority for crossing the Red Sea; hence the confidence they had.
6.  **Conflict of faith** (Heb. 11:30). “The battle is the Lord’s,” is
    the war-cry of faith.
7.  **Confession of faith** (Heb. 11:31). Rahab’s action proclaims her
    faith.

# 137. Faith

FAITH in God may be compared to many things.

1.  Faith is the **hand** that receives the gift of God, and makes us
    rich (John 1:12).
2.  Faith is the **eye** that looks into the unseen, and beholds things
    which are beyond human ken (Heb. 11:1).
3.  Faith is the **heart’s response** to the call of the Lord (Rom.
    10:10).
4.  Faith is the **soul’s reliance** on the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Timothy
    1:12).
5.  Faith is the **link** that connects with Christ and God (Heb.
    10:22).
6.  Faith is the **wire** along which the electricity of God’s power
    runs and communicates itself to us (Gal. 3:5).
7.  Faith is the **operator** which causes the feet to run in glad and
    swift obedience, as is illustrated in Israel’s marching round
    Jericho according to the Divine direction (Heb. 11:30). Obedience is
    the proof of faith. Where there is no obedience there is no faith.
    Therefore if we would triumph, we must obey.\
    -   “To trust and obey,\
         There is no other way.”

    Or to put it more correctly,\
    -   “To trust is to obey.”


# 138. Faithful Servant

1.  A  FAITHFUL servant of Christ is **holy in life.** “Be ye followers
    of me even as I also am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1).
2.  He has the **truth of God** as the authority of his utterance. “The
    truth of Christ is in me” (2 Cor. 11:10).
3.  The **unsearchable riches of Christ** are the theme of his
    preaching. “To preach…the unsearchable riches of Christ” (Eph. 3:8).
4.  The **love of Christ** is his constraining power. “The love of
    Christ constraineth us” (2 Cor. 5:14).
5.  The **power of Christ** is his strength. “That the power of Christ
    may rest upon me” (2 Cor. 12:9).
6.  The **work of Christ** is his joy. “For the work of Christ he was
    nigh unto death” (Phil. 2:30).
7.  To **please Christ** in his ambition. “If I yet pleased men, I
    should not be the servant of Christ” (Gal. 1:10).
8.  He recognises that he has to stand before the **judgment seat of
    Christ**. “We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ”
    (Rom. 14:10).

\




# 139. Faithfulness of God

1.  HE is *faithful* that called us unto the fellowship of His Son. “God
    is faithful, by whom ye were called” (1 Cor. 1:9).
2.  He is *faithful*, and will not suffer us to be tempted above what we
    are able to bear (1 Cor. 10:13).
3.  The Lord is *faithful* to sanctify us wholly. “The very God of peace
    sanctify you wholly” (1 Thess. 5:23).
4.  He is *faithful* to stablish and keep. “The Lord is faithful, who
    shall stablish you, and keep you from evil” (2 Thess. 3:3).
5.  His own character the ground of His faithfulness. “If we believe
    not, yet He abideth faithful; He cannot deny Himself” (2 Tim. 2:13).
6.  He is *faithful* to keep to His promises. “He is faithful that
    promised” (Heb. 10:23).
7.  He is *faithful* to forgive, if we confess our sins. “If we confess
    our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive” (1 John 1:9).

\




# 140. Feasts of Jehovah

THERE are seven feasts mentioned in the twenty-third of Leviticus, all
of which are typical, and especially shadow forth, in a brief way, the
events from the cross to the glory.

1.  The **Passover** is typical of Christ our Passover sacrificed for us
    (1 Cor. 5:7).
2.  The **Unleavened Bread** of the holy life of the believer (1 Cor.
    5:8).
3.  The **Firstfruits,** of the resurrection of Christ (1 Cor. 15:23).
4.  **Pentecost,** of the coming of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4).
5.  The **Trumpets,** of the coming of Christ (1 Thess. 4:16).
6.  The **Day of Atonement,** of the time when the Jews shall see Christ
    as their Atonement (Zech. 12:10).
7.  The **Feast of Tabernacles,** of the rest and peace of the
    millennium (Isaiah 11).

# 141. Feeding the Five Thousand

MARK 6:30-44

CHRIST is the Pivot of Scripture. Take Christ away from the Scripture,
and everything falls into confusion. See Christ in the Scripture, and
the Key is found to unlock every difficulty, and solve every problem.

1.  **Gathered to Jesus.** “The Apostles gathered themselves together
    unto Jesus” (Mark 6:30). As Abraham came back to Bethel (The House
    of God, Gen. 13:3), and as Israel returned to Gilgal (The rolling
    away, Josh. 5:9), the place where the reproach of Egypt was rolled
    from them, after their battles with their enemies (Josh. 10:43), so
    the Apostles gathered to Christ. They could not leave Him (John
    6:68). He was the centre and circumference of their being.
2.  **Speaking with Jesus.** “Told Him” (Mark 6:30). To have the ear of
    Jesus to listen to our words, is to have the hand of Jesus to bless
    us in our work. Prayer is the *key* to open the storehouse of
    blessing (Matt. 15:25-28), the *eye salve* to open the eyes (2 Kings
    6:17), the *harbinger* of peace (Phil. 4:6-7), the *swift messenger*
    in temptation (Eph. 6:18), the *encourager* in persecution (Neh.
    4:9), the *dynamo* for power (Acts 4:31-33), and the *succourer* of
    others (Acts 12:5).
3.  **Invited by Jesus.** “He said: Come,” &c. (Mark 6:31). The
    disciples were so busy that they had neither time to eat, nor
    leisure to commune with Christ. It is possible to be occupied with
    work for Christ, and lose sight of the Christ of the work. There
    should be the activity of Martha without her anxiety, blended with
    the attention of Mary and her restfulness; but the Mary character
    must precede the Martha. *We must go inside the veil to worship,
    before we go outside the camp to work*.
4.  **Running after Jesus** (Mark 6:33). The people were determined not
    to lose sight of Christ. So anxious were they to see and hear Him,
    that they “ran” after Him. O that every Christian was as desirous to
    keep Christ in view! Let the prayer of the bride be ours, namely,
    “Draw me, we will run after Thee” (Sgs 1:4). If we are drawn we
    shall draw someone else, as is indicated in the change of the
    singular pronoun “*me*” to the plural “*we*.”
5.  **Compassion of Jesus** (Mark 6:34). Christ has the compassion of a
    *Shepherd* to find (Matt. 9:36); the compassion of a *Provider* to
    supply (Matt. 15:32); the compassion of a *Healer* to give sight
    (Matt. 20:34); the compassion of a *Cleanser* to cleanse (Mark
    1:41); the compassion of *Power* to deliver (Mark 5:19); the
    compassion of a *Deliverer* to emancipate (Mark 9:22, 25); the
    compassion of a *Comforter* to console (Luke 7:13); the compassion
    of a *Father* to love (Luke 15:20); and the compassion of God to
    bless. Note the five times God is said to be “full of compassion” in
    Psalms 78:38; 86:15; 111:4; 112:4; 145:8.
6.  **Instruction from Jesus.** “He began to teach them many things”
    (Mark 6:34). We are not told what the “many things” were that Jesus
    taught the people. Doubtless He would teach them what they *were*,
    namely, sheep without a shepherd (Isa. 53:6); and what He *was*,
    viz., the Good Shepherd seeking the wandering sheep (Luke 15).
7.  **Directed by Jesus** (Mark 6:37). The Lord Jesus bids His disciples
    to give the multitude to eat. In like manner believers now are
    bidden to care for the hungry (Heb. 13:16), and, above all, to
    supply famishing beings with the Gospel of the Bread of Life.
8.  **Questioned by Jesus.** “How many loaves have ye?” The Lord asks
    for what the disciples have got, and uses what they have to
    accomplish His purpose. “What is that in thine hand?” (Ex. 4:2) was
    the question that the Lord put to Moses, and through that rod God
    did wondrous things. In like manner, if we only place ourselves and
    what we have at the disposal of the Lord, He can multiply and use
    them to His glory and others’ good.
9.  **Commanded by Jesus.** “He commanded them to make all sit down”
    (Mark 6:39-40). There must be quiet and order before Christ can meet
    the need of the people. In like manner there must be *quietness
    before the Lord* (Psalm 62:1, margin), and a *willingness to receive
    from the Lord* (John 1:12), before there can be *satisfaction in the
    Lord* (Psalm 16:2, R.V.).
10. **Look of Jesus.** “He looked up to heaven” (Mark 6:41). That look
    of faith expresses His absolute dependence on His Father. What an
    Example for us! If we look to heaven before our actions, we shall be
    guided as to our actions, and in them.
11. **Blessing of Jesus** (Mark 6:41). The blessing of Jesus made the
    bread to multiply to the satisfying of the need of the people.
    Verily the blessing of the Lord maketh rich (Proverbs 10:22). *The
    blessing of His grace* will make us rich unto salvation (Eph.
    2:6-8); *the blessing of His sanctification* will make us holy in
    life (1 Cor. 1:30); *the blessing of His strength* will make us
    strong to endure in the time of trial (2 Cor. 12:9); and *the
    blessing of Himself will meet every need* (Col. 2:10).
12. **Action of Jesus** (Mark 6:41). Jesus “brake” the bread before He
    gave. In like manner His body was broken and bruised in death for
    us, before the blessing of His grace came to us.
13. **Gift of Jesus** (Mark 6:41). As Christ gave the bread to the
    disciples to give to the multitude, so the Word of the Gospel is
    committed to believers to give to the unsaved (2 Cor. 5:19-20).
14. **Divided by Jesus.** “Divided He among them all” (Mark 6:41). The
    Lord saw that everyone got his portion. He overlooked none. He acts
    in the same way now. His desire is to bless, “whosoever” (John 3:16)
    “any man” (John 10:9).

# 142. Fervour of the Holy Spirit

IF we are all on fire with the fervour of the Holy Spirit, we shall
kindle a flame in the souls of others. It is because there is so little
fervour, that there is the great lack of moving power in the world. The
late William Arnot used to tell of his being at a railway station, where
he grew weary of waiting for the train to move. He inquired if the
trouble was the want of water. “Plenty of water” was the prompt reply,
“but it’s no bilin’.” That’s the trouble in the Church, and with the
individual Christian. What we want is-

1.  **Fervency** in prayer (James 5:16).
2.  **Enthusiasm** in service (Acts 17:6).
3.  **Boldness** in testimony (Acts 4:13).
4.  **Constrainment** in work (2 Cor. 5:14).
5.  **Spending** in toil (2 Cor. 12:15).
6.  **Graciousness** in life (Acts 6:8, R.V.).
7.  **Spirit-filledness** in heart (Eph. 5:18).

# 143. Fire

WHAT does fire represent?

1.  **The presence of God.** “And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,
    because the Lord descended upon it in fire” (Ex. 19:18).
2.  **Righteouness of God.** “From His right hand went a fiery law for
    them” (Deut. 33:2).
3.  **Judgment of God.** The Lord shall trouble thee this
    day . . . . and burnt them with fire” (Josh. 7:25).
4.  **Favour of God.** “The fire came down from heaven and consumed the
    burnt offering” (2 Chron. 7:1).
5.  **Word of God.** “His word was in my heart as a burning fire” (Jer.
    20:9).
6.  **Protection of God.** “For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a
    wall of fire round about” (Zech. 2:5).
7.  **Searching of God.** “And I will bring the third part through the
    fire and will refine them as silver is refined” (Zech. 13:9).

\




# 144. Firstfruits

1.  FIRSTFRUlTS of **resurrection.** “Become the *firstfruits* of them
    that slept” (1 Cor. 15:20).
2.  Firstfruits of the **Spirit.** “Which have the *firstfruits* of the
    Spirit” (Rom. 8:23).
3.  Firstfruits of the **redeemed.** “We should be a kind of
    *firstfruits* of His creatures” (James 1:18).
4.  Firstfruits of **Israel.** “If the *firstfruits* be holy,” &c. (Rom.
    11:16).
5.  Firstfruits of **Achaia.** “That it is the *firstfruits* of Achaia”
    (1 Cor. 16:15).
6.  Firstfruits of **Asia.** “Who is the *firstfruits* of Achaia unto
    Christ” (Rom. 16:5).
7.  Firstfruits unto **God** and the **Lamb.** “Being the *firstfruits*
    unto God and to the Lamb” (Rev. 14:4).

\




# 145. First Things First

WHAT the Lord says should be put first, should be followed, for He knows
best.

1.  **Seeking.** “Seek ye *first* the kingdom of God” (Matt. 6:33).
2.  **Cleansing.** “Cleanse *first* that which is within” (Matt. 23:26).
3.  **Reconciling.** “*First* be reconciled to thy brother (Matt. 5:24).
4.  **Casting.** “*First* cast out the beam out of thine own eye” (Matt.
    7:5).
5.  **Shewing.** “*First* to shew piety at home (1 Tim. 5:4).
6.  **Partaking.** “ Husbandman…*first* partaker of the fruits” (2 Tim.
    2:6).
7.  **Delivering.** “I delivered unto you *first* of all,” &c. (1 Cor.
    15:3).

# 146. Following Christ

“FOLLOW Me” (John 12:26) is Christ’s command, after we have believed in
Him. We should follow Him-

1.  **Willingly,** as a sheep (John 10:27).
2.  **Wholly,** as a servant (John 12:26).
3.  **Patiently,** as a sufferer (1 Peter 2:21).
4.  **Heartily,** as a saved one (Mark 10:52).
5.  **Promptly,** as a disciple (Luke 5:11, 28).
6.  **Constantly,** as a loving one (John 21:20).
7.  **Imitatingly,** as a child of God (Eph. 5:1).

\




# 147. Following the Lord

1.  *Whom* we are to follow (2 Thess. 3:7; 1 Peter 2:21).
2.  *Why* we are to follow (John 8:12).
3.  *How* we are to follow-
    -   As believers, *fully*, like Caleb (Num. 14:24).

        4:16).
    -   As servants, *obediently* (John 12:26).
    -   As sheep, *attentively* (John 10:27).

    -   As saved ones-*Jesus only*, like Bartimaeus (Mark 10:52).
    -   As His friends, *willingly* (Mark 15:41).
    -   As suffering ones, *consistently* (1 Peter 2:21).
    -   As loved ones, *lovingly* (1 Cor. 14:1).
    -   As apprehended ones, *apprehendingly* (Phil. 3:12).
    -   As righteous ones, *righteously* (1 Tim. 6:11).

\




# 148. “Forget Not”

1.  **Person.** “*Forget not* the Lord” (Deut. 8:11).
2.  **Provocation.** Forget not past failure. “*Forget not* how thou
    provokedst the Lord thy God” (Deut. 9:7).
3.  **Prayer.** Forget not the poor. “*Forget not* the congregation of
    Thy poor for ever (Psalm 74:19).
4.  **Punishment.** Forget not thine enemies. “*Forget not* the voice of
    Thine enemies” (Psalm 74:23).
5.  **Praise.** Forget not benefits. “*Forget not* all His benefits”
    (Psalm 103:2).
6.  **Practice.** Forget not commandments. “*Forget not* My law, but let
    thine heart keep My commandments” (Prov. 3:1).
7.  **Pleasing God.** Forget not to do good. “But to do good and to
    communicate *forget not*” (Heb. 13:16).

# 149. Forgiveness

1.  **Unmerited** forgiveness. “When they had nothing to pay, He frankly
    *forgave* them both” (Luke 7:42).
2.  **Divine** forgiveness. “To the Lord our God belong mercy and
    *forgivenesses*” (Daniel 9:9).
3.  **Purchased** forgiveness. “In Whom we have redemption through His
    blood, the *forgiveness* of sins” (Eph. 1:7).
4.  **Free** forgiveness. “That they may receive *forgiveness* of
    sins . . . . by faith that is in Me” (Acts 26:18).
5.  **Full** forgiveness. “Having *forgiven* you all trespasses” (Col.
    2:13).
6.  **Practical** forgiveness. “*Forgive* us our debts, as we *forgive*”
    (Matthew 6:12).
7.  **Known** forgiveness. “Your sins are *forgiven* you for His name’s
    sake” (1 John 2:12).

\




# 150. For Him

1.  As the **Branches** to bear fruit for Him. “Herein is My Father
    glorified, that ye bear much fruit” (John 15:8).
2.  As **Lights** to shine for Him. “Let your light so shine before men”
    (Matt. 5:16).
3.  As **Witnesses** to testify for Him. “Ye are witnesses of these
    things” (Luke 24:48).
4.  As **Servants** to serve for Him. “The servant is not greater than
    his Lord” (John 13:14-17).
5.  As **Pilgrims** to abstain for Him. “As strangers and pilgrims,
    abstain from fleshly lusts” (1 Peter 2:11).
6.  As **Soldiers** to fight for Him. “Endure hardness, as a good
    soldier of Jesus Christ” (2 Tim. 2:3).
7.  As **Workmen** to work for Him. “Son, go work to-day in my vineyard”
    (Matt. 21:28).

\




# 151. Found

FOUND *by* Him a *sinner* (Matt. 13:44).\
 Found *in* Him a *saint* (Phil. 3:9).\
 Found *of* Him a *servant* (2 Peter 3:14).

1.  **Found by Him a sinner.** This reminds us what we *were*, and what
    we *are* in ourselves. When He found us we were *guilty* (Lev. 6:5,
    margin) because we had sinned; He found us as the woman did the
    piece of silver, *dead* and helpless (Luke 15:9); He found us as the
    shepherd did the sheep, *far away from God*, and *unable* to get
    back (Luke 15:4-6); He found us in a *desert place*, that is, in the
    *world* (Deut. 32:10); He found us *asleep, unconscious* of the
    danger we were in (Matthew 26:43); He found us like the fig tree,
    when He looked for fruit, nothing but leaves (Matt. 21:19). But
    blessed be His name, *He found us* and brought us to Himself, and we
    are precious to Him, as the treasure was to the man who found it in
    the field.
2.  **Found in Him a saint.** This reminds us of what we *are*, that is
    being in Christ, we *are* sanctified, accepted, and complete in Him;
    but it also reminds us that being in Him, as a stone in the
    building, as a member of His body, as a branch in the vine, the
    outward fact of this will be seen by the very life of Christ being
    manifested in our life.
3.  **Found of Him a servant.** This reminds us of Him as the coming
    Lord (see Luke 19:13) when He returns to reward His servants for
    work done for Him. How careful we should be as to the material we
    are building upon the foundation, and see to it that we are not
    building the wood of man’s intellect, the hay of that which is
    pleasing to the imagination of the fleshly man, or the stubble of
    nothingness, giving no food to those to whom we go; but be careful
    that we are building on the foundation, the gold of divine
    righteousness, the silver of the atonement, and the precious stones
    of the glory, for our work will be tried as to its *quality*, not
    its *quantity*. If not successful, may we be faithful
    servants-faithful in walk and work-then we shall receive the
    Master’s “Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the
    joy of thy Lord.”

\




# 152. Four Good Workers

“Borne of four” (MARK 2:3).

FOUR men bringing one to Christ. We are not told who these men were, nor
where they came from, but their action is recorded in the imperishable
Word of God. These four men may be taken as an illustration of four
things that are essential in seeking to bring others in contact with
Christ: namely, prayer, faith, sympathy, and perseverance.

1.  **Prayer.** Prayer is the hand that opens the door of heaven, and
    lets out the power of God. The prayer of faith, and the Spirit of
    God, are linked together like the yoked oxen that are ploughing in
    the field. “When they had prayed the place was shaken where they
    were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy
    Ghost” (Acts 4:31). There is so little power in the Church, because
    there is so little prayer.
2.  **Faith.** “When Christ saw their faith He said unto the sick,” &c.
    (Mark 2:5). If prayer is the hand that opens the door of blessing,
    faith is the hand that receives the blessing, and not for itself
    merely, but for others. This is not the only instance in the gospels
    where Christ blessed others for the faith’s sake of the one pleading
    on their behalf. The Syro-Phenecian woman’s daughter was healed for
    her mother’s faith’s sake (Matt. 15:28), and the centurion and his
    servant is another case in point (Matt. 8:10).
3.  **Sympathy.** If the wind of declamation is blown upon any soul, it
    but makes that one draw the cloak of indifference around him, but if
    the sun of Christian sympathy, the compassion of Christ, beams upon
    the unsaved one, he will soon throw off the cloak of indifference,
    and open up his mind to you (see AEsop’s fable of the wind and the
    sun).
4.  **Perseverance.** I saw a fishing-boat recently sailing up Loch
    Strivven in Scotland, but it had to tack as the wind was against it.
    So often in Christian work the unsaved will raise a wind of
    objections, let us not give up in consequence, but use the
    objections as helps, and thus perseveringly use our opponents to
    attain our desired end.

# 153. Four “If So Be's”

1.  **Indwelling.** “*If so be* that the Spirit of God dwell in you”
    (Rom. 8:9). “If so be.” Ah! here we have the secret, the test of the
    whole matter. If a man lives after the flesh, whatever colour it may
    assume, it is because he is self-centred, self-controlled, and
    self-aiming; but if a man lives after the spirit, in all the
    instincts of that holy nature, it is because the Spirit of God, in
    His consecrating love, controlling grace, and conforming power,
    lives in him.
2.  **Resurrection.** The apostle, by the Holy Spirit, in speaking of
    the result if Christ is not raised from the dead, says, “We are
    found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that
    He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, *if so be* that the dead
    rise not” (1 Cor. 15:15). It is a proof that Christ is not raised
    from the dead if the dead rise not.
3.  **Love for the Word.** Again, we find the words, “*if so be*” in
    relation to the Christian life. One result of Christ in the life is
    a love for the Word of God, and this love for the Word is an
    evidence that we know the Lord of the Word. As Peter says, “As
    new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word…*if so be* ye
    have tasted that the Lord is gracious” (1 Peter 2:2-3).
4.  **Suffering.** We read in Romans 8:17: “And if children, then heirs,
    heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; *if so be* that we suffer
    with Him, that we also may be glorified together.” The goal of glory
    is by the path of suffering, and there is no glory but by this path.
    From the use of the words it will be gathered that the secret of the
    believer being able to rise above the flesh is found in the
    indwelling presence of the Spirit of God; and if a professed
    believer does not walk according to the Spirit, it is because he has
    not the Holy Spirit; hence he does not belong to the Lord Jesus,
    however loud his profession may be.

# 154. Fourteen Appearings of Christ after His Resurrection

THERE are no less than *fourteen* recorded appearings of Christ before
Paul wrote to the Church of Corinth, and fifteen if we include Christ’s
manifestation to John in the Isle of Patmos. The fourteen appearings are
as follows:—

1.  To **Mary Magdalene** (John 20:14; Mark 16:9).
2.  To the other **women** (Matt. 28:9).
3.  To **Peter** (1 Cor. 15:5; Luke 24:34).
4.  To the **two disciples** on their way to Emmaus (Mark 16:12-13; Luke
    24:13-32).
5.  The day He appeared to the **disciples,** in the absence of Thomas
    (John 20:19-24).
6.  To the **disciples** when Thomas was present (John 20:24-29).
7.  In Galilee, at the sea of Tiberias, to **Peter, John, Thomas, James,
    Nathanael,** and two **others** (John 21:1-14).
8.  To the **disciples** on a mount in Galilee (Matt. 28:16).
9.  To more than **five hundred brethren** at once (1 Cor. 15:6).
10. To **James** the apostle (1 Cor. 15:7).
11. To all the **apostles** assembled together (1 Cor. 15:7).
12. To all the **apostles** at His ascension (Luke 24:50-51; Acts
    1:9-10).
13. To **Stephen**, when he was being stoned to death (Acts 7:56).
14. To **Paul** (1 Cor. 15:8; Acts 9:3-5; 22:6-10).

Such a mass of evidence attesting any given fact would be accepted as
proof positive as to its validity in any court of justice.
# 155. Fruit Bearing

THE evidence of union with Christ is fruit bearing (John 15), and where
there is no fruit there is no union, and no union means no life.

1.  **Fruit of the Spirit.** Love. “The *fruit* of the Spirit is love”
    &c. (Gal. 5:22).
2.  **Fruit of Righteousness.** Uprightness. “Filled with the *fruits*
    of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:11).
3.  **Fruit of Holiness.** Separation to God. “Being made free from sin,
    and become servants unto God, ye have your *fruit* unto holiness”
    (Rom 6:22).
4.  **Fruit of our lips.** Thanksgiving. “Let us offer the sacrifice of
    praise to God continually, that is, the *fruit* of our lips” (Heb.
    13:15).
5.  **Fruit in Work.** Consistency. “Walk worthy of the Lord, being
    *fruitful* in every good work” (Col. 1:10).
6.  **Fruit of Work.** Conversion and Consecration. “That I might have
    some *fruit* among you” (Rom. 1:13).
7.  **Fruit of Generosity.** Ministering to others. “I desire *fruit*
    that may abound to your account” (Phil. 4:17).
8.  **Fruit unto God.** God’s object in saving. “Bring forth *fruit*
    unto God” (Rom. 7:4).

# 156. Fruit of the Spirit

GAL. 5:22-23

1.  **Love** is the source of obedience. “If a man love Me, he will keep
    My words" (John 14:23).
2.  **Joy** is the flower of holiness. “Righteousness, peace, and joy in
    the Holy Ghost" (Rom. 14:17).
3.  **Peace** is the outcome of trustfulness. “Be careful for
    nothing…and the peace of God" (Phil. 4:6-7).
4.  **Long-Suffering** is the wife of patience. “With long-suffering,
    forbearing one another in love" (Eph. 4:2).
5.  **Gentleness** is the daughter of love. “Gentle, shewing all
    meekness unto all men" (Titus 3:2).
6.  **Goodness** is the activity of grace. “To do good and to
    communicate forget not" (Heb. 13:16).
7.  **Faith** is the faithfulness of courage. “This is the victory that
    overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4).
8.  **Meekness** is the lesson learned from Christ. “Learn of Me, for I
    am meek and lowly" (Matt. 11:29).
9.  **Temperance** is the mastery of faith. “Add to faith.….temperance"
    (2 Peter 1:5-6).

# 157. Fulness of Supply

WHEN Christ gave His disciples a draught of fishes He gave them such a
supply that the boats were *filled* (Luke 5:6-7). Christ never gives
with a niggardly hand. There is sure to be an overplus when He gives.
When He fed the people there were basketsful over.

1.  He gives “*fulness* of **blessing**” to enrich us (Romans 15:29).
2.  *Fulness* of **Grace** to bless us (John 1:16).
3.  *Fulness* of **Joy** to gladden us (John 15:11).
4.  *Fulness* of the **Spirit** to empower us (Eph. 5:18)
5.  *Fulness* of **God** to sanctify us (Eph. 3:19; Col. 1:19; 2:9).
6.  *Fulness* of **Faith** to assure us (Heb. 10:22).
7.  *Fulness* of **Himself** to satisfy us (Eph. 4:13).

# 158. Gathered Together

THE “Gathered togethers” of Scripture are associated with the fellowship
of God’s saints.

1.  Gathered together in **sorrow** (Luke 24:33).
2.  Gathered together for **worship** (Matt. 18:20).
3.  Gathered together for **discipline** (1 Cor. 5:4).
4.  Gathered together for **testimony** (Acts 14:27).
5.  Gathered together in **service** (Ezra. 3:1; Neh. 8:1).

# 159. “Gave Himself For”

THERE are seven places in the New Testament where the words “Gave
Himself for,” are distinctly associated with Christ’s substitutionary
work. In each case the Greek preposition, “*Huper*,” translated “*for*,”
occurs. “*Huper*” means to act on behalf *of another*, *as acting in the
stead of him*, in other words *a substitute*.

Why did Christ die?

1.  To **pay** the ransom price. “*Gave Himself* a ransom *for* all” (1
    Tim. 2:6).
2.  To **bear** our sins. “*Gave Himself for* our sins” (Gal. 1:4).
3.  To **stand** in our place. “*Gave Himself for* me” (Gal. 2:20).
4.  To **have** us for Himself. “*Gave Himself for* it” (Eph. 5:25).
5.  To **make** us acceptable to God. “*Given Himself for* us, an
    offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour” (Eph.
    5:2).
6.  To **redeem** us from all iniquity. “*Gave Himself for* us, that He
    might redeem us from all iniquity” (Titus 2:14).
7.  To **remind** us of our obligation to Him. “This is *My* body which
    is *given for* you” (Luke 22:19-20).

# 160. Genesis 28:15

1.  **Presence in loneliness.** “I am with thee” (Matt. 28:20).
2.  **Preservation in danger.** “Will keep thee” (John 17:11-12; 1 Peter
    1:5).
3.  **Protection at all times.** “In all places” (John 13:1).
4.  **Promise fulfilled.** “Will bring thee again into this land” (John
    14:3).
5.  **Perpetual companionship.** “I will not leave thee” (Heb. 13:5).
6.  **Perseverance in blessing.** “Until I have done,” &c. (Phil. 1:6).

# 161. Gift of the Holy Spirit

ACTS 2

THERE are four distinct gifts mentioned in the New Testament.

1.  The *gift* of **Christ**, by God, to the world (John 3:16).
2.  The *gift* of the **Church**, by the Father, to Christ (John 17:6).
3.  The *gift* by the **believer**, of himself, to God, for His
    occupation, use, and service (2 Cor. 8:5).
4.  The *gift* of the **Holy Spirit**, by Christ, to those who believe
    in Him (John 1:33; Acts 2:38).

Let us note a few characteristics of the latter.

1.  **It was a Promised Gift.** If we look back to the parting words of
    Christ, as recorded in John 14:16, we shall see that he spoke again
    and again of “The Comforter,” whom He would send to take His place
    and carry on His work. It is well to remember that the Holy Spirit
    is *not* an influence, but a Person. His personality is most clearly
    taught by Christ, and also the diversity of His operation is most
    significant in the revelation of Christ concerning Him.
2.  **He is a Powerful Gift** (Acts 2:2-4, 37). The power of the Spirit
    is seen in the two similes used, “wind” and “fire”; and in the
    result produced, in that 3,000 were pricked to the heart and
    converted. The power of the Spirit is most marked in the change He
    made in the disciples. They were turned from cowardice to courage.
    Filled with the Spirit, there will be power to witness for Christ.
3.  **He is a Peculiar Gift** (Acts 2:5-13). The multitude could not
    understand what made the difference in the disciples, and as they
    heard them, there was one of two results. Some were “amazed,” and
    others “mocked.” *A man who is filled with the Holy Spirit will be a
    marked one.* The devil will seek to overthrow him, and men will
    scoff at him.\
     The peculiar features of the Holy Spirit are-He is *holy*,
    *loving*, *true*, and *righteous*; and those who possess Him are
    like Him; hence those who are not in possession of Him, do not like
    Him or His.
4.  **He is a Prophetic Gift** (Acts 2:14-21). The Jews need not have
    wondered. We wonder that they should wonder, for they should have
    known their own Scripture, and have been expecting the fulfilment of
    its prophecies. Note the two “I wills” in Acts 2:17-18. The “I will”
    tells us of the certainty of the promise; and the “pouring out” of
    the sufficiency of the promise. The “pouring out” suggests another
    emblem of the Holy Spirit, viz., water.\
     The following five “**I will pour**” illustrate the above:—
    -   Salvation (Prov. 1:23).
    -   Satisfaction (Isaiah 44:3).
    -   Speaking (Joel 2:28).
    -   Supplication (Zech. 12:10).
    -   Superabundance (Mal. 3:10, margin).

5.  **Purchased Gift** (Acts 2:22-36). These verses describe the person
    and work of the Lord Jesus, and one of the consequences of His
    atoning work, namely, the gift of the Holy Spirit. It was Jesus in
    resurrection power who said to His disciples, “Receive ye the Holy
    Ghost” (John 20:22).
6.  **The preliminary to receiving the Gift** (Acts 2:38). Repentance
    towards God precedes the reception of the Holy Spirit. Repentance is
    taking God’s side against one’s self, as the publican did when he
    condemned himself in God’s presence. Repentance is a change of mind
    wrought by the Holy Spirit, and shewn in the action. Repentance is
    opening the door to the Holy Spirit. Receiving the Spirit is to
    allow Him to come in and take possession of the house.
7.  **Proclaimed Gift** (Acts 2:41-47). They proclaimed the gift in the
    following way:—
    -   Confessing the Lord in baptism (Acts 2:41).
    -   Communing with the Lord’s people. Note the words “fellowship,”
        “together,” “all,” “one accord.”
    -   Continuing in the truth of God, and in oneness with each other
        (see Acts 2:42-46).
    -   Consecration of all to the Lord (Acts 2:45).
    -   Praising God (Acts 2:47).
    -   Additions to the Church of God (Acts 2:47).


# 162. Glorious Protection

WE may take the meaning of the names of the Cities of Refuge as
illustrating the protection that Christ gives, and the kind of refuge
Christ is (Num. 35; Josh. 20, 21)

1.  “**Kedesh.**” Kedesh means holy or separated. Christ is a Holy
    Refuge, and He is made such to His people (1 Cor. 1:30).
2.  “**Shechem.**” Shechem means shoulder, or strength. Christ is a
    Strong Refuge. No shot of the enemy can pierce Him, He is
    impregnable (Ps. 18:2).
3.  “**Hebron.**” Hebron means company, or fellowship. Christ is a
    Living Refuge, with whom we have been called to have fellowship (1
    Cor. 1:9).
4.  “**Bezer.**” Bezer means strong, or a stronghold. Christ is a Secure
    Refuge. Nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:39), no one
    can condemn us (Romans 8:34), and no one can take us from our hiding
    place (Col. 3:3).
5.  “**Ramoth.**” Ramoth means high, or high places. Christ is a High
    Refuge. We are made to sit with Him in heavenly places (Ephesians
    2:6).
6.  “**Golan.**” Golan means a circle, or enclosed. Christ is a Perfect
    Refuge. The Lord has hedged His people in, on every side (Job 1:10).

# 163. Glory of Jesus

1.  The *glory* of His **Holiness** is seen in His life (Heb. 7:26).
2.  The *glory* of His **grace** is seen in His dealings with sinners
    (Luke 7:47).
3.  The *glory* of His **love** is seen in His Cross (Gal. 2:20).
4.  The *glory* of His **compassion** is seen in His weeping over
    Jerusalem (Luke 19:41).
5.  The *glory* of His **power** is seen in His miracles. Think of what
    He 999:He raised the dead (Matt. 9:25; Luke 7:11-17; John 11:44); He
    healed the sick (Matt. 4:24); He opened the eyes of the blind (Matt.
    9:27-30); He unstopped deaf ears (Mark 7:32); He unloosed stammering
    tongues (Matt. 9:33); He fed five thousand and more from five barley
    loaves and two small fishes (John 6:9-10); He stilled the tempest
    (Mark 4:39); He cast out demons (Mark 5:1-20); He cleansed the
    lepers (Matt. 8:2-4); He straightened the crooked (Luke 13:11-13);
    He turned water into wine (John 2:7-10); and He rose from the dead
    (2 Cor. 5:15).

# 164. “Go”

THERE are several commands that are associated with the monosyllable
“*go*” which we may take to illustrate the commands of Christ.

1.  **Power.** “*Go* in this thy might” (Judges 6:14).
2.  **Prayer.** “In Thy name we *go* against this multitude” (2
    Chronicles 14:11).
3.  **Progress.** “*Go* forward” (Exodus 14:15; Psalm 84:7).
4.  **Practice.** “*Go* and do thou likewise” (Luke 10:37).
5.  **Proclamation.** “*Go* tell this people” (Isaiah 6:9; Acts 28:26).
6.  **Perseverance.** “*Go* out into the highways,” &c. (Luke 14:21-23;
    Matt. 22:9).
7.  **Presence.** “My presence shall *go* with thee” (Ex. 33:14).

# 165. God's Care for His People

1.  He **watches** over them with His eyes (Psalm 34:15).
2.  He **listens** to their prayers with His ears (1 Peter 3:12).
3.  He **instructs** them by His word (Deut. 33:3).
4.  He **loves** them with His heart (1 John 3:1).
5.  He **supports** them by His hands (Hosea 11:3).
6.  He **kisses** them with His lips (Canticles 1:2).
7.  He **leads** them by His Spirit (Romans 8:14).
8.  He **encourages** them by His promises (2 Peter 1:4).

# 166. God's Charge to Abram

GENESIS 17:1.

There are three reasons why the Lord charges Abram to walk before Him.

1.  **Because of past failure.** For thirteen years it seems that Abram
    had been walking before Sarah in listening to her, and following her
    advice with reference to Hagar. When Ishmael was born, Abram was
    eighty-six years old (Gen. 16:16), and he was ninety-nine years old
    when the Lord appeared and gave him the charge to walk before Him.
    As A. Fuller says, “This admonition implies a serious reproof. It
    was like saying, ‘Have no more recourse to unbelieving expedients;
    keep in the path of uprightness, and leave Me to fulfil My promise
    in the time and manner that seem good to come!’” What a lesson is
    here afforded us, never to use unlawful means under the pretence of
    being more useful, or promoting the cause of God. Our part is to
    walk before Him, and be upright, leaving Him to work out His own
    designs in His own way.
2.  The Lord charges Abram to walk before Him, **because He commands
    it.** Where the word of a king is, there is authority. I know a
    little boy who, when he is told to do a certain thing, says to his
    father, “What for?” and the reply he receives is, “Because I tell
    you.” It is quite sufficient when the Lord tells us to do anything,
    to do it without questioning.
3.  The Lord bids Abram to walk before Him, **because of what He is.**
    “I am the Almighty God.” The meaning of the words “*El Shaddai*,”
    translated “Almighty God,” is the Irresistible One, who is able to
    make and destroy. It is the name that expresses God’s Almightiness,
    by which He was specially made known to the patriarchs (Exodus 6:3).
    The title occurs six times in Genesis (17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 43:14;
    48:3; 49:25), and thirtyone times in the book of Job. Some have
    derived *Shaddai* from Shad a nipple, because God feeds His children
    with sufficiency of all good things, as the loving mother doth the
    child with the milk of her breasts. Hence we might speak of God in
    His all-sufficiency as “The Many-Breasted God.” There is no lack
    with Him, therefore we may well count upon supplies from Him. What
    does it mean to walk before God? (1) To live as in His sight, and
    under His inspection. (2) To realize at all times His presence and
    His providence. (3) To feel the dignity of the godly life. We are
    not to walk behind Him as if ashamed, but before Him, as conscious
    of the dignity of our high calling. (4) To feel the constant energy
    of spiritual life. The light of God’s countenance is upon us, and in
    that we have life. We cannot fail with the Almighty power behind us.
    (5) To feel the love of God towards us. Unless there was redeeming
    love on God’s part, it would be impossible for us to walk before
    Him. In *that* alone our souls can live and move. (6) To apprehend
    God’s love by our faith. This is that power in the soul that lays
    hold of the Divine fulness. Hence “the just shall live by faith.”

# 167. God's Covenant with Abram

GENESIS 17:2

“I WILL make my covenant” (Gen 17:2). The covenant had already been
given (Gen. 15:18), but it is here ratified and enlarged. This covenant
was unconditional. It has a threefold fulfilment as to the seed. (1) In
Abram, being the father of many nations. “To the Jew, the Moslem, and
the Christian alike, the prophet Abraham is a common ancestor. Trace
these three forms of belief to their fountain-head, and they meet in the
tent of that ancient confessor.” (2) In Christ being the “Son of
Abraham” (Matt. 1:1), for He was the promised “seed,” as Paul says in
speaking of the promise given by God to Abram, “He saith not, and to
seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ”
(Gal. 3:16). (3) In the believer in Christ, for they who believe in
Christ are said to be blessed with believing Abram, and to be his
spiritual children. “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed”
(Gal. 3:29).

Notice the six “*I wills*.”

The “I will” of *Covenant* (Gen 17:2).

The “I will” of *Fruitfulness* (Gen 17:6).

The “I will” of *Creation* (Gen 17:6).

The “I will” of *Establishing* (Gen 17:7).

The “I will” of *Gift* (Gen 17:8).

The “I will” of *Relationship* (Gen 17:8).
# 168. God's Judgment on Sodom

GENESIS 18:22-33

THE Holy Jehovah, the ministry of angels, the pleading of Abraham, the
wrong position of Lot, the lingering wife of Lot, and filthy Sodom, are
brought out in the following:—

1.  **The Lord answers the prayers of His people on behalf of others.**
    One of the bright points in Abraham’s life is his pleading on behalf
    of Sodom. His prayer is a model one. (1) It was the prayer of a man
    who was *right* with the Lord. Abraham “stood before the Lord” (Gen
    18:22). To stand before the Lord is to act as in His presence (Lev.
    24:4), and to be conscious of being right with Himself (1 Kings
    17:1). (2) It was the prayer of a man who was in *intimate communion
    with the Lord.* “Abraham drew near” (Gen 18:23). We must draw near
    to God in the full assurance of faith if we would have His ear (Heb.
    10:22). (3) It was a *bold* prayer. Abraham begins to question the
    Lord (see verses 23-25). We may come “boldly” to the throne of grace
    (Heb. 4:16), but we may not come rudely. (4) It was a *humble*
    prayer (Gen 18:27). Cross out the words in italics-*am*, *but*.
    While he confesses that he is “dust and ashes,” he is more than
    this, for he is an indestructible spirit, therefore to say he is
    “*but* dust and ashes” is not true, though to say he is “dust and
    ashes” is to express his utter abasement of himself. (5) The prayer
    was *persevering*. Abraham does not stop at one answer, but asks
    again and again. God’s blessings, while they satisfy, create an
    appetite, and cause us to ask for more. (6) The prayer was
    *answered*. God gave Abraham all he asked. Abiding in Christ, we
    have a similar opportunity, for He says, “Whatsoever we ask,” &c.
    (John 14:13; 15:7). (7) The prayer was *limited*. Young says, “Ought
    not six gracious answers to have strengthened the faith of the
    suppliant rather than exhausted it. Who can tell whether, if he had
    asked that the cities should be spared even for Lot’s sake, the
    request would not have been answered?” Trapp also remarks upon
    this-”Abraham bucked with the Lord so long, till he had brought Him
    down from fifty to ten; and mark that he left begging ere God left
    bating. Let us find praying hearts, and He will find a pitying
    heart.”
2.  **God takes note of what is going on in the world.** Sin has a voice
    which cries to God for vengeance, as when the blood of Abel spilt by
    Cain called for punishment (Gen. 4:10), and as in the case of Sodom
    (Gen. 18:20). The sin of Sodom was *excessive* (Gen. 13:13);
    *grievous*, *great* (Gen. 18:20); *bitter* (Deut. 32:32); *open*
    (Isaiah 3:9; Gen. 19:5); *hateful* (Jer. 23:14); it was spoken of
    ever afterwards as being most abominable to the Lord, and called for
    severest measures upon those who were guilty of like iniquity (Deut.
    23:17; 1 Kings 14:24; 15:12; 22:46; Jude 7). There are some who seem
    to act as if God took no note of what they were doing, but He surely
    does. Not a single thing escapes His notice, for He not only notes
    the actions of men, but weighs them as well (1 Sam. 2:3). Two
    children were playing in a room together. A plate of sweet cakes was
    brought in and laid upon the table. “Oh, I want one of those cakes!”
    cried the little boy, jumping up as soon as his mother left the
    room, and going on tip-toe towards the table. “No, no,” said his
    sister, pulling him back, “You must not touch.” “Mother won’t know
    it; she did not count them,” he cried, shaking her off, and
    stretching forth his hand. “If she didn’t, God counted,” answered
    the sister. Yes, God counts, as Job says, “Doth not He see my ways,
    and count all my steps?” (Job 31:4).
3.  **God punishes sinners for their sins.** The Dead Sea to-day is a
    silent and solemn witness to this fact, and the overthrow of Sodom
    is proverbial of God’s righteous action against sin (Deut. 29:23;
    Is. 13:19; Jer. 49:18; 50:40; Amos 4:11; Luke 17:29; 2 Peter 2:6;
    Jude 7). The French proverb on punishment is suggestive-”Punishment
    is the recoil of crime; and the strength of the backward stroke is
    in proportion to the original blow.” “Whatsoever a man soweth, that
    shall he also reap” (Gal. 6:7). If the farmer sows tares he does not
    expect wheat, neither can a sinner expect anything but punishment if
    he continues and dies in a course of sin.

# 169. God's Creative Acts Typical of His New Creation

1.  **Darkness upon the Waters.** “Darkness was upon the face of the
    deep” (Gen. 1:2). This is typical of the state of the sinner in the
    darkness of sin, ignorance, and unbelief. The purpose of the Gospel,
    as Christ told Paul, is to “turn them from darkness to light” (Acts
    26:18).
2.  **The Spirit moving upon the Waters.** “And the Spirit of God moved
    upon the face of the waters” (Gen. 1:2). This shadows forth the work
    of the Holy Spirit in regeneration; even as Peter, in reminding us
    of what the Lord has done for us, says, “Who hath called you out of
    darkness into His marvellous light” (1 Peter 2:9).
3.  **The Light shining forth.** “God said, Let there be light, and
    there was light” (Gen. 1:3). This reminds us of the light shining
    into the heart by the Holy Spirit, through the Word; in fact, the
    apostle uses it as an illustration of this truth, “God, who
    commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
    hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
    the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Cor. 4:6).
4.  **Life and growth.** “Let the earth bring forth . . . . and the
    earth brought forth grass…herb…tree yielding fruit” (Gen. 1:11-12).
    God said, and then life and fruit followed. So it is with us who
    have heard the voice of God. We have eternal life, and the evidence
    of it is growth in grace, for the command of Christ is very clear.
    “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
    works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).
5.  **Blessing and fruit-bearing.** “And God blessed them, and God said
    unto them, Be fruitful,” &c. (Gen. 1:28). In and by Him we are
    blessed; in Him is our fruit found, and by Him we are fruitful. This
    is the result of fellowship with Him, for “if we walk in the light,
    as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another” (1 John
    1:7), that is, with the Father and the Son.
6.  **Union and power.** “God said, Let us make man in Our image, after
    Our likeness, and let them have dominion,” &c. (Gen. 1:26). This was
    lost by sin, but, in a spiritual sense, is restored by accepting
    Christ; as Paul reminded the Ephesians, in telling them what they
    were, are, and should be, “Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are
    ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light” (Eph. 5:8).
7.  **Sanctification** (Gen. 2:3). As God set apart the seventh day as a
    day of rest, so He has set apart the believer in Christ for Himself;
    and because he is thus set apart, he is to separate from all that
    is, and those who are not the Lord’s. “For what fellowship hath
    righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light
    with darkness?” (2 Cor. 6:14).

# 170. God's Covenant with Noah

GENESIS 9:1-17

A COVENANT usually means a compact between two parties, delivered in
solemn form, and requiring mutual engagements. As employed in Scripture,
from the nature of the case, it must also be extended to mean God’s
*promise* by which He binds Himself to His creatures without terms,
absolutely (Jer. 33:20; Ex. 34:10). Gesenius derives the term from the
verb “to cut” (Isa. 57:8, margin), as it is a Hebrew phrase “to cut a
covenant,” and it was customary for the purpose of ratifying such, to
divide an animal in parts (Gen. 15:10, 17). Others derive it from the
verb “to eat together,” thus explaining the phrase “covenant of salt”
(Num. 18:19; 2 Chron. 13:5).

1.  **Divine Covenant.** “I, behold, I,” &c. (Gen 9:9). The origin of
    the covenant is in God Himself. He also is the One who undertakes to
    fulfil all the conditions of the covenant. As illustrating this,
    notice how often the Lord uses the pronoun “*I*.”
    -   The “I” of *gift* (Gen 9:3).
    -   The “I” of *requirement* (Gen 9:5).
    -   The “I” of *establishment* (Gen 9:9-11).
    -   The “I” of *making* (Gen 9:12).
    -   The “I” of *setting* (Gen 9:13).
    -   The “I” of *bringing* (Gen 9:14).
    -   The “I” of *remembering* (Gen 9:15-16).
    -   The “I” of *looking* (Gen 9:16).
    -   The “I” of *assuring* (Gen 9:17).

    “Thou shalt” is a command, but no power to perform. “I will” is the
    Lord acting as we trust Him, and fulfilling His own word.
2.  **Sure Covenant.** God assures Noah there shall not “any more” be a
    flood, &c. Note the “any more’s” of Gen 9:11, and the “no more” of
    Gen 9:15. When the Lord says “no more” there is an end to the
    matter, and we may be sure that He will fully fulfil His word. When
    we have a “Thus saith the Lord” for anything we have a rock upon
    which we can build, and no storm can overthrow us. Notice three “no
    more’s” of the New Testament as illustrating: *Atonement* (Heb.
    10:18, 26). *Absolution* (Heb. 10:17; 8:8). *Abiding* (John 15:4).
3.  **Ratified Covenant.** The bow in the cloud is God’s sign and seal
    that He will surely keep to His covenant. God has set the bow of
    Christ’s atonement in the dark cloud of our sin. He has set the bow
    of His consolation in the dark cloud of trial; the bow of His
    promise in the cloud of difficulty; and the bow of His coming again
    in the dark cloud of bereavement. Law says, “How can we render
    thanks enough for this superadded pearl in our diadem of
    encouragements! We are thus led to look for our bow on the cloud of
    every threatening storm. In the world of nature it is not always
    visible; but in the world of grace it ever shines. When the darkest
    clouds thicken around us the Sun of Righteousness is neither set nor
    has eclipse, and His ready smile converts the drops into an arch of
    peace.”
4.  **Extent of the Covenant.** “Every living creature,” &c. (Gen 9:15).
    The covenant extends to “all flesh.” The animal creation was
    destroyed, excepting those who were in the ark, but God says it
    shall not be so again. The animal creation has come under the curse
    of sin, but under Christ and in the Millennium it will be “delivered
    into the glorious liberty of the children of God” (Rom. 8:19-23),
    and the scene depicted in Isaiah 11 shall be literally fulfilled.
5.  **Perpetual Covenant.** “Everlasting covenant” (Gen 9:16), that is,
    to last until it shall be needed no more. We cannot apply the
    adjective “everlasting” to nothing. As long as the covenant is
    needed it is in force. When the conditions that called forth the
    covenant no longer exist, then it can no longer apply. This, which
    would at first sight seem to be against “eternal punishment,” is
    really an illustration of it, for the sinner can never cease to be;
    therefore the punishment (whatever it is) is always applied. How
    comforting it should be to the child of God that he is related to
    the eternal God, saved in an eternal salvation, quickened in an
    eternal life, comforted with eternal consolation, indwelt by the
    eternal Spirit, united to the eternal Saviour, kept for an eternal
    inheritance, and secured by an eternal covenant.

# 171. God's Desire for the Welfare of Men

THE following seven facts speak for themselves, that the Lord desires
the welfare of men:—

1.  The **cross** of Christ declares it (John 3:16).
2.  The **nature** of God asserts it (1 John 4:8-9).
3.  The **invitations** of JESUS affirm it (Mat. 11:28).
4.  The **word** of God reiterates it (John 3:17-18).
5.  The **Spirit** of God repeats it (Rev. 22:17).
6.  The **ambassadors** of the Gospel proclaim it (2 Cor. 5:20).
7.  The **tears** of Christ confirm it (Luke 19:41).

But if men will not have God’s mercy in love, they must have His might
in judgment. He is almighty in grace (Gen. 17:1), but He is also
almighty to punish (Rev. 15:3).
# 172. God's Dwelling-Place (The Tabernacle)

GOD’S dwelling-place in the past eternity was in the high and holy place
(Isa. 57:15). Speaking after the manner of men, God desired another
dwelling-place, and so created man that He might have a companion to
dwell and commune with. Sin came in and separated man from God.
Notwithstanding this, God’s heart went out towards him, for He says, “My
delights were with the sons of men” (Prov. 8:31), and He commanded Moses
to make Him a sanctuary, that He might dwell among them (Ex. 25:8),
which was but a shadow of Him who should come tabernacling among us
(John 1:14, R.V., M.), and having by His own blood put away the
hindrance-sin-and made a way even into the very presence of God, the
sinner can now draw near to God, and God can *dwell in the believer*, on
the ground of the finished work and living Person of our Lord Jesus
Christ.

**What was the Tabernacle made for?**

God Himself gives the answer, “*that I may dwell among you*,” but God
comes nearer than that to us who believe in Him; “*I will dwell in
them*.” This tells us that God dwells not now in any earthly temple of
man’s making, but in the *individual* believer in Christ (1 Cor. 6:19),
and also in the Church as a whole (2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:22). This implies
many truths. Among these we might notice-

1.  **Regeneration by the Spirit of God through the truth.** He it was
    who quickened us from the death of sin, led us to Christ, begot in
    us a new nature, united us to, and made us one in, and with Christ,
    and He now *dwells in* every child of God as the One who witnesses
    to our acceptance, as God’s mark upon us, as the Comforter to cheer,
    as the Teacher to instruct, and as the Indwelling Power, for us, in
    us, and by us to overcome our enemies, to glorify God, and to work
    in us mightily, thus to manifestly show that we are born again.
2.  **Satisfaction in and with Christ.** He says, “He that eateth My
    flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I *in him*” (John
    6:56). The thought here, is our union with Christ and His with us,
    and the satisfaction that flows to Him and to us, because we are in
    Him. What satisfaction it gives us as we remember that we are
    accepted in all the worthiness of the Person and work of Jesus, and
    also that He is in us the hope of glory!
3.  **Relationship to God as our Father.** “I will *dwell* in them.….and
    I will be their God, and they shall be My people.….and will be a
    Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the
    Lord Almighty” (2 Cor. 6:16-18). Here we have God’s relationship to
    us-”Father”-He has sent forth His Spirit in our hearts, crying, Abba
    Father; and we have our relationship to Him-”sons and daughters.”
    Thus the Spirit, Son, and Father *dwell* in us.
4.  **Standing.** “Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be
    that the Spirit of God *dwell* in you. Now if any man have not the
    Spirit of Christ, he is none of His” (Rom. 8:9). We are no longer in
    the first Adam, but we stand accepted in the last Adam, the Lord
    from heaven; and the fact that this is so, is, that the Spirit of
    God dwelleth in us.
5.  **Separation from the world.** “Be ye not unequally yoked together
    with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with
    unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and
    what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
    believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God
    with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God: as God hath
    said, I will *dwell* in them” (2 Cor. 6:14-18). Notice a sevenfold
    contrast here-\
      ------------------ ----- ------------------
      1. Christian       and   Unbeliever.
      2. Righteousness   and   Unrighteousness.
      3. Light           and   Darkness.
      4. Christ          and   Belial.
      5. Believer        and   Infidel.
      6. Temple of God   and   Idols.
      7. Clean           and   Unclean.
      ------------------ ----- ------------------

    Well may Paul ask, what agreement have these one with the other?
    None; therefore there is no other alternative for us but to be
    practically separated from the one to the other.
6.  **Power.** “I will dwell and walk in them.” This is our power. The
    Spirit is in us as our power to pray (Rom. 8:26); He is in us as our
    power to keep (2 Tim. 1:14); He is in us as the source of
    fruit-bearing; He is in us as our power to enable us to walk in
    Christ; He is in us as our power to separate us from the world, and
    our power in work and testimony.
7.  **Resurrection.** “If the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from
    the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from among the dead
    shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His (margin)
    Spirit that dwelleth in you” (Rom. 8:11). By His own almighty power
    shall He quicken our mortal bodies should we die; and if not, by His
    power shall we be caught up to meet Christ, and be changed in a
    moment, and be like Him.

# 173. God's Remembrance

THERE are several things that God is said to remember.

1.  He remembers **His people** (Isaiah 44:21; 49:15).
2.  He remembers **we are dust** (Psalm 103:14).
3.  He remembers **the sparrows** (Luke 12:6).
4.  He remembers **deeds of kindness** (Jer. 2:2).
5.  He remembers **our works** (Amos 8:7).
6.  He remembers **His mercy and truth** (Psalm 98:3).
7.  He remembers **His holy promise** (Psalm 105:42).
8.  He remembers **His covenant** (Lev. 26:42, 45; Deut. 4:31; Ezek.
    16:60; Psalm 105:8, 106:45).

Being God, He cannot forget, but knowing our frailty, He graciously
speaks after the manner of men for our comfort and consolation.

\




# 174. God's Workmen

“THERE were two men who had the oversight in making the tabernacle. The
first was *Bezaleel*, the son of *Uri*, the son of *Hur*, of the tribe
of *Judah*; and the second was *Aholiab*, the son of *Ahisamach*, of the
tribe of *Dan* (Ex. 31:1-6). We want to take these *seven* names and
their meaning as illustrating the secret of success in Christian work in
the divine sense of the word, and also the sort of workers God wants.

1.  **Bezaleel,** which means *in the shadow of God*. If our work is to
    be God honouring, we must be dwelling in the secret place of God’s
    presence.
2.  **Uri,** which means *light of Jehovah*. Living in the light of
    Jehovah, in the light of His word and presence. And the result will
    be that our whole body will be full of light (Matt. 6:22); thus the
    light that has shone into our hearts will shine out in our life in
    work for, and with the Lord (2 Cor. 4:6-7).
3.  **Hur.** This name has a triple meaning-*free-born*, *noble*,
    *white*. *Free-born*. Only those that are born of the Spirit, by the
    Word and through faith in Christ, are made children of God; and as
    such, our Father says to us, “*Son*, go work to-day in My vineyard.”
    *Noble*. As free-born ones our work must be noble, noble in its
    motive-the constraining love of Christ; noble in its object-the
    glory of God. *White*. As free-born noble ones our work must be
    white, no second motives, but pure, holy service to the Lord.
4.  **Judah,** which means *praise*. Working Christians are joyful,
    praising ones. Believers who do not work for the Lord have plenty of
    time to listen to the doubts and fears the devil brings before them;
    but the working Christian is like the busy bee; as it passes from
    flower to flower getting the sweetness out of each, it seems to hum
    its song of praise as it goes buzzing along. So we shall find that
    as we speak to others of the love of Christ, that love will burn in
    our own hearts.
5.  **Aholiab,** which means *tent of my father*. The tent is the symbol
    of separation from the world. As workers we are sent into the world,
    but we are no longer of the world, and no longer is the world in us,
    although we are in the world as a ship is in the water and the water
    not in the ship. If we would have power in service, there must be
    practical separation from all that is worldly, and a confession that
    we are pilgrims and strangers on the earth, and that “our
    citizenship is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour.”
6.  **Ahisamach,** which means *brotherly support*. The secret of
    manifest blessing from God in work done for Him is unity amongst the
    workers. “How can two walk together except they agree?” and this
    applies with equal force to work; there must be unity, brotherly
    support; no bickerings or jealousies, but a real interest in each
    other, and each other’s work; remembering that it is the Lord’s
    work, and that we should rejoice in whomsoever He uses.
7.  **Dan,** which means *judgment*. As to our *persons*, we shall never
    be judged for our sin, because Jesus has borne the judgment for us.
    As *servants*, we shall be judged, that is, our *work*, of what sort
    it is. As *sons*, we are now to judge our *ways* by the Word of God;
    but we are also to judge what sort of work we are building on the
    foundation-which is Christ. If we are building on it the wood of
    vain-glory, loving to be seen of men; the hay of profession and the
    stubble of mixed motive, it will all be burnt up at the judgment
    seat of Christ. But if we build on the foundation, the gold of pure
    motive-the glory of God; the silver power of love, and the precious
    stones of prayerful faith, believing work and loving labour (1 Cor.
    3:11-15), these will stand the fire, and we shall receive the
    Master’s “Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the
    joy of thy Lord.” Thus may we judge our work of what sort it is now,
    and be “stedfast, unmovable, always *abounding* in the work *of the
    Lord*, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the
    Lord” (1 Cor. 15:58).

# 175. God's Written Word

PSALM 119:89-112

WE give an acrostic on the title, as illustrating a few of the
characteristics of the Word of God in it.

 **G Guiding Word** (Psalm 119:105). 
:   It is a lamp unto our feet, to show how we should live; it is a
    light to our path, to reveal danger in the way; and it is a star
    that we shall find-as the wise men did-that leads to Christ. The
    Lord guides with His eye (Psalm 32:8); with His counsel (Psalm
    73:24); with His hands (Psalm 78:72); and with His Spirit (John
    16:13). And all this is by His Word. There is no guidance apart from
    the truth.
 **O Overcoming Word** (Psalm 119:98). 
:   We are wiser than our enemies, because we know their tactics through
    the Word. The way to overcome Satan is to meet him, as Christ did,
    with “It is written,” and the secret of victory over the world is by
    letting the Word dwell in us (1 John 2:14), and by simple faith in
    Christ.
 **D Delighting Word** (Psalm 119:92). 
:   The Word enables us to delight in the Lord, as the Psalmist did
    (Psalm 34:2); to delight in the work of Christ, as the Samaritans
    did under the preaching of Philip (Acts 8:8); it brings us joy, as
    the angels did to the shepherds (Luke 2:10); and it gives us
    gladness.
 **S Strengthening Word** (Psalm 119:112). 
:   The Word first inclines the heart, and then the heart is inclined to
    the Word. His Word puts strength of purpose in our hearts, so that
    we purpose to go in the strength of the Lord. He strengthens us by
    His Word for life’s journey, as the angel did Elijah with the food
    (1 Kings 19:7). He strengthens us for service, as Christ did the
    disciples with the promise of the enduement from on high (Luke
    24:49); and He empowers us for suffering, as He did Paul when He
    promised him sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9).\
    
 **W Winnowing Word** (Psalm 119:102). 
:   We are very foolish, and the Lord has often to teach us by painful
    experience how weak and erring we are; but His purpose in all His
    dealings is, that the chaff may be winnowed away, and that we may
    the better serve Him.
 **R Rejoicing Word** (Psalm 119:111). 
:   Jeremiah found rejoicing of heart, by eating the Word (Jer. 15:16),
    and the Ethiopian found joy in the Lord by believing in Christ (Acts
    8:39). Search the Scriptures to be sure, believe them to be bright,
    practise them to be powerful, and rest in them to rejoice.
 **I Instructing Word** (Psalm 119:95). 
:   Contemplation in the truth will enable us to confound our enemies.
    If we are instructed in the Word, and instructed by it, it will
    construct our character. Then we shall be like Abram’s instructed
    servants (Gen. 14:14, margin), able to overcome our enemies in
    conflict.
 **T Testing Word** (Psalm 119:96). 
:   We shall never be Pharisees boasting of our purity, if we go by the
    truth, and judge ourselves by the Word. The Word is a *light* to
    search out evil, a *hammer* to break down self, a *fire* to consume
    sin, and a *sword* to kill all that is not of God.
 **T Tried Word** (Psalm 119:105). 
:   Christ is the Tried Stone (Isa. 28:16). He is the Tried Stone in two
    senses. (1) Because He has been tried, and (2) because He tries. His
    Word is the same; it has come through the fire and stood the test;
    and as we try it, it tries us.
 **E Enduring Word** (Psalm 119:89). 
:   God’s Word is settled and more lasting than the heavens, for they
    shall pass away, but His truth remains. His Word is settled about
    sin and the sinner (Rom. 3:10); the Saviour and His Work (Heb.
    10:7); His servants and their message (Rom. 10:15); and about
    sanctification and the means of grace (Matt. 4:4).
 **N Nerving Word** (Psalm 119:107). 
:   Discouraged we are apt to be as Elijah was because of his enemies (1
    Kings 19:4); dismayed we may be as we think of the power of those we
    have to contend against, even as the companion of Elisha (2 Kings
    6:15); and disheartened as Israel was, because of the roughness of
    the way (Num. 21:4); but let us pray the Psalmist’s prayer; then we
    shall have spiritual nerve to endure whatever comes.\
    
 **W Wonderful Word** (Psalm 119:103). 
:   It is the sweetest and dearest of all. There is no other like it, as
    David said of Goliath’s sword (1 Sam. 21:9). It is sweeter than
    honey, more precious than gold, and lasting as God. It is wonderful
    because of its *Author*; because of its *contents*; and because of
    its construction.
 **O Omnipotent Word**. 
:   The spirit that runs like an electric current through the words of
    the Psalmist is, that if anything is to be accomplished, it must be
    by and according to the Word.
 **R Refreshing Word** (Psalm 119:103). 
:   When David’s servants found the Egyptian in the field, he was almost
    dead; but they gave him food and his spirit came again, and he was
    refreshed and able to do David service (1 Sam. 30:12). Even so with
    the Word, it refreshes us, and with renewed vigour we go on our way.
 **D Delivering Word** (Psalm 119:101). 
:   Goliath came against David in his own name, and was defeated. David
    went against Goliath in the name of the Lord, and according to His
    Word, and was delivered.

# 176. Grace

1.  THE grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **saving grace.** “By *grace*
    ye are saved” (Eph. 2:5).
2.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **sufficient grace.** “My
    *grace* is sufficient for thee” (2 Cor. 12:9).
3.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **stimulating grace.** “By
    the *grace* of God I am what I am” (1 Cor. 15:10).
4.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **serving grace.** “Let us
    have *grace* whereby we may serve God acceptably” (Heb. 12:28).
5.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **stablishing grace.** “It is
    a good thing that the heart be established with *grace*” (Hebrews
    13:9).
6.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **sacrificing grace.** “Ye
    know the *grace* of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich,
    yet for your sakes He became poor” (2 Cor. 8:9).
7.  The grace that is in Christ Jesus is a **supplying grace.** “Of His
    fulness have all we received, and *grace* for *grace*” (John 1:16).

\




# 177. Grace

1.  **Justified** by grace. “Justified freely by His *grace*” (Rom.
    3:24).
2.  **Standing** in grace. “This *grace* wherein we stand” (Rom. 5:2).
3.  **Saved** by grace. “By *grace* ye are saved” (Eph. 2:5).
4.  **Elected** by grace. “A remnant according to the election of
    *grace*” (Rom. 11:5).
5.  **Strengthened** by grace. “My *grace* is sufficient . . . . . . My
    strength is made perfect” (2 Cor. 12:9).
6.  **Working** by grace. “I laboured . . . . . . yet not I, but the
    *grace* of God” (1 Cor. 15:10).
7.  **Growing** in grace. “Grow in *grace*” (2 Peter 3:18).

\




# 178. Graciousness of Jesus

WE do not wonder at the gracious words that fell from Christ’s lips, for
grace was poured into them (Ps. 45:2), the grace of God was upon Him
(Luke 2:40); yea, He was full of grace and truth (John 1:14, 16). “His
mouth is most sweet” (Song of Solomon 5:16). His mouth is sweet for many
reasons.

1.  Sweet, because **life-giving** (John 6:63).
2.  Sweet, because **supplying** (Song of Solomon 1:2).
3.  Sweet, because **assuring** (Isaiah 58:14).
4.  Sweet, because **sustaining** (Deut. 8:3).
5.  Sweet, because **comforting** (John 14:1).
6.  Sweet, because **powerful** (Heb. 4:12).
7.  Sweet, because **searching** (Rev. 1:16).

The words of Christ are like oil upon the troubled waters, they bring
calmness and comfort; they are like bread to the hungry man, they bring
nourishment and nerve; they are like the warm spring, which causes
nature to bud and blossom; they are like an unfailing spring, ever fresh
and full; they are like a salve to a wound, healing and soothing; and
they are like honey for sweetness and satisfaction.

\




# 179. Groans

1.  GROAN of the **captive.** “And God heard their groaning” (Ex. 2:24;
    6:5; Acts 7:34).
2.  Groan of Christ on the **Cross.** “My groaning is not hid from Thee”
    (Ps. 38:9).
3.  Groan of the **sympathising Saviour.** “He groaned in the spirit”
    (John 11:33).
4.  Groan of the **believer.** “We do groan, being burdened” (2 Cor.
    5:2, 4; Rom. 8:23).
5.  Groan of the **Spirit.** “Maketh intercession for us with
    groanings,” &c. (Rom. 8:26).
6.  Groan of the **afflicted soul.** “I am weary with my groaning”
    (Psalms 6:6).
7.  Groan of **creation.** “The whole creation groaneth” (Romans 8:22).

\




# 180. Half-Heartedness

II. CHRONICLES 25:1-16

MORE mischief is wrought in the camp of God’s people from
half-heartedness than from anything else.

1.  **Half-heartedness is the weak spring in the life that will prevent
    our acting right firmly.** As the spring in the lock will not make
    the bolt act well if it is weak, so the half-heartedness of Amaziah
    caused him to act weakly in avenging the death of his his father
    (2Ch 25:4).
2.  **Half-heartedness is the earthly gas that causes the heart to be
    inflated with worldly ambition.** Doubtless Amaziah wanted to be big
    with his large army (2Ch 25:6). The balloon will ascend when filled
    with gas, but if any harm comes to it, the greater the damage when
    it falls; so those who rise through carnal ambition will have a
    greater fall when the evil day comes.
3.  **Half-heartedness is the link that gives the ungodly the
    opportunity to couple themselves with the Lord’s people.** Amaziah
    should not have been in association with Israel, as Israel was not
    in association with God (2Ch 25:7).
4.  **Half-heartedness is the flaw that hinders the inflow of Divine
    power into the life.** Hence there is hesitation instead of
    promptitude, as in the case of Amaziah, when he vacillated after he
    had got the direct word from God through the prophet (2Ch 25:9).
5.  **Half-heartedness is like a jaded horse which needs a great deal of
    spur and whip to make it go.** Amaziah did not act as before God; he
    needed the spur of the prophet’s words to urge him to obedience (2Ch
    25:7-10).
6.  **Half-heartedness is like the sparrow which is caught in the trap
    in trying to get the crumbs.** Amaziah was caught by the idolatry of
    the people whom he had conquered (2Ch 25:14).
7.  **Half-heartedness is the conductor that brings the lightning of
    God’s punishment upon itself** (2Ch 25:15-16). The rod of God’s
    chastisement (Heb. 12:5-11), and bodily death (1 Cor. 11:30), are
    two ways by which God punishes His children.

# 181. “Hallelujah! What a Saviour”

**Almighty** Saviour to liberate us (Psalm 106:21).
**Bruised** Saviour to redeem us (Acts 5:30, 31).
**Comely** Saviour to adorn us (2 Peter 1:1).
**Divine** Saviour to bless us (Titus 3:4).
**Eternal** Saviour to secure us (Jude 25).
**Faithful** Saviour to keep us (Phil. 3:20).
**Great** Saviour to deliver us (Isaiah 19:20).
**Holy** Saviour to sanctify us (Isaiah 43:3).
**Indwelling** Saviour to rule us (Isaiah 43:11).
**Joyous** Saviour to gladden us (Zeph. 3:17).
**Kind** Saviour to crown us (Titus 3:6).

7.  **Represented** by a heavenly High Priest (Heb. 9:24).

# 186. Help of the Lord

II. CHRON. 19:9

IF we can say “The Lord is my Helper,” we can also declare, “I will not
fear” (Heb. 13:6).

1.  In **perplexity,** He is our Help to direct, as He did Eliezer
    (Genesis 24:12, 42).

# 187. Hidden

"HID" (HEBREWS 11:23).

1.  **Under the blood** we are hidden in safety from the judgment of
    God’s wrath against sin, as Israel was in Egypt (Ex. 12:13).
2.  **In the Lord’s hand** we are hidden from all danger (John

6.  **In His Word** we hide for victory and assurance (Ps. 119:114).
7.  **In His quiver** we hide to be used (Isaiah 49:2).

The hiding of Moses was an act of faith, as we are told in Heb. 11:23.
The parents of Moses had confidence in God, and therefore hid their
child in opposition to the king’s commandment. If we would have the
hiding that the Lord is able to give, we must put implicit confidence in
Him at all times.
# 188. “Him”

1.  **Standing.** “*In* Him” (Ephesians 1:4).
2.  **Trust.** “*Upon* Him” (1 Peter 5:7).
3.  **Communion.** “*With* Him” (John 1:39).

3.  **Security** of His presence. “Thou shalt hide them in the secret of
    Thy *presence*” (Psalm 31:20).
4.  **Joy** of His presence. “In Thy *presence* is fulness of joy”
    (Psalm 16:11).
5.  **Refreshing** of His presence. “Times of refreshing shall come from
    the *presence* of the Lord” (Acts 3:19).
6.  **Searching** of His presence. “The upright shall dwell in Thy
    *presence*” (Psalm 140:13).
7.  **Good cheer** of His presence. “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not
    afraid” (Matthew 14:27).

# 192. Holiness

REASONS WHY THE BELIEVER SHOULD BE HOLY.

1.  BECAUSE of what **God is.** “I am holy.” Thomas Watson says, God is
    holy intrinsically. He is holy in His nature; His very being is made
    up of holiness, as light is the essence of the sun. He is holy in
    His Word. The Word bears a stamp of His holiness upon it, as the wax
    bears an impression of the seal. “Thy Word is very pure” (Psalm
    119:140). It is compared to silver refined seven times (Psalm 12:6).
    Every line in the Word breathes sanctity; it encourages nothing but
    holiness. God is holy in all His operations. All He does is holy; He
    cannot act but like Himself; He can no more do an unrighteous action
    than the sun can darken. “The Lord is Holy in all His works” (Psalm
    145:17).
2.  Because of what **He has done** (Lev. 11:45). Because God brought
    Israel out of Egypt, and delivered them from Pharaoh, He had a claim
    upon their gratitude and obedience; even so has He upon us. We love,
    because He first loved us; we serve, because He has served us; we
    trust, because He has been true to us; we obey, because of His Word
    to us; and we walk in His ways because of what He has done for us.
3.  Because **He commands it** (Lev. 19:2). We are to be holy because
    the Lord tells us to be. He commands, and we must obey; for
    obedience is the life of holiness. It is not for us to compromise,
    or question as King Saul did in relation to Agag (1 Samuel
    15:20-21), for to obey is better than sacrifice.
4.  Because of **His relationship to us.** “Sanctify yourselves,
    therefore, and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God” (Lev. 20:7).
    Newberry, in the margin of his Bible, renders the title, “Lord,”
    “Jehovah-Mekaddeshcem.” Wherever we get the title Jehovah, it brings
    before us God in covenant relationship. There are ten different
    aspects in which God reveals Himself as Jehovah. He is
    Jehovah-Jireh, to provide for us; Jehovah-Ropheca, to heal us;
    Jehovah-Nissi, to enable us to conquer; Jehovah-Shalom, to calm us;
    Jehovah-Tsebahoth, to lead us; Jehovah-Rohi, to care for us;
    Jehovah-Heleyon, to lift us up; Jehovah Tsidkenu, to cover us;
    Jehovah-Shammah, who is with us; and Jehovah-Mekaddeshcem, to
    sanctify us.
5.  Because of **His choice of us.** “And ye shall be holy unto Me, for
    I, the Lord, am holy, and have severed you from other people, that
    ye should be Mine” (Lev. 20:26). Why has He chosen us? To save us
    from hell? Yes, but more than that; we are chosen in Christ that we
    should be holy, and without blame before Him in love. Talk not of
    election, if there is not the evidence of it in holiness of life.
    For, if we are like the Ephraimite, who said that he was not an
    Ephraimite, but when put to the test by the Gileadite, who told him
    to say “Shibboleth,” betrayed that he was what he said he was not;
    in like manner our life will soon speak out what we are (Judges
    12:6).
6.  Because of **our relationship to Him.** “They shall”-the priests-”be
    holy unto their God” (Lev. 21:6). Aaron and his sons were to be holy
    because they were priests. We are royal priests to shew forth the
    praises of Him, who has called us out of darkness into His
    marvellous light for that express purpose. How careful in demeanour,
    how courteous in manner, and constant in attendance the Queen’s
    servants are. And why? Because they are the Queen’s servants. We are
    servants of the King of kings, and that is the reason we are to be
    holy.
7.  Because **He promises to do it.** “He shall be holy unto thee, for
    I, the Lord, which sanctify you, am holy” (Lev. 21:8). We may be
    sure of this, that when God tells us to be, to do, and to suffer, He
    will meet our need, even as in the case of Paul, who prayed thrice
    that the thorn might be removed, but the Lord answered by saying,
    “My grace is sufficient for thee.”

# 193. Holy Spirit and Christ

IF there is one thing more than another that is stated of the Lord
Jesus, it is, that in His life and labours, as the Man and Servant of
God, He was dependent upon the Holy Spirit. There are no less than
*fifteen* direct references to the Holy Spirit and His action in
relation to the Lord Jesus, and *vice versa*.

1.  Christ was **born** of the Holy Spirit as to His human nature
    (Matthew 1:18).
2.  The Holy Spirit was the Father’s promised **gift** to Christ
    (Matthew 12:18).
3.  Christ was **sealed** with the Holy Spirit at His baptism (Mark
    1:10).
4.  The normal condition of Christ as to His life was, that He was
    **full** of the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:1).
5.  The Holy Spirit was the **sphere** in which Christ moved (Luke
    4:14).
6.  Christ was **led** by the Holy Spirit (Matt. 4:1).
7.  The Holy Spirit was the **power** by which Christ exercised His
    ministry (Luke 4:18).
8.  The Holy Spirit was the **energy** in which Christ overcame the
    powers of Satan (Matt. 12:28).
9.  The Holy Spirit was the **secret** of Christ’s joy (Luke 10:21).
10. The Holy Spirit was the **anointing** which enabled Christ to go
    about doing good (Acts 10:38).
11. The Holy Spirit was the **strength** which enabled Christ to offer
    Himself as a sacrifice to God on account of sin (Heb. 9:14).
12. The Holy Spirit was the **might** by which Christ was raised from
    the dead (Romans 8:11).
13. The Lord Jesus was the **Bestower** of the Holy Spirit to His
    disciples (John 20:22).
14. The Holy Spirit was the **authority** by which Christ gave His
    commands (Acts 1:2).
15. The Holy Spirit was the **justifier** of Christ (1 Tim. 3:16).

\




# 194. Honey

1.  **The manna** that fell in the wilderness tasted like honey. “The
    taste of it was like wafers made with *honey*” (Exodus 16:31).
2.  **The land of Canaan**, which is typical of earthly blessing to the
    full, is said to be a land flowing with milk and honey. “I am
    come…to bring…unto a land flowing with milk and *honey*” (Exodus
    3:8).
3.  **The abundance of God’s favour and grace** is likened to honey. “He
    made him to suck *honey* out of the rock” (Deut. 32:13).
4.  **The preciousness and sweetness of God’s Word** are- “Sweeter also
    than *honey* and the honeycomb” (Psalm 19:10).
5.  **Pleasant words** and sweetness of expression are compared to
    honey. “Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul”
    (Proverbs 16:24).
6.  **Christ’s delight** in His people when they are bringing forth
    fruit is as a feast to Him. “I have eaten My honeycomb with My
    *honey*” (Solomon’s Song 5:1).
7.  **Pleasures of sin** and the lusts of the flesh are likened to
    honey. “For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb”
    (Proverbs 5:3).

# 195. House of the Lord

1.  **House of Contemplation.** “One thing have I desired of the Lord,
    that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the *house of the Lord*
    all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
    enquire in His temple” (Psalm 27:4).
2.  **House of Satisfaction.** “They shall be abundantly satisfied with
    the fatness of Thy *house*; and Thou shalt make them drink of the
    river of Thy pleasures” (Psalm 36:8).
3.  **House of Praise.** “Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Name of the
    Lord; praise Him, O ye servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the
    *house of the Lord*, in the courts of the *house* of our God” (Psalm
    135:1-2).
4.  **House of Fellowship.** “We took sweet counsel together and walked
    unto the *house* of God in company” (Psalm 55:14).
5.  **House of Offerings.** “I will go into Thy *house* with burnt
    offerings. I will pay Thee my vows” (Psalm 66:13).
6.  **House of Growth.** “Those that be planted in the *house of the
    Lord* shall flourish in the courts of our God” (Psalm 92:13).
7.  **House of Holiness.** “Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness
    becometh Thine *house*, O Lord, for ever” (Psalm 93:5).
8.  **House of Testimony.** “I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the
    presence of all His people. In the courts of the Lord’s *house*, in
    the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord” (Psalm
    116:18-19).
9.  **House of Blessing.** “Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the
    Lord: we have blessed you out of the *house of the Lord*” (Psalm
    118:26).
10. **House of Constraint.** “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us
    go into the *house of the Lord*. Because of the *house of the Lord*
    our God I will seek thy good” (Psalm 122:1, 9).

“Blessed is the man whom Thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
Thee, that he may dwell in Thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the
goodness of Thy *house*, even Thy holy temple” (Ps. 65:4).
# 196. How to Serve

“SERVE Him in sincerity and truth” (Joshua 24:14). Sincerity and truth
are the weights that keep the soul in balance.

Sincerity is the ring of the coin which tells out its genuineness; the
straight line of rectitude, and the test of fidelity.

The term rendered “*sincerity*” is translated “*perfect*” in Gen. 17:1;
“*without blemish*” in Lev. 1:3; “*full*” in Lev. 25:30; “*upright*” in
Psalm 37:18; “*undefiled*” in Psalm 119:1; “*sound*” in Psalm 119:80;
and “*whole*” in Proverbs 1:12. We should serve the Lord with-

**Sincerity** of purpose (Col. 3:24).

**Perfectness** of walk (1 Thess. 1:9).

**Unblemishedness** of life (Acts 26:7).

**Thoroughness** (Romans 12:1).

**Uprightness** of heart (Romans 12:2).

**Undefiled** conduct (Luke 1:74).

**Soundness** of motive (Romans 7:6).

**Wholeness** of being (Hebrews 12:28).

\




# 197. "I Am"

WHEN Moses wishes to know the name of the person who has sent him, that
he may tell the children of Israel, he is told to say, “I Am hath sent
me unto you” (Ex. 3:14). When we have the “I Am” as our Commissioner, we
have all He *is*, all He *has*, and all He can *do* at our back. It
seems as if the Lord said, “Whatever you need, I, the great I Am, will
supply it.” The Jesus of the New Testament is the Jehovah of the Old
Testament. Therefore the “I Am’s” of the Gospel of John will illustrate
this point. No less than eight times does Christ use the very words we
have in relation to Himself.

**Christ’s word to the woman of Samaria.** “*I* that speak unto thee
*Am*” (John 4:26). (The *He* is in italics in Revised Version, and
should be left out).

**Christ’s word to the Jews.** “Except ye believe that *I Am* (margin)
ye shall die in your sins” (John 8:24, R.V.) “Ye shall know that *I Am*”
(John 8:28, R.V., M.) “Before Abraham was *I Am*” (John 8:58).

**Christ’s word to the disciples respecting His betrayal.** “I tell you
before it come to pass, that ye may believe that *I Am*” (John 13:19,
R.V., M.)

**Christ’s word to Judas and the soldiers in response to their admission
that they were seeking Him.** “Jesus saith unto them, *I Am*.” No wonder
they went back and tell to the ground when He said, “*I Am*.” Again,
Christ asks them as to the One they are seeking, and in reply, “Jesus
answered, I told you I Am” (John 18:5-6, 8, R.V.) Leave out the “He” in
each of the above verses. As in the former case, it is given in italics
in R.V., and should be omitted. Thus the Great I Am is discovered in the
lowly Jesus. What force and fulness this gives to Christ’s titles!

Are we hungry? He says, “I Am the Bread of Life” (John 6:35, 41, 48,
51).

Are we dark? He says, “I Am the Light of the world” (John 8:12).

Do we need an open way to God? He says, “I Am the Way” (John 14:6).

Do we want an entrance into blessing? He says, “I Am the Door” (John
10:7, 9).

Do we need a substitute? He says, “I Am the Good Shepherd, who giveth
His life for the sheep” (John 10:11, 14).

Do we need life? Christ says, “I Am the Life” (John 14:6).

Do we need truth? Christ says, “I am the Truth” (John 14:6).

Do we need fruitfulness? He says, “I Am the True Vine” (John 15:1, 5).

Is it a question of raising our loved ones? He says, “I Am the
Resurrection” (John 11:25).
# 198. Ignorance

THE natural man is ignorant of the-

1.  **Word of Christ.** “But they understood not that saying” (Mark
    9:32).
2.  **Person of Christ.** “They knew Him not” (Acts 13:27; 17:23).
3.  **Righteousness of God.** “Have not submitted themselves unto the
    righteousness of God” (Rom. 10:3).
4.  **Goodness of God.** “Despisest thou the riches of His goodness”
    (Rom. 2:4).
5.  **Of the believer.** “As unknown” (2 Cor. 6:9).

THINGS God would not have the believer ignorant of-

1.  **Our standing.** “Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized
    into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death” (Rom. 6:3).
2.  **His purpose towards Israel.** “Not.….ignorant of this mystery”
    (Rom. 11:25).
3.  **The Old Testament.** “Not.….ignorant how that all our fathers” (1
    Cor. 10:1).
4.  **Gifts.** “Spiritual gifts.…..….I would not have you ignorant” (1
    Cor. 12:1).
5.  **The Lord’s coming.** “Ignorant.….concerning them which are asleep”
    (1 Thess. 4:13).

Christ has compassion on the ignorant. “Who can have compassion on the
ignorant” (Heb. 5:2).

Believer not ignorant of Satan’s devices. “Not ignorant of his devices”
(2 Cor. 2:11).
# 199. "I Know's" of Paul

1.  “**I know** that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
    thing” (Rom. 7:18).
2.  “**I know** nothing by (against) myself” (1 Cor. 4:4).
3.  “**I know** in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known”
    (1 Cor. 13:12).
4.  “**I know**” of all things working for good (Phil. 1:19).
5.  “**I know** that I shall continue with you all” (Phil. 1:25).
6.  “**I know** how to be abased, and I know how to abound” (Phil.
    4:12).
7.  “**I know** whom I have believed” (2 Tim. 1:12).

# 200. Inclusiveness of "In Christ"

“1 Christ” is an inclusive term, for it tells us that the believer is
blessed with all spiritual blessings in Him.

1.  1 Christ we are **absolved** from all charges. “In (*en*, the
    preposition that is usually rendered *in*) Him all that believe are
    justified from all things” (Acts 13:39).
2.  1 Christ we have **bequeathed** to us untold bounty. “Freely
    bestowed on us in the Beloved” (Eph. 1:6, R.V.)
3.  1 Christ we are **chosen** in the holiness of His person. “Chosen us
    in Him . . . . that we should be holy” (Eph. 1:4).
4.  1 Christ we are **delivered** from all condemnation. “No
    condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 8:1).
5.  1 Christ we have an **endowment** that is sufficient for all our
    need. “God shall fulfil every need of yours according to His riches

# 203. Indwelling

*What is the result or evidence of God dwelling in us, and we dwelling
in God?* We can but give a few of the Scriptures, reminding our readers

# 209. Inquiring—Directed

*To inquire of the Lord is to be directed by Him* (2 Sam. 2:1). The

3.  **Walking** with the Lord (Mal. 2:6).

prayer and obedience. Self acts upon its own authority, and is
discomfited, as was Balaam (Numbers 22:22-35), but faith goes at God’s
bidding, and is delivered (Exodus 14:15).

    hand” (John 10:28-29).

# 213. “In the Midst”

JESUS was the Centre of Attraction, as well as occupying a central
position. It is of interest to mark how often we read of Christ being
“*in the midst*.”

“In the midst”-

1.  As the **Centre of Attraction** (Matt. 18:20).

# 215. Israel's Bondage in Egypt

EXODUS 1:1-14

SIN is presented to us in various ways in the Word of God. Sin is a
consuming disease which has destroyed the organs of man’s spiritual
sense. Sin is a huge barrier rising up like an impassable mountain,
which keeps God from man and man from God. Sin is represented as a heavy
burden, which oppresses the sinner with an awful weight when the
conscience is awakened. Sin is as a lurking monster, which waits to
pounce upon its unwary victim. Sin is a despotic master, who rules his
subjects with an iron hand and a relentless will. Sin is stated to be
such a master in Romans 6, and is illustrated in the Pharaoh who knew
not Joseph.

1.  **The cunningness of sin** (Ex. 1:10). “Let us deal *wisely* with
    them,” was the conclusion the Egyptians came to, with regard to the
    Israelites; or, as the margin of Psalm 58:5 renders the term,
    “*cunning*,” where the word occurs in relation to the charmer
    seeking to charm the serpent. Sin’s policy is to present itself in
    as attractive a form as possible, and to hide its real purpose,
    which is to get its victim entirely in its folds, and then to crush
    to death, as the serpent, which first fascinates its prey and then
    folds it in the grip of death.
2.  **The reign of sin.** Pharaoh set taskmasters over the children of
    Israel (Ex. 1:11). The word here rendered “taskmaster” is one that
    is generally used for a “prince” or “ruler” (Ex. 2:14; 18:21). But
    these rulers soon developed into oppressors, for when they are
    spoken of again (Ex. 3:7; 5:6, 10, 13, 14) a stronger term is used,
    which means an “oppressor” (Job 3:18). The same expression is used
    of the Anti-christ (Isaiah 9:4; 14:4), when speaking of him as the
    “Exactor” (Dan. 11:20, M.). Sin is a hard taskmaster, and those who
    are under its rule find it to be a greater despot than even the King
    of Babylon, who when his command was disobeyed, caused the three
    Hebrew young men to be cast into the fiery furnace.
3.  **The affliction of sin** (Ex. 1:11). The meaning of the word
    “afflict” is to humble. The word is so rendered in Deut. 8:2, 16.
    What an affliction it was to the Israelites to come from being
    specially honoured by the king and his prime minister, to be humbled
    to the position of serfs, and to the lash of the taskmasters. Sin’s
    patronage may end in persecution. As the ruin of a stately castle
    will remind us of a glory passed away, so many an one who bears the
    humbling marks of iniquity, still carries with him a bearing which
    speaks of a position lost by sin. Anyone who has been in our common
    lodging houses will find many examples. Broken down clergymen,
    lawyers, and merchants are to be found in these places, like
    stranded vessels which are shipwrecked on the rocks, being broken to
    pieces by the waves as they dash against them.
4.  **The burden of sin** (Ex. 1:11). The way they afflicted Israel was
    with burdens. There is a pleasure in sin, but there is also pain.
    Many a boy who has had pleasure in playing truant from school has
    found that it has led to the cane upon his back, or twenty-four
    hours extra in bed, much to his chafing. One cannot help being
    impressed with the fact that many a man will put himself to great
    trouble in seeking to achieve his sinful purpose. The sinner
    convicted by the Holy Spirit specially finds that sin is a terrible
    burden, as Bunyan pictures in his *Pilgrim’s Progress*, when he
    depicts Christian with a heavy burden upon his back; and as the
    Psalmist confesses when he exclaims, “Mine iniquities are gone over
    mine head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me” (Ps. 38:4).
5.  **The bitterness of sin** (Ex. 1:14). Sorrow is the child of sin and
    the bitter fruit of iniquity. At the bottom of every cup of iniquity
    there is a snake that bites the quaffer and leaves its poison in the
    veins to torment its victim. The young fellow who has weakened his
    body by his sinful ways, and is filled with remorse at the prospect
    of an untimely death, knows the bitterness of sin. The drunkard with
    his aching head, parched throat, and unsatisfied thirst, knows the
    sorrow of his evil way; and the one who is put into prison because
    of his dishonest action, feels the misery of his evil ways as he is
    kept in durance vile and hard labour.
6.  **The rigour of sin** (Ex. 1:13-14). The Egyptians were really cruel
    to the Israelites, for so the term means as it is given in Ez. 34:4.
    By the sighs and cries which escaped the Israelites (Ex. 2:23-24)
    this is evidenced. They were pressed and oppressed beyond measure,
    and groaned beneath their hard lot. Sin is more cruel than the
    taskmasters of Egypt. It sears the conscience (1 Tim. 4:2), blinds
    the eyes of the understanding (Mark 8:18), dulls the moral sense
    (Eph. 4:19), kills kindly feeling (1 John 2:9), deafens the ears of
    the soul (Mark 8:18), binds the spirit with cords of iniquity (John
    8:34), and separates from God (Isa. 59:2).

Jehovah graciously raised up a deliverer for Israel. In like manner the
Lord has graciously sent a Saviour (John 3:16-18) for us. To receive Him
is to be saved by Him, and thus to be redeemed from the rigour of sin.

7.  The “I will” of **degradation.** “His enemies *will I* clothe with
    shame (Psalm 132:18).

# 218. “I Wills” of Grace

GOD’S action in grace is seen in the Gospel. Under the law it was “Thou
shalt,” but under grace it is “I will.” The following seven “I wills” of
the New Testament illustrate the action of grace:—

1.  The “I will” of **forgiveness** (Heb. 10:17).

    14:30).

# 220. Jacob

GENESIS 25:27

IN thinking of Jacob as a supplanter, we have not given him credit for
many good things about him.

1.  **The plain man.** “Jacob was a plain man.” The margin of the
    Revised Version gives it that he was “quiet, or harmless, Heb.
    perfect.” The Hebrew word is generally rendered elsewhere “perfect.”
    It is thus given in speaking of the “perfect man” in Psalm 37:37;
    64:4. It is not always the most skilful or cunning that have the
    most character about them. Very often the quiet, studious boy who
    plods away at his lessons, and is called a “muff,” has the most
    character in him. A big drum makes plenty of noise when it is
    beaten, but it is empty for all that. So with many who make a loud
    noise as to acquirements. The fishermen that Christ chose to be His
    disciples were obscure and unlearned men, but filled with the Spirit
    of God, they were the men that God used to “turn the world upside
    down.”
2.  **The separate pilgrim.** “Dwelling in tents.” The dwelling in tents
    was always the sign of a separated life (Heb. 11:9). The patriarchs
    confessed that they had no city here, but that they looked for one.
    We show we are pilgrims and strangers on the earth, as we live a
    life separate from evil and walk in fellowship with God (1 Peter
    2:11-12).
3.  **The wily Jacob.** We certainly cannot justify the means by which
    Jacob obtained the birthright. To say the least, it was unkind and
    mean for Jacob to take advantage of his brother’s hunger, even
    though he knew the Lord had said, “The elder shall serve the
    younger.” Jacob’s scheming is the blot upon his life, the spot in
    the sun of his character, and he had to reap what he sowed. He
    deceived Isaac, and Laban deceived him. It never pays to seek to
    hurry the hand of God. Men say, “the end justifies the means.” That
    is a principle God never recognises. The end was the same when Moses
    disobeyed God in smiting the rock, but God did not justify the
    means, for he shut Moses out of the land for his disobedience.

# 221. Jacob's Blessing

GENESIS 32:25-30

1.  **Jacob received no blessing as long as he was struggling** (Gen.
    32:25). Jacob was resisting the man who came to him, instead of
    submitting. Trusting in the Lord is the condition to be in to
    receive blessing, not striving against Him.
2.  **Jacob’s humiliation is the beginning of blessing** (Gen. 32:25).
    The angel touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh. His strength was
    gone, as his thigh is out of joint. The thigh out of joint humbled
    Jacob, and led him to see his weakness, and that brought him in
    joint with God.
3.  **Jacob’s clinging is the secret of his blessing** (Gen. 32:26).
    Jacob will not let the angel go till he blesses him; but mark, it is
    while he clings he is blessed, and not while he is striving. The
    resistance of unbelief and self-will will never receive blessing,
    but the tenacity of faith always does.
4.  **Jacob’s changed name an evidence of blessing** (Gen. 32:28). From
    Jacob, a supplanter, he is called “Israel,” *i.e.*, a prince with
    God. In like manner they who believe in Christ have their name
    changed from children of wrath (Eph. 2:3) to children of God (John
    1:12); from sinners to saints.

# 222. Jacob's Isolation

**Jacob’s isolation with God** (Gen. 32:24). The very best thing for
Jacob was to be alone with God. One has well said in speaking of this
aloneness with God, “Jacob was left alone purposely for secret prayer,
so the Church gets into ‘the clefts of the rocks’ (Cant. 2:14); Isaac
into the fields; Daniel to the river’s side; Christ into the mount;
Peter up to the house-top; that they may pour out their prayers and
solace themselves with God in secret.”

1.  Alone with God we are stripped of self-righteousness, as in the case
    of Job (Job 42:6).
2.  Alone with God we get to know our inward corruption and
    uncomeliness, as in the case of Daniel (Daniel 10:8).
3.  Alone with Christ, He instructs in Divine things as He did His
    disciples (Mark 4:34).
4.  Alone with God we are led into greater blessing, as in the case of
    Jacob (Gen 32:28-29).

# 223. Jacob's Journey

GENESIS xxviii

JACOB on his way to Padan-aram, and his being met and encouraged by God,
is one of the brightest features in his life.

1.  **The Obedient Son.** “Jacob went out from Beersheba,” &c. (Gen.
    28:10). Jacob was not merely fleeing from Esau’s ire in leaving
    home, but he was obeying his father (Gen. 28:7), in going to seek
    for a wife among his uncle’s people. “Beersheba” means “the well of
    the oath” (Gen. 21:31); and “Haran” signifies “parched, dry.” It
    will often be found that the path of obedience will lead us from
    some well of prosperity to a parched place of adversity and trial.
    But better be there with the Lord than in some pleasant way without
    Him.
    -   “Out of my stony griefs
    -   Bethel I’ll raise.”

2.  **The Weary Man** (Gen. 28:11). Tired with his journey, he seeks a
    resting-place amid his not very inviting surroundings, for, as
    Stanley says in speaking of the place, “The track of the pilgrims
    winds through an uneven valley, covered, as with grave-stones, by
    large sheets of bare rock, some few here and there standing up like
    the cromlechs of Druidical monuments.” Lonely, tired, home-sick,
    with the sky for his ceiling, and a stone for a pillow, he falls
    asleep, and finds that God gives to His beloved in sleep (Ps. 127:2,
    R.V., M).
3.  **The Privileged Dreamer** (Gen. 28:12). Jacob sees in vision the
    way cast up from earth to heaven, thus connecting heaven and earth,
    and opening up communication between Jacob and God.
4.  **The Enriched Descendant** (Gen. 28:13). God reveals Himself as the
    “God of Abraham and Isaac,” and repeats the promise to Jacob He gave
    to them, that he and his seed shall possess the land. Thus Jacob
    finds the blessedness of a godly ancestry. Grace does not run in the
    blood, but notwithstanding there are advantages in having godly
    parents.
5.  **The Blessed Seed** (Gen. 28:14). Here again is a repeated promise.
    (See Gen. 12:2-3; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4). After the flesh Israel has
    been a blessing to all nations (Rom. 9:4-5), and they are yet to be
    a greater blessing (Rom. 11:12; Isaiah 60)
6.  **The Sustained Pilgrim** (Gen. 28:15). The presence of the Lord is
    to be the sustaining power of Jacob in all his wanderings. Mark what
    that meant to him, and what it also means to the believer in Christ.
7.  **The Astonished Sleeper** (Gen. 28:16). Jacob little expected that
    the Lord would meet him where He did, but the unexpected often
    happens. When we little expect to find the Lord He finds us. Jacob
    is astonished as he recalls his dream, and is reminded that God has
    been speaking to him. Many who are spiritually asleep would do well
    to wake up to the fact that the Lord has spoken to them, and is
    still speaking (Eph. 5:14; Rom. 13:11-14).
8.  **The Fearful Confessor** (Gen. 28:17). Jacob was not the only one
    who has been afraid in the conscious presence of God. Moses (Hebrews
    12:21), Job (Job 42:5-6), Isaiah (Isaiah 6:5), Peter (Luke 5:8), and
    John (Rev. 1:17-18), were the same. A holy awe and a filial fear
    should ever characterise those who know the Lord (Phil. 2:12).
9.  **The Early Riser** (Gen. 28:18). Jacob was no laggard or lie-a-bed.
    He was up betimes. Sleepy heads never make wise heads, and sleepy
    hearts are never warm hearts. The early birds get the worms. The
    manna must be gathered in the morning, if there is to be the
    gathered manna.
10. **The Consecrating Remembrancer** (Gen. 28:18-19). Jacob changes the
    name of the place from Luz to Bethel by anointing the pillar he had
    used as a pillow. “Luz” means “departure” or “perverseness;” and
    “Bethel” signifies the “house of God.” Many a Luz has been made into
    a Bethel by the consecrating oil of God’s grace, through faith in
    Him who died for sinners. On the 10th of May, 1869, at a place
    called Promontory Point, the junction was made completing the
    railway communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, in
    the United States of America. A silver spike was brought by the
    Governor of Arizona, another was contributed by the citizens of
    Nevada. They were driven home into a sleeper of Californian laurel
    with a silver mallet. As the last blow was struck the hammer was
    brought into contact with a telegraph wire, and the news was flashed
    and simultaneously saluted on the shores of two great oceans, and
    through the expanse of a vast continent, by the roar of cannon and
    the chiming of bells. When the awful abyss between God and man had
    to be bridged, the junction over the deepest chasm was made by the
    outstretched arms of the Son of God, and as the spikes crushed
    through His opened palms, He cried, “It is finished,” and swifter
    than electric current or lightning’s flash the tidings were winged
    to the farthest bounds of three worlds. The stairway connecting
    earth with heaven is completed; the awful chasm is bridged. Luz is
    transformed into Bethel; Christ by dying has opened up the way to
    God.

# 224. Jacob's Prayer

GENESIS xxxii

THERE are six things we note about Jacob’s prayer.

1.  **Jacob’s fear of his brother’s anger was the prompter of his
    prayer** (Gen 32:11). The cause of Jacob’s fear of his brother was
    his mean conduct towards him; hence he is seen cringing before Esau
    like a guilty culprit supplicating for mercy; and acting like a
    coward in that he sends one company in front of the other, and sends
    a present to appease his brother’s anger. Note that any punishment
    we unrighteously inflict upon others is sure to come back upon our
    own heads. But for all that the Lord listened to Jacob’s cry. What a
    God of grace with whom we have to do!
2.  **Jacob’s relationship to God is his plea in prayer** (Gen 32:9). He
    pleads his relationship to God in the words, “O God of my father,”
    &c. If we know God as our Father, the right way in speaking to Him
    is to call Him “Father” (see John 1:12-13; Gal. 4:6). But if we have
    not answered God’s prayer (2 Cor. 5:20), how can we expect Him to
    answer ours? A father will often grant the request of his child
    while he refuses the plea of a stranger.
3.  **God’s promise is Jacob’s argument in prayer** (Gen 32:9-12). Jacob
    pleads two “I wills” of God. When we can pin our prayers to God’s
    promise, we are sure He will perform His word. Mr. Spurgeon says,
    “Prayer should be pillared on promises, and pinnacled with praises.”
4.  **Jacob’s prayer is mingled with confession** (Gen 32:10). All God’s
    servants have ever confessed their unworthiness.
5.  **Jacob’s prayer is perfumed with praise** (Gen 32:10). Jacob
    acknowledges the mercy he had received from God, and gives praise to
    God. A thank*ful* man is full of blessing, while a thank*less* man
    is full of complaint. If we bless God with our praises, He will
    bless us with His mercies.
6.  **Jacob’s prayer is definite, personal, and answered** (Gen 32:11).
    “Deliver me,” Jacob cries, and the sequel shows how graciously God
    granted his prayer. His prayer was short and to the point, and it
    brought a speedy answer.

# 225. Jehoshaphat's Prayer

II. CHRONICLES 20:1-13

IN the previous chapter we read of Jehoshaphat charging Judah to take
heed and obey the Lord (2Ch 20:6-7), and to walk before Him with a
perfect heart (2Ch 20:9). At this time Judah seems to be in a fairly
prosperous state, the surrounding nations are jealous of it, and join
together to overthrow it. We find that the twentieth chapter opens with
these words, “After this.” Often we find that after great blessing comes
trial. It was so in the case of Abraham. God gave him the promised seed,
and then called upon him to offer up his son Isaac. After Israel had
been brought out of Egypt, then they are confronted by the Red Sea. It
was after Christ had been baptized, and acknowledged from heaven with
the Spirit’s anointing and the Father’s voice, that He was led away into
the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. “Every branch that beareth
fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit.” It is the
fruitful branch that has the pruning.

1.  **Preparation.** “Set himself to seek the Lord” (2Ch 20:3). If we
    would have power with God, we must have purity of heart. An
    uncondemning heart will surely bring abundant blessing. We do not
    expect the plant to grow while it is out of the ground, neither can
    we look for answers to our prayers unless we are in the conditions
    laid down in the Word.
2.  **Proclamation.** “Proclaimed a fast” (2Ch 20:3). It is interesting
    to note a few of the fasts mentioned in the Word, and the reasons
    for them.\
     Direction (Ezra 8:21), Idolatry (Jer. 36:9), Confession (Dan. 9:3),
    Humiliation (Jonah 3:5), To ask help (2Ch 20:3).
3.  **Consolidation.** “Gathered themselves together” (2Ch 20:4). Union
    in prayer means union of power. Get plenty of sticks and the fire
    will burn brightly.
4.  **Solicitation.** “Ask help of the Lord” (2Ch 20:4). Jehoshaphat
    stands like a beggar knocking at the door, and will not go away
    until he is answered. The Lord encourages us to importunity in the
    parables of the importunate widow (Luke 18:1, &c.), and the
    importunate friend (Luke 11:5, &c.). In Luke 11:9 we have an
    acrostic on the word “Ask.”
    **A** “Ask, and it shall be given you.”
    **S** “Seek, and ye shall find.”
    **K** “Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”
5.  **Supplication** (2Ch 20:6-13). Characteristics of Jehoshaphat’s
    prayer.
    *His prayer was reverent* (2Ch 20:6). He recognised God’s power and
    pleasure, might, majesty, and holiness.
    *In his prayer he reminds God of what He has done in the past* (2Ch
    20:7). Past mercies lead us to hope for present ones. He who has
    blessed, will bless; He who has fed, will feed; He who has led, will
    lead.
    *He reminds God of the relationship He holds to him*. “Our God.”
    “God of our fathers” (2Ch 20:6-7). A woman may forget her child, and
    a father neglect his offspring, but not so the Lord. He will
    remember to help us.
    *He pleads the promise of God* (2Ch 20:9). See 2Ch 6:28-30. If we
    bring the cheque of God’s promise, signed with the name of Jesus, He
    will surely keep to His word.
    *His prayer was pointed* (2Ch 20:10). He did not ramble, but he knew
    what he wanted, and waited for what he asked.
    *His prayer was humble* (2Ch 20:12). “We have no might.” When we are
    weak, then are we strong, and when we are strong, then we are weak.
    Asa relied on himself and his physicians, and was distressed (2Ch
    16:7, 12). Paul trusted in the Lord, and was strengthened (2 Cor.
    12:9).
    *His prayer was earnest* (2Ch 20:12). “Neither know we what to do.”
    Sore distress means sure deliverance. Man’s extremity is God’s
    opportunity.
    *His prayer was expectant*. “Our eyes are upon Thee.” “Judah stood”
    (2Ch 20:12-13), Waiting in humble and believing expectation is sure
    to bring a hearty and bountiful blessing. Plead earnestly. Wait
    patiently. Trust fully. Shine brightly. Work expectantly. Behave
    wisely. Do manfully. Glorify God.

# 226. Jehovah in Psalm 27

1.  **Light,** to direct. “The Lord is my Light” (Psalm 27:1).
2.  **Salvation,** to deliver. “And my Salvation” (Psalm 27:1).
3.  **Strength,** to uphold. “The Lord is the Strength of my life”
    (Psalm 27:1).
4.  **Object** of desire. “One thing have I desired of the Lord” (Psalm
    27:4).
5.  **House** of shelter. “That I may dwell in the house of the Lord”
    (Psalm 27:4).
6.  **Beauty,** to admire. “The beauty of the Lord” (Psalm 27:4).
7.  **Teacher,** to instruct. “To enquire in His temple” (Psalm 27:4).
8.  **Protector,** to hide. “He shall hide me in His pavilion” (Psalm
    27:5).
9.  **Treasurer,** to keep. “In the secret of His tabernacle shall He
    hide me” (Psalm 27:5).
10. **Uplifter,** to save. “He shall set me up upon a rock” (Psalm
    27:5).
11. **Lord,** to worship. “I will sing praises unto the Lord” (Psalm
    27:6).
12. **Hearer** of prayer. “Hear, O Lord, when I cry” (Psalm 27:7).
13. **Director** of saints. “Seek ye My face” (Psalm 27:8).
14. **God** of salvation. “O God of my salvation” (Psalm 27:9).
15. **Gatherer** of forsaken. “The Lord will take me up” (Psalm 27:10).
16. **Leader,** to guide. “Lead me in a plain path” (Psalm 27:11).
17. **Goodness,** to bless. “The goodness of the Lord” (Psalm 27:13).
18. **Encourager,** to strengthen. “Be of good courage, and He shall
    strengthen thine heart” (Psalm 27:14).

# 227. Jehovah-Jireh

**The Lord will provide for every emergency.** When the knife was
uplifted by Abraham and about to be plunged into the heart of Isaac, God
stayed his hand and revealed Himself as Jehovah-Jireh in providing the
ram, which was offered up in the stead of Isaac. How we are reminded by
this of the Lord’s provision for the sinner in the death of Christ. The
believer in Christ can say, “He was offered up in the stead of me, even
as the ram in the stead of Isaac.” In temporal things as well as in
spiritual matters the Lord is our Jehovah-Jireh. He will surely supply
all our need. He will be our strength in weakness, our stay in sorrow,
and our song in sadness. The following acrostic on Jehovah-Jireh
illustrates in some measure what the Lord is to the believer:—

**J** **Justified** by His grace (Rom. 3:24).

**E** **Equipped** by His armour (Eph. 6:13).

**H** **Harboured** by His presence (Prov. 18:10).

**O** **Observed** by His eyes (Psalm 34:15).

**V** **Vitalized** by His life (Eph. 2:5).

**A** **Assisted** by His strength (Isaiah 41:10).

**H** **Honoured** by His name (1 John 3:1).

\

**J** **Joined** to Himself by His Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13).

**I** **Inspired** by His love (2 Cor. 5:14).

**R** **Raised** by His power (Eph. 2:6).

**E** **Encouraged** by His Word (Deut. 31:6, 8).

**H** **Helped** by His Spirit (Rom. 8:26).

\




# 228. Jehovah's Presence

DEUTERONOMY 1:33

THE cloud was the symbol of the Lord’s presence, and it was the secret
of Israel’s protection. Sometimes the cloud was *over* them; sometimes
*behind* them; and sometimes *before* them. Thus the Lord was over them
to shield; behind them to defend; and before them to lead. So He is with
us (Psalm 84:11; Psalm 91:4, 10; John 10:4). The Lord’s presence is the-

1.  **Salvation** from disquietude (Psalm 42:5, margin).
2.  **Shield** from strife (Psalm 31:20).
3.  **Secret** of our gladness (Psalm 95:2).
4.  **Secure** abode of the upright (Psalm 140:13).
5.  **Source** of our joy (Psalm 16:11).
6.  **Satisfier** of our need (Exodus 33:14).
7.  **Supporter** of our life (Isa. 63:9).
8.  **Supply** of our desire (Acts 3:19).

# 229. Jesus

THERE is no Gospel which brings out, in such a striking manner the
humanity of Christ, as the one which presents in such a remarkable way
the Deity of Jesus, namely, the Gospel according to John; and John 11 is
an illustration of this fact. This may be gathered if the name “Jesus”
is pondered over. It occurs no less than twenty-four times.

The **Attention** of Jesus (John 11:4).

The **Love** of Jesus (John 11:5).

The **Response** of Jesus (John 11:9).

The **Word** of Jesus (John 11:13).

The **Plainness** of Jesus (John 11:14).

The **Coming** of Jesus (John 11:17).

The **Approach** of Jesus (John 11:20).

The **Lordship** of Jesus (John 11:21).

The **Encouragement** of Jesus (John 11:23).

The **Unfolding** of Jesus (John 11:25).

The **Tarrying** of Jesus (John 11:30).

The **Person** of Jesus (John 11:32).

The **Eyes** of Jesus (John 11:33).

The **Sympathy** of Jesus (John 11:35).

The **Groaning** of Jesus (John 11:38).

The **Command** of Jesus (John 11:39).

The **Reminder** of Jesus (John 11:40).

The **Faith** of Jesus (John 11:41).

The **Direction** of Jesus (John 11:44).

The **Work** of Jesus (John 11:45).

The **Testimony** about Jesus (John 11:46).

The **Atonement** of Jesus (John 11:51).

The **Retirement** of Jesus (John 11:54).

The **Hunting** of Jesus (John 11:56).
# 230. Jesus

WHEN John Howard wanted to visit the prisons of Russia he sought an
interview with the Czar. He explained his object, and the Czar gave him
permission to visit any prison in his Empire. It was a long and weary
journey; he knew how jealously the prisoners were guarded, and how
averse the gaolers were to permit any one to visit them. But he set out
in perfect confidence. When he arrived at a prison he would make his
application, and was prepared for the refusal which invariably came.
Then he produced the Czar’s mandate, and the prison doors were
immediately opened to him. He had faith in that name, and was justified
by the results. In like manner, those who have faith in Him who bear the
name of Jesus, find that there is in that name—

**J    Justification** (Rom. 4:24-25).

**E    Eternal Life** (John 4:13-14).

**S    Salvation** (Matthew 1:21).

**U    Union** (John 12:24).

**S    Satisfaction** (John 7:37).
# 231. Jesus and John

WE note a sevenfold contrast between John and Jesus.

1.  John was the **harbinger** of Christ. Christ was the **One
    announced.** John went before to prepare for Christ’s coming.
2.  John was the **voice.** Jesus was the **Word.** John was the voice
    that spake the word. Trapp says, “John was all voice.….his apparel,
    his diet, his conversation did preach holiness as well as his
    doctrine” (Mark 6:20). John was a true voice, for he spake only of
    Jesus. He delighted to honour Him whom the Father honoureth. John is
    our example.
3.  John was the **forerunner.** Jesus was the **Lord.** John went
    before to announce the coming of Christ. His special mission was to
    reprove men of their sins, and to get them to repent of them (Matt.
    3:6). Christ came to save men from their sins (Matt. 1:21).
4.  John was the **herald.** Jesus was the **Person** spoken of. On the
    Day of Jubilee the priests blew the silver trumpets, and as their
    clarion notes rang out they told the people of redemption for the
    slave, rest for the weary, release for the debtor, and rejoicing for
    the sad (Lev. 25); so John comes to herald the approach of Him who
    was to give infinitefy more than the Year of Jubilee gave to the
    Israelites.
5.  John was the **testifier.** Jesus was the **Truth.** John’s
    testimony was clear and pointed. He gave no uncertain sound. On one
    occasion he said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
    of the world” (John 1:29).
6.  John was the **lamp.** Christ was the **Light.** Christ says of
    Himself, “I am the Light of the World” (John 8:12), and of John He
    says, “He was a burning and shining *light*,” or, as the Revised
    Version, “He was the *lamp* that burneth and shineth” (John 5:35).
    The word that Christ uses of Himself signifies light *underived*, as
    the light of the sun, hence that which shines by its own inherent
    power; but the word that Christ uses of John means the light of a
    lamp which is fed with oil, hence it is dependent upon something
    else for its being and shining. The lamp only burns as it is fed
    with oil. Could any two words describe in a more concise or clearer
    manner the truth that Christ is the Light dependent upon none, and
    that the servant of Christ can only be a light as he receives from
    Christ? Christ is essentially the Light of all knowledge, the Light
    of all holiness, the Light of all grace, the Light of all Love, the
    Light of all power, the Light of all joy, the Light of all truth,
    the Light of all compassion, and the Light of all righteousness; but
    we are in ourselves the very opposite to all that Christ is, and we
    can only resemble Him in any small degree as He ministers to us the
    oil of the grace of the Holy Spirit. He is the Minister who attends
    to the needs of His saints that they may shine for Him, even as the
    priest in the tabernacle continually supplied the lamps of the
    lampstand with oil that they might never go out (Lev. 24:2, 4).
7.  John was the baptizer in **water.** Jesus was and is the Baptizer in
    the **Holy Spirit** (John 1:33, R.V., M.).

# 232. Jesus at the Grave of Lazarus

1.  **The Sympathy of Jesus** (John 11:35). We might call this verse
    “Jesus wept,” the shortest verse in the Bible with the greatest
    meaning. The heart of Jesus ever beats in sympathy with the need of
    humanity, as His hand is ever ready to meet the need He sees. Mr.
    Spurgeon has well called this verse “a unique verse,” and said, “I
    have often felt vexed with the man, whoever he was, who chopped up
    the New Testament into verses. He seems to have let the hatchet drop
    indiscriminately here and there, but I forgive him a great deal of
    blundering for his wisdom in letting these two words make a verse
    for themselves, “Jesus wept.” This is a diamond of the first water,
    and it cannot have another gem set with it, for it is unique.
    Shortest of verses in words, but where is there a longer one in
    sense? Let it stand in solitary sublimity and simplicity.”\
     Three times we read of Jesus weeping. He wept tears of personal
    suffering (Heb. 5:7), tears of compassion (Luke 19:41), and here
    tears of sympathy.
2.  **The Command of Jesus** (John 11:39). There was a work which those
    who were standing by the grave had to do, before Christ spoke the
    life-giving word that raised Lazarus from the dead, and that was to
    remove the stone which lay at the tomb’s mouth. There are many
    stones that believers can roll away which keep the unsaved from
    hearing Christ’s voice. Here are some stones to roll away:—
    -   The rocky stone of ignorance.
    -   The granite stone of unbelief.
    -   The slaty stone of error.
    -   The lime-stone of prejudice.
    -   The hard stone of doubt.
    -   The slippery stone of inconsistency.
    -   The dazzling stone of fear.

3.  **The power of Jesus** (John 11:41-44). Disease, devils, and death
    had all to submit to Christ. The miracles of Christ in His earthly
    life are but illustrations of what He can do now in resurrection
    power by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel. Those
    who are dead in ceremonialism (Rev. 3:1) He can quicken; those who
    are buried in the pleasures of the world (1 Tim. 5:6) He can raise
    to delight in the pleasures that last for evermore (Psalm 16:11);
    those who are devoid of spiritual life and love, like the prodigal
    in the far country (Luke 15:24), He can robe and rejoice (Luke
    15:22-23); and those who, like the Ephesians, are ruled by the
    powers of darkness (Eph. 2:1-3; Acts 19:19) He can raise to the
    heavenly places (Eph. 2:6), and make them fight against the powers
    that once held them in their grip (Eph. 6:12).

# 233. Jesus Before the High Priest

MARK 14:53-64

IF there is one thing more than another that impresses one in the life
of Christ, it is the revealing power of His person, as He comes in
contact with men. His presence was the searchlight to shew men in their
real character.

There are seven characters in which Christ is seen in the portion of
Scripture before us.

1.  **The Passive Victim.** “They led Jesus away” (Mark 14:53; Isaiah
    53:7-8; Acts 8:32). There is no resistance on the part of Christ,
    but meekly and humbly He allows Himself to be led away. What majesty
    there is in His passiveness! With a look He could have made His
    enemies fall back (John 18:6); with a word He could have called
    twelve legions of angels to His aid (Matt. 26:53), and by His own
    power He could have escaped (Luke 4:30), but He wills to allow
    Himself to be in the hands of wicked men, that the purpose of God
    may be accomplished (Acts 2:23).
2.  **The Neglected Lord** (Mark 14:54). Where now is Peter’s
    willingness to go even to death with Christ (Mark 14:29)? Alas!
    Peter, instead of following close to the Lord (Psalm 63:8), is
    following “afar off.” Christ is neglected by the man who professed
    so much. How true are the words of Cecil, “Our very virtues, left to
    themselves, bear us down, like weights to destruction.”
3.  **The Falsely Accused** (Mark 14:55-59). There are three things
    about the false witnesses who spoke against Christ. They had to be
    sought or hired for the occasion; their witness was contradictory;
    and they told a lie in relation to the destruction of the Temple. If
    we compare John 2:19 with Mark 14:58, it will be found that Christ
    did not say that *He* would destroy the Temple, but if the Jews
    destroyed it, He would build it again in three days.
4.  **The Silent Saviour** (Mark 14:60-61). “He opened not His mouth” to
    vindicate Himself. He might have defended Himself from His false
    accusers. How truly was “silence golden” in the case of Christ, and
    herein the Holy Spirit points Him out to us as our Example (see 1
    Peter 2:21-23). Euripides was wont to say, “Silence was an answer to
    a wise man.” What an answer we may see in the silence of Christ, if
    we are made wise by the Spirit of wisdom.
5.  **The Blessed Christ** (Mark 14:61-62). Christ never hesitated to
    answer when the question touched His Deity. For Him not to answer
    then, would be to betray Himself. There is no hesitation in the
    reply of Christ when the High Priest asks Him if He is “The Christ.”
    Like a clear trumpet blast, the answer comes: “I Am.” Thus Christ
    says He is The Great I AM (Ex. 3:14). It has often been said that
    Christians claim for Christ what He never claimed for Himself,
    namely, that He was God. But if the “I AM’s” of Christ in the Gospel
    of John are studied, it will be seen that He claims to be God again
    and again.
6.  **The coming Man** (Mark 14:62). Christ proclaims that there is a
    day coming when He will be the Judge and not the judged; when
    Caiaphas will stand before Him, instead of Christ standing before
    Caiaphas; when the Prisoner will be the Potentate; when the Despised
    will be the Honoured One; and when the Weak One shall come in
    power.\
     There is no truth so prominent in the New Testament as the coming
    of the Lord Jesus, but of one thing we must be careful, and that is,
    to note the character in which He is coming. Here He says He will
    come as “The Son of Man,” and hence in judgment (John 5:27), and not
    in grace, as when He comes as our Hope (1 John 3:2-3), and Saviour
    (Phil. 3:20-21).
7.  **The Condemned Man** (Mark 14:64). They condemned the Son of Man,
    and God the Son, as being guilty of blasphemy, and therefore worthy
    of death. Can we not see beneath the hatred and cruelty of the
    authorities who condemned Christ to death, that He was delivered for
    our offences (Rom. 4:25), that we might be freed from condemnation
    (Rom. 8:1), and be able to say, “Who is he that condemneth” (Rom.
    8:34)?

# 234. Jesus Cleansing the Temple

JOHN 2:13-25

IT was perfectly right for the people to get their money exchanged, and
to buy and sell sheep, oxen, and doves, but it was wrong for these
things to be done in the house of the Lord. The priests were also to
blame in allowing these things to be within the precincts of the Temple.

1.  **Desecration** is the first thought to which I direct attention.
    The Temple was set apart for God’s worship and service, therefore to
    put it to a common use was to defile the house of God. Is not this
    an illustration of how sin has defiled man? God made man upright,
    like a beautiful temple, but by his inventions he has defiled the
    holy place of God. Our whole nature should be for the Lord. The
    outer court of the body with all its members, the inner court of the
    soul with all its affections, and the holy place of the spirit with
    all its capabilities. If we are *self-centred* we are desecrating
    the sacred shrine that has already been polluted by sin. If any one
    allows the idol of selfishness to be erected in his heart, he is a
    worse idolater than the heathen who bows down to blocks of wood and
    stone.
2.  **Expulsion** (John 2:15). “He drove them all out.” When Christ
    comes into the hearts and lives of those who believe in Him, He
    turns out all that is opposed to His will, and will keep every
    unholy thing out, as we allow Him to be Governor of our being, by
    sanctifying Him as Lord in our hearts (1 Peter 3:15, R.V.) A working
    man in the East End of London, in giving his experience, said, “When
    the Lord Jesus came into my heart, He turned out all the bad
    lodgers”; yes, and He will keep them out as well if we allow Him. We
    could not pray a better prayer than the little girl who said,
    “Please, Lord Jesus, come and live in my heart.” Some time after she
    thanked the Lord for having come in, in the following words, “Lord
    Jesus, I thank Thee that Thou hast come to live in my heart. Now,
    Lord, please shut the door.”
3.  **Question** (John 2:18). The Jews questioned Christ as to His
    authority for acting as He 999:They were blinded by prejudice, for
    as Trapp remarks, “They might have seen sign enough, in His so
    powerfully ejecting those money-changers. The disciples call it
    zeal, the Jews rashness.” The Jews were always asking for signs
    (Matt. 12:38; 16:4), and this was the one thing that kept them out
    of the power and blessing of the Gospel (1 Cor. 1:22).
4.  **Prediction** (John 2:19-21). Christ predicts His resurrection in
    His reply to the Jews. Godet remarks, “This answer of Jesus is
    sudden, like a flash of lightning. It springs from an immeasurable
    depth; it illuminates regions then completely unexplored by any
    other consciousness than His own. The words, ‘Destroy this temple,’
    characterise the present and future conduct of the Jews in its
    innermost significance, and the words, ’In three days I will raise
    it up,’ display all the grandeur of the Person and of the future
    work of Jesus.
5.  **Recollection** (John 2:22). In the meantime they murmured not,
    much less opposed; we can do nothing against the truth, when at the
    worst, “but for the truth” (2 Cor. 13:8). “They laid up what they
    understood not; and as the waters cast up the dead, so did their
    memories that which seemed dead therein, by the help of the Holy
    Ghost,” remarks Trapp. A good memory is a *blessing*, if we call to
    mind what the Lord has done (Deut. 8:2), but it is a *bane* if it is
    the “Son, remember” to bring back to memory the evil things one has
    done, or the good things not done (Luke 16:25).
6.  **Profession** (John 2:23). These believers are only make-believes.
    They have got the King’s head stamped on the coin of their
    profession, but the coin is made of base metal, therefore they are
    counterfeits. There was a great difference in the faith of the
    disciples mentioned in John 2:11, and the mere faith of assent to
    Christ’s power in these, as Godet remarks, “This faith had nothing
    inward and moral; it resulted solely from the impression of
    astonishment produced upon them by these wonders. *Signs* may,
    indeed, strengthen and develop true faith, where it is already
    formed, by displaying to it freely the riches of its object (John
    2:11). They may even, sometimes, excite attention, but not produce
    real faith. Faith is a moral act which attaches itself to the moral
    being of Jesus.”
7.  **Penetration** (John 2:24-25). The Holy Spirit seems to play upon
    the word “*believe*,” as the word “*commit*” in John 2:24, is the
    same as is translated “believe” in the other ninety-nine times in
    John’s Gospel. Christ did not commit (believe in) Himself to them,
    as they did not commit themselves to Him. As Luthardt says, “As they
    did not give themselves morally to Him, neither did He give Himself
    morally to them.”\
     In John 1 we behold Christ discerning a man who was true in heart,
    and to whom Christ committed Himself (John 1:48), but here He does
    not commit Himself because He knew that these disciples were not
    true to Him.

# 235. Jesus Saw

IT would be of interest to look through the Bible and note how active
the eyes of the Lord are (2 Chron. 16:9). I call attention to the seven
times that we read “Jesus saw” in the Gospel by John.

1.  He saw the **anxious enquirers,** and bade them come to and with Him
    (John 1:38).
2.  He saw the **devout worshipper,** and commended him (John 1:47-50).
3.  He saw the **impotent man,** and healed him (John 5:6).
4.  He saw the **hungry multitude,** and supplied their need (John 6:5).
5.  He saw the **weeping mourners,** and was troubled for them (John
    11:33).
6.  He saw the **distressed mother,** and cared for her (John 19:26).
7.  He saw the **blind man,** and revealed Himself as “The Light of the
    world” (John 9:1).

\




# 236. Jesus

The Name of Jesus in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

1.  As **Son of Man.** “But we see *Jesus*, who was made a little lower
    than the angels for the suffering of death” (Heb. 2:9).
2.  As our **High Priest.** “We have a great High Priest, who is passed
    into the heavens, *Jesus*, the Son of God” (Heb. 4:14, and 6:20).
3.  As our **Surety.** “By so much was Jesus made a Surety of a better
    testament” (Heb. 7:22).
4.  As the **Way** into the holiest. “Having therefore, brethren,
    boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus” (Heb.
    10:19).
5.  As the **Author of faith.** “Looking unto *Jesus*, the Author and
    Finisher of our faith” (Heb. 12:2).
6.  As our **Mediator.** “And to *Jesus* the Mediator of the new
    covenant” (Heb. 12:24).
7.  As our **Sanctifier.** “Wherefore *Jesus* also, that He might
    sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered without the gate”
    (Hebrews 13:12).

# 237. John and Herod

MARK 6:14-29

LET us note a few contrasts between John and Herod.

1.  **John was a faithful man; Herod was a faithless man.** The
    faithfulness of John is seen in that he rebuked Herod for living in
    sin (Mark 6:17-18). John was a man who had looked in the face of
    God; hence, he did not fear the frown of men. He who can speak with
    God in holy communion, will not fail in faithfulness to God, to tell
    men of their sins.\
     In contrast to John’s faith*ful*ness we have Herod’s
    faith*less*ness. In Mark 6:20 we are told that Herod feared and
    observed John, heard him gladly, and did many things, but after all
    Herod was only a stony ground hearer (Mark 4:16-17). Spurgeon says
    of Herod, “Herod was a foxy man. We sometimes meet with these foxy
    people. They want to go to heaven, but they like the road to hell.
    They will sing a hymn to Jesus, but a good roaring song they like
    also. They will give a guinea to the Church, but how many guineas
    are spent on their own lust. They try and dodge between God and
    Satan.….Herod was like a bird taken with lime-twigs; he wanted to
    fly; but, sad to say, he was willingly held, limed by his lust.”
2.  **John was a blessed man; Herod was a burdened man.** John was
    blessed in many ways. *John was a blessed man because of his
    character*. He was *pure* in heart, like a cleansed vessel, free
    from all contamination. He was *holy* in life, like the tabernacle,
    he was set apart for God’s indwelling and use; and he was
    *righteous* in action like an even balance, he did that which was
    right between men and God, and men and men. *John was a blessed man
    because he suffered for the sake of truth*. Those who suffer for the
    sake of Christ are blessed, as He Himself says (Matt. 5:11-12);
    their very shame is an occasion for rejoicing, as it is illustrated
    in the early Christians (Acts 5:41); and when any are called to seal
    their testimony with their death they are blessed indeed, for they
    receive the martyr’s crown of life (Rev. 2:10). *Herod was a
    burdened man*. Herod was burdened in many ways. *He was burdened
    with his sins*. He was living a shameful life and he knew it, but
    for all that he would not quit his sins. A load of guilt was upon
    him, and his iniquities hung about him like a mill-stone. *Herod was
    burdened with a troubled conscience*. When he heard of the miracles
    that Christ was doing, he thought that John had risen from the dead,
    and was troubled in consequence (Mark 6:14-17). When a man’s sins
    haunt him, he has a host of ghosts which make him afraid, and well
    they may. Joseph’s brethren could not forget the sins they had
    committed against their brother. Twenty years after the memory of
    their action is still fresh (Gen. 42:21), yea, even later than that
    (Gen. 50:17). Shakespeare represents, in a striking manner, the
    accusation of a guilty conscience in his scene in “Macbeth,” when he
    pictures Lady Macbeth trying to wash out the stain of blood from her
    hands. There is one stone in the floor of an old church in Scotland
    which stares out at you blood-red from the grey stones around it.
    The legend tells of a murder committed there, and of repeated
    fruitless attempts to cover the tell-tale colour of that stone.
    Morally the legend is true; every dead sin sends its ghosts to haunt
    the souls of the guilty. Committed sin is a *scar* that cannot be
    effaced, a *diamond-cut* that cannot be obliterated, a *mark* that
    cannot be rubbed out, a *stain* that cannot be washed out, an
    *impression* that is indelible, a *leak* that cannot be stopped, and
    a *burden* that cannot be removed-that is, from the human
    standpoint. All thing are possible with God, through faith in the
    atonement of Christ.

# 238. Jonah

THE Book of Jonah is like an album in which we have many likenesses of
Jonah.

1.  A runaway **prophet** (Jonah 1:3).
2.  A disobedient **servant** (Jonah 1:3).
3.  A sleeping **saint** (Jonah 1:5).
4.  A rebuked **believer** (Jonah 1:6).
5.  A marked **man** (Jonah 1:7).
6.  A **minister** of evil (Jonah 1:8).
7.  A true **witness** (Jonah 1:9).
8.  A conscious **offender** (Jonah 1:12).
9.  A “down-grade” **Christian** (Jonah 1:15).
10. A **substitute** (Jonah 1:15).
11. A type of **Christ** (Jonah 1:17; Matt. 12:40).
12. A **suppliant** (Jonah 2:1).
13. A distressed **sinner** (Jonah 2:2).
14. A prophetic **voice** (Jonah 2:5; Psalm 69:1-4).
15. A bargaining **pleader** (Jonah 2:9).
16. A restored **backslider** (Jonah 2:10).
17. A dull **scholar** (Jonah 3:1).
18. An obedient **servant** (Jonah 3:3).
19. A faithful **messenger** (Jonah 3:4).
20. A successful **evangelist** (Jonah 3:5).
21. A displeased **servant** (Jonah 4:1).
22. A discouraged **servant** (Jonah 4:3).
23. A questioned **disciple** (Jonah 4:4).
24. A watching **rebel** (Jonah 4:5).
25. A shadowed **servant** (Jonah 4:6).
26. A gladdened **servant** (Jonah 4:6).
27. A chastened **child** (Jonah 4:7).
28. A fainting **pilgrim** (Jonah 4:8).

# 239. Joseph's Name

WHAT Joseph was *called*. Joseph’s name was changed by Pharaoh to
Zepthnath-paaneah. There are quite a number of meanings given to this
name. In the Vulgate it is *Salvator Mundi*, which is *The Salvation* or
*The Saviour of the World*. *Gesenius* gives it as *The Prince of the
Life of the World*. *Brugsch*, *The Food of Life* or *The Food of the
Living*. Others view the term as really an Egyptian word in Hebrew
letters, and make it *The Governor of the abode of Him who lives*.
According to the margin of our Bible, it signifies *A Revealer of
Secrets*, or *The man to whom secrets are revealed*. The different
meanings may well be summed up, “The discoverer of hidden things,” or in
the Egyptian tongue, “The Saviour of the World.” Let us take up the
different meanings given above as illustrating what Christ is.

1.  **The Saviour of the World.** That Christ is the Saviour that God
    has appointed for the world, is stated again and again (John 3:16;
    4:42).
2.  **The Prince of the Life of the World.** “The Prince of Life” is one
    of Christ’s titles. As such He was killed by His enemies (Acts
    3:15), and is now in resurrection power quickening those who are
    dead in trespasses and sins.
3.  **The Food of Life.** “The Bread of Life” is another of Christ’s
    titles (John 6:35). Satisfaction is found in Christ as well as
    salvation.
4.  **The Food of the Living.** Those who are alive from the death of
    sin find there is food provided for them. “Give her something to
    eat,” were the words of Christ after He had given the young maiden
    life; and the Lord having given us life, provides nourishment for
    that life in Him who is “The Word of Life” through His written Word.
5.  **The Governor of the Abode of Him who Lives.** As Pharaoh appointed
    Joseph to be governor over all His domain, so the Father has
    committed all power into the hands of Christ, as He Himself says
    “All power (authority) is given Me in heaven and on earth” (Matt.
    28:18). “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into
    His hand” (John 3:35).
6.  **The Revealer of Secrets.** The Lord Jesus revealed to His
    disciples many things which had never been known before (Matt.
    13:11, 17). He still reveals His secrets through His Spirit and Word
    to those who are spiritually minded (1 Cor. 2:10), even as He made
    known His ways unto Moses (Psalm 103:7).
7.  **The Man to whom secrets are revealed.** It was because the Father
    had given the words to Christ that He was able to speak them out to
    others (John 14:24).

There is a sense, in a limited degree, in which what we have said of
Christ applies to the believer.

\




# 240. Joseph Sold into Egypt

GENESIS 37:28-36

WE look at Joseph as a type of Christ, and as an illustration of the
believer. There is one point to which we draw attention, namely, the
sufferings of Joseph.

*Joseph being ill-treated by his brethren, is a type of the
ill-treatment that Christ received at the hands of His brethren, and is
an illustration of what we must expect from those who are not the
Lord’s.*

There are seven things that Joseph’s brethren did to him. They *hated*
him (Gen. 37:4-5, 8), they *envied* him (Gen. 37:11), they *conspired*
against him (Gen. 37:18), they were going to *kill him* (Gen. 37:20),
they *stripped* him (Gen. 37:23), they *cast him into a pit* (Gen.
37:24), and they *sold* him to the Ishmaelites (Gen. 37:28). All this is
typical of the treatment that Christ received from His brethren
according to the flesh.

1.  **As Joseph was hated by his brethren, so was Christ, as He Himself
    says,** “They hated Me without a cause” (John 15:25). Joseph was
    hated because he was the special object of regard to his father
    (Gen. 37:4), because of his words (Gen. 37:8), and because of his
    dreams, which predicted his future glory. In like manner the Jews
    hated Christ. They hated Him because of His special relationship to
    the Father, and would have stoned Him (John 10:30, 33). They hated
    him because of the faithful words He uttered, and would have cast
    Him down headlong (Luke 4:28-29); and they hated Him because He
    spoke of His coming glory, and spit in His face, smote Him with
    their hands, and condemned Him to death (Matt. 26:64-67). We must
    not be surprised, therefore, if the world should hate us, for the
    Lord Himself has told us that this will be so (John 15:18-19), but
    this is our comfort that He telleth His Father and our Father about
    it (John 17:14).
2.  **As Joseph was envied by his brethren** (Gen. 37:11), **even so was
    Christ.** The Roman ruler, Pilate, saw very plainly that the motive
    power which was actuating the chief priests and elders when they
    brought Christ before him was envy (Matt. 27:18; Mark 15:10; John
    11:47-48), even as Joseph was envied by his brethren, to which envy
    reference is made by the Holy Spirit (Acts 7:9). Beware of envy, it
    is self-destructive. As Dr. Thomas once remarked, “I remember
    reading somewhere in a Grecian story of a man who killed himself
    through envy. His fellow-citizens had reared a statue to one of
    their number who was a celebrated victor in the public games. So
    strong was the feeling of envy which this incited in the breast of
    one of the hero’s rivals that he went forth every night in order, if
    possible, to destroy that monument. After repeated efforts he moved
    it from its pedestal, and it fell, and in its fall crushed him. An
    unintentional symbolic act was this, showing the suicidal action of
    envy on the soul. It is ever an element of misery, a burning coal
    which comes hissing hot from hell.”
3.  **As Joseph was conspired against** (Gen. 37:18), **even so was
    Christ.** The chief priests were continually plotting against the
    Lord Jesus. His teaching was a bright light, which revealed the
    hollowness of their utterances, and the unreality of their
    pretences, hence the reason of their ire against the Lord’s Anointed
    (Matt. 21:38; Mark 11:18; 12:12; Luke 19:47; 20:19). Judas was also
    used as a cat’s-paw by the priests and scribes, that they might get
    Christ into their power (Matt. 26:16; Mark 14:11); and they cared
    not what means they adopted to accomplish their diabolical purpose,
    for they even went the length of bribing false witnesses against the
    Son of God (Matt. 26:59; Mark 14:55). The servant is not above his
    Lord. As Christ was conspired against, even so was the Apostle Paul,
    as we read in the 23rd of the Acts. The same spirit is also
    manifested against God’s people, although in a less malignant form,
    by the world, but the same fire of hate lies smouldering, although
    it does not burst forth into flame.
4.  **As Joseph’s brethren sought to kill him** (Gen. 37:20), **even so
    the Jews repeatedly sought the life of Christ.** The evil purpose of
    the Jews to murder Christ, runs through the Gospel of John, like the
    black line that is often seen running across the face of a piece of
    white marble. (See John 5:16, 18; 7:1, 11, 19, 25, 30; 8:37, 40;
    10:39; 11:8, 57). The pure, white, noble, holy life of Christ was in
    such striking contrast to the lives of the scribes and Pharisees
    that they hated Him in consequence. Thus also will the world hate
    the child of God who is true to the truth of Christ with that hatred
    which is murder in the bud (1 John 3:15; Matt. 5:21-22).
5.  **As Joseph was stripped of his clothes** (Gen. 37:23), **even so
    was Christ.** In the Judgment Hall He was stripped to have the
    scarlet robe put on Him in mockery, and at the Cross the soldiers
    parted His raiment among them (Matt. 27:28, 35). Verily, like the
    man in the parable of the Good Samaritan, He fell among thieves, and
    they stripped Him of His clothes. Oh! what a sight for angels to
    look upon, their Maker to be stripped, naked, bleeding, and dying
    upon a cross! Many a child of God has been stripped by the bloody
    Inquisition and put upon the rack, or else stripped by wild beasts
    in the arena at Rome.
6.  **As Joseph was made a prisoner by being cast into the pit** (Gen.
    37:24), **so Christ was bound and kept in durance vile** (Mark
    15:1). Wonder of wonders that Christ should condescend to be bound
    by man! That the creature should imprison the Creator! The Prophet
    Isaiah, in speaking in general terms of the sufferings of Christ,
    says “He was taken from prison and judgment” (Isaiah 53:8). Many a
    servant of Christ has been cast into prison for the Gospel’s sake,
    as Paul and Silas were at Philippi (Acts 16), and as John Bunyan at
    Bedford.
7.  **As Joseph was sold for twenty pieces of silver** (Gen. 37:28),
    **even so was Christ for thirty pieces of silver sold by Judas who
    betrayed Him** (Matt. 27:3). No one can prayerfully ponder the
    sufferings of Christ without being influenced. His patience under
    provocation, and His whole attitude while in the hands of wicked men
    are most majestic, and remind us of a noble lighthouse around which
    the angry waves beat and hiss in vain. He is truly an Example for
    those who believe in Him to act in a similar way when persecuted for
    His sake (1 Peter 2:20-22). We must not forget that we are called to
    suffer for Christ, and with Him (Phil. 1:29; 3:10), as well as to
    reign with Him; yea, the place of glory is only reached by the path
    of suffering (Rom. 8:17).

# 241. Joshua and Service

JOSHUA 24:13-25

THE keynote of this Bible reading is the word “serve.” The children of
Israel are reminded whom they did serve (Josh 24:15), and whom they are
to serve. The expression, “serve the Lord,” or “serve Him,” occurs nine
times (Josh 24:14-15, 18-19, 21-22 and 24).

1.  **Salvation is the ground of service.** Israel testifies what the
    Lord had saved them from, namely, from the bondage and bitterness of
    Egyptian tyranny, and from the enemies which surrounded their path
    as they were journeying to Canaan (Josh 24:17-18); and as a
    consequence they recognise that they ought to serve the Lord. This
    same principle is emphasized in relation to the believer in Christ.
    We do not serve to be saved, but we are saved to serve (Eph.
    2:8-10). We are not to do to be forgiven, but we are forgiven to do.
    -   “Ah! nothing to do! for the sinner that’s dead
    -   Must needs have another to work in his stead;
    -   And Jesus, in Calvary’s terrible hour,
    -   Redemption accomplished in marvellous power.\
                      \*              \*              \*              \*
                     
    -   “Not a tittle of work till we’re saved from our sins,
    -   For that’s just the point where true service begins
    -   When the conscience is purged, and the heart is made glad,
    -   And the spirit set free that aforetime was sad.”

2.  **Separation is the forerunner of service.** The command of Joshua
    is clear and cutting: “Put away the gods” (Josh 24:14, 23). The
    vessels which God uses must be clean (Isaiah 66:20), and all who are
    associated with His service (Isaiah 52:11). We also must put away
    the idols of the love of the world (1 John 2:15), the pride of the
    flesh (3 John 9), the worship of man (1 Cor. 1:12), the energy of
    human method for the Lord’s work (1 Cor. 2:13-14), the love of money
    (1 Tim. 6:10), the exclusive affection for earthly friends (Luke
    14:26), and the applause of men (John 5:44). An idol is any object
    that comes in between us and the Lord, to the exclusion of Himself
    (1 John 5:21). The Lord cannot and will not use us in His service
    till we are wholly separated to Himself.
3.  **Sincerity and truth are essentials in service** (Josh 24:14). To
    serve the Lord “in sincerity and in truth” is to have two buttresses
    to the temple of our being, which give strength and beauty to it.
    There were two pillars to the Temple of Solomon, which were called
    Jachin and Boaz (1 Kings 7:21). The meaning of these names is
    suggestive. Jachin signifies “He will establish,” and Boaz means,
    “In Him is strength.” If we have in our character sincerity and
    truth, we shall have what these pillars signify, namely, strength of
    heart and life, and establishment of soul (Heb. 13:9), and shall
    thus be able to resist the onslaughts of evil and error, for we
    shall be like a house founded on a rock (Matt. 7:24).
4.  **Singleness of aim the strength of service.** The word of Joshua
    plays upon this one theme again and again-”Serve the Lord.” The Lord
    demands our absolute service. He will not permit us to divide our
    actions between Himself and someone else. “Whatsoever ye do, do it
    heartily as to the Lord” (Col. 3:23); “Whatsoever ye do, do all to
    the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31). “Do *all*” is the Divine call and
    claim. This reminds us that in our several relations we are
    privileged to serve the Lord, and that all we do we should do to
    Himself. The child in the home, in the school, and at play, the
    servant in the occupation, the mistress in the house, the master in
    the business, and the workman in the shop, are in their several
    duties to serve the Lord. How much better things would be done if in
    everything we did it as to, and for the Lord Himself!
5.  **Supply the incentive to service.** If the “therefore” of Josh
    24:14 is pondered in its context, it will be seen that the reason
    why the Lord calls for the service is found in what He had given. “I
    have given you,” &c.; “therefore fear the Lord and serve Him.” The
    gracious love of God in giving Israel the good land which they did
    not deserve was the incentive which should compel them to give
    themselves in whole-hearted service to the Lord. In like manner
    God’s love to us should constrain us to love Him; His faithfulness
    to us should be the magnetic force to cause us to be faithful to
    Him. Christ’s death for us should be the moulding power to make us
    die to sin; and His life should be the elevator to lift us to the
    plain of walking as He walked.

# 242. Joy

1.  Joy of **Salvation,** as we trust in Him. “Restore unto me the joy
    of Thy salvation” (Psalm 51:12).
2.  Joy of **Union,** as we abide in Him. “That My joy might remain in
    you, and that your joy might be full” (John 15:11).
3.  Joy of **Communion,** as we talk to, and listen to Him. “Did not our
    heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way” (Luke
    24:32).
4.  Joy of **Service,** as we work for Him. “So that I might finish my
    course with joy” (Acts 20:24).
5.  Joy of His **Presence,** as we look to Him. “Then were the disciples
    glad when they saw the Lord” (John 20:20).
6.  Joy of His **Word,** as we feed upon and obey Him. “Thy word was
    unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart” (Jer. 15:16).
7.  Joy of **Victory,** as we fight in Him. “Rejoice with great joy”
    (Neh. 12:43).
8.  Joy of **Suffering,** in fellowship with Him. “Rejoicing that they
    were counted worthy to suffer” (Acts 5:41).
9.  Joy of **Glory.** “Ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
    glory” (1 Peter 1:8).

\




# 243. Joy of the Lord

NEHEMIAH 8:10

THE joy of the Lord, not our joy in Him, is our strength.

1.  The joy of the Lord’s **compassion** is our strength in testimony,
    as we remember we are saved by Him (Luke 15:1-7).
2.  The joy of the Lord’s **treasure** (which is His people), is our
    strength in Christian life, as we recognise we are His property
    (Matt. 13:44).
3.  The joy of the Lord’s **Cross** is our strength in persecution, as
    we consider Him in prayerful meditation through His Word (Hebrews
    12:2-3).
4.  The joy of the Lord’s **oneness** with us is our strength in
    fruit-bearing, as we abide in Him (John 15:11).
5.  The joy of His **presence** is our strength in our walk, as we look
    to Him in faith (Psalm 105:43).
6.  The joy of His **joy** is our strength in communion as we have
    fellowship with Him (Zeph. 3:16-17).
7.  The joy of His **presentation** and commendation shall be our
    strength in glory to praise Him for all His grace given (Jude 24).

# 244. Joyful Ones

THERE are at least seven parties who rejoice at the repenting of a soul.

1.  The Father (Zeph. 3:17).
2.  The Son (Luke 15:6).
3.  The Holy Spirit (Luke 15:9).
4.  The angels (Luke 15:7).
5.  Loved ones (Heb. 12:23).
6.  The Church (Acts 15:3).
7.  The one who repents (Luke 15:24).

\




# 245. Justification

1.  Self-judgment is its **fore-runner.** “This man went down to his
    house justified” (Luke 18:14).
2.  God is its **Author.** “God that justifieth” (Rom. 8:33).
3.  Grace is its **Spring.** “Justified freely by His grace” (Romans
    3:24).
4.  Blood of Christ is its **Purchaser.** “Justified by His blood”
    (Romans 5:9).
5.  The resurrection is its **Proclaimer.** “Raised again for our
    justification” (Romans 4:25).
6.  Faith is its **Accepter.** “Being justified by faith” (Rom. 5:1).
7.  Union is its **Confirmation.** “He that is dead is freed (margin,
    justified) from sin” (Rom. 6:7).
8.  The Holy Spirit is its **Effector.** “Justified.….by the Spirit” (1
    Cor. 6:11).
9.  All things are in its **Scope.** “Justified from all things” (Acts
    13:39).
10. Works are its **Evidence.** “By works a man is justified” (James
    2:24).

\




# 246. Keep

1.  Keep the **sayings** of Christ. “If a man *keep* My sayings, he
    shall never see death” (John 8:51, 52).
2.  Keep the **commandments** of Christ. “If yeÂ·love Me *keep* My
    commandments” (John 14:15).
3.  Keep the **unity** of the Spirit. “Endeavouring to *keep* the unity
    of the Spirit” (Eph. 4:3).
4.  Keep **unspotted** from the world. “And to *keep* himself unspotted
    from the world” (James 1:27).
5.  Keep in the **love** of God. “*Keep* yourselves in the love of God”
    (Jude 21).
6.  Keep the **Faith.** “I have *kept* the faith” (2 Tim. 4:7).
7.  Keep **pure.** “*Keep* thyself pure” (1 Tim. 5:22).

\




# 247. Keep

1.  Keep yourselves in the **love of God.** “*Keep* yourselves in the
    love of God” (Jude 21).
2.  Keep yourselves from **Idols.** “Little children, *keep* yourselves
    from idols” (1 John 5:21).
3.  Keep unspotted from the **world.** “Pure religion . . . . . is
    this . . . . to *keep* himself unspotted from the world” (James
    1:27).
4.  Keep the **body** under. “But I *keep* under my body, and bring it
    into subjection” (1 Cor. 9:27).
5.  Keep the heart **diligently.** “*Keep* thy heart with all diligence;
    for out of it are the issues of life” (Prov. 4:23).
6.  Keep the Lord’s **commandments.** “If ye love Me, ye will *keep* My
    commandments” (John 14:15, R.V.).
7.  Keep from the **paths of the destroyer.** “I have *kept* me from the
    paths of the destroyer” (Psalm 17:4).

# 248. Keeping Christ's Words

JOHN 14:15, 21, 23

To keep Christ’s words is to evidence our love to Him. We should keep
His words and commands and observe His directions-

1.  **Faithfully,** as Adam was to keep the Garden of Eden (Genesis
    2:15).
2.  **Constantly,** as the eyelid does the eye (Psalm 17:8).
3.  **Wholly,** as the Levites kept the charge of the tabernacle
    (Numbers 3:7; 31:30, 47).
4.  **Diligently**, as Jonathan did in looking out for David’s enemies
    (1 Samuel 19:2).
5.  **Vigilantly,** as Saul’s messengers watched for David (1 Samuel
    19:11).
6.  **Attentively,** as we mark the example of a godly man and follow it
    (Psalm 37:37).
7.  **Carefully,** as God did Israel in bringing them to Canaan (Joshua
    24:17).

# 249. Keeping God's Word

THE good ground hearer, according to Luke, hears the Word God and keeps
it, and brings forth fruit (Luke 8:15). Thomas Watson, in his terse and
telling way says, “If you would hear the Word aright, be not only
attentive but retentive. Lay the Word up in your memories and hearts.
The seed on the good ground are they who, having heard the Word, keep
it.” The Greek word for “keep” signifies “to hold the word fast, that it
does not run away from us.” If the seed be not kept in the ground, but
is presently washed away, it is sown to little purpose; so, if the Word
preached be not kept in our memories and in our hearts, it is preached
in vain. Many people have memories like leaky vessels-the Word goes out
as fast as it comes in: how, then, can it profit? If a treasure be put
in a chest, and the chest be not locked, it may easily be taken away: a
bad memory is like a chest without a lock-the devil can easily take out
all the treasure.

1.  Keep the Word carefully as a **treasure** locked in the heart of
    warm love, as Jeremiah did, when he said, “Thy words were found, and
    I did eat them, and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of
    mine heart” (Jer. 15:16).
2.  Keep the Word as a **preventative**, as when the housewife puts the
    camphor among the clothes to keep the moth away (Psalm 119:11).
3.  Keep the Word as the **fire** is kept in the grate, then it will
    burn up the things not of God (Jer. 23:29).
4.  Keep the Word as the **miller** keeps the water running over the
    mill-wheel, then it shall keep us going (Isaiah 48:18).
5.  Keep the Word as the **mother** keeps the milk to nourish her child
    (1 Peter 2:2).
6.  Keep the Word as the **priest** kept the oil to make the lamps in
    the tabernacle burn (Lev. 24:2).
7.  Keep the Word as the **man** keeps the title-deeds to his house, for
    in the Word are found the title-deeds of our inheritance (1 Peter
    1:3-4).

# 250. Kept

PETER was kept by sixteen soldiers (Acts 12), but was not kept safely,
but the four quaternion power of Christ that keeps us is-

1.  **His finished Work in its fourfold aspect.**
    1.  *Godward.* God’s claims met and God glorified. “I have glorified
        Thee on the earth, I have finished the work” (John 17:4).
    2.  *Satanward.* Powers of hell defeated. “That He might destroy the
        works of the devil” (1 John 3:8).
    3.  *Worldward.* Separation from it. “Be not conformed to this
        world” (Rom. 12:2).
    4.  *Selfward.* Crucified and dead. “I am crucified with Christ”
        (Galatians 2:20).

2.  **His continual Work and Presence above.**
    1.  He is our *Representative* in whom we are represented. “To
        appear in the presence of God for us” (Heb. 9:24).
    2.  He is our *Intercessor* to plead on our behalf. “He ever liveth
        to make intercession for them” (Heb. 7:25).
    3.  He is our *Advocate* to look after our interests. “We have an
        Advocate with the Father” (1 John 2:1).
    4.  He is our *Saviour* to preserve to the end. “He is able also to
        save them to the uttermost” (Heb. 7:25).

3.  **His Gifts and Grace.**
    1.  His bestowed life. “Given to us eternal life, and this life is
        in His Son” (1 John 5:11).
    2.  His sufficient grace. “My grace is sufficient for thee” (2 Cor.
        12:9).
    3.  His mighty hand. “Kept by the power of God” (1 Peter 1:5).
    4.  His garrisoning peace. “And the peace of God . . . . shall keep
        your hearts and minds” (Phil 4:7).

4.  **His Promises.**
    1.  To be with us to the end. “Lo I am with you alway, even unto the
        end of the world” (Matt. 28:20).
    2.  To be with us by the Spirit. “By His Spirit that dwelleth in
        you” (Rom. 8:11).
    3.  To be for us at all times. “If God be for us, who can be against
        us” (Rom. 8:31).
    4.  To come again and receive us unto Himself. “I will come again
        and receive you unto Myself” (John 14:3).


# 251. Kept and Keeping

WE do the trusting, and the Lord does the keeping. We hold Him, because
He holds us. We cannot trust without Him, and yet, if we do not trust,
it is our, not His fault. Ralph Erskine sweetly says on this point-

“Mine arms embrace my God, yet I

Had never arms to reach so high;

His alone me holds, yet lo!

I hold, and will not let Him go.

\

“I do according to His call;

And yet not I, but He does all:

But though He works to will and do,

I without force work freely too.

\

“I take hold of His cov’nant free;

But find it must take hold of me.

I’m bound to keep it, yet ’tis bail

And bound to keep me without fail.”

\

1.  **Purity and Preservation.** “*Keep* thy tongue from evil” (Psalm
    34:13). “*Keep* the door of my lips” (Psalm 141:3). “All God’s
    commands are God’s enablings,” and in the first Scripture we have a
    command in reference to the tongue; it is a *little* member, but it
    may do a great deal of mischief. It is the *little* foxes that spoil
    the vine. It is a *little* leaven, that leavens the whole lump. It
    is the little back-bitings and evil speakings that do harm to our
    own souls as well as to others. Let us by a definite act surrender
    our tongue to the Lord that He may keep the door of our lips, thus
    our speech will always be with grace.
2.  **Patient and Possessed.** “*Keep* thy heart with all diligence”
    (Prov. 4:23). “Thou wilt *keep* him in perfect peace, whose mind is
    stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee” (Isaiah 26:3). Keep the
    heart patiently stayed upon the Lord, and He will keep in perfect
    rest, for perfect trust in the perfect keeping power of Christ
    brings perfect peace.
3.  **Prayer and Provision.** “O *keep* my soul” (Psalm 25:20). “He
    shall give His angels charge over thee, to *keep* thee in all thy
    ways” (Psalm 91:11). We receive not because we ask not, and very
    often we ask and receive not, because we ask amiss; some known sin
    indulged in or unbelief will keep back the answer. There is
    provision for all our need in Christ. The soul has two hands, the
    empty hand of prayer, and the receiving hand of faith.
4.  **Practice and Promise.** “I have *kept* the faith” (2 Tim. 4:7).
    “Because thou hast *kept* the word of My patience, I also will
    *keep* thee from the hour of temptation” (Rev. 3:10). Christ has
    given us His word to keep, and we are to keep it at all costs; to
    keep it, and to be kept by it; to live it, and live by it; to preach
    it by life and lips; not to compromise or yield one iota. What God
    wants of us is faithfulness, even as a lady writing in the fly-leaf
    of a Bible given to an evangelist, said, “Do well, suffer for it,
    take it patiently, till you hear the Master’s well done.”
5.  **Power and Power.** “*Keep* yourselves from idols” (1 John 5:21).
    “*Kept* by the power of God” (1 Peter 1:5). The first is the power
    of a separate walk. “What is self-surrender?” asked a young lady
    recently. “It is the surrender of self,” was the reply, and it is
    only those who have surrendered themselves to Christ who know
    anything of His keeping, subduing, and sanctifying power.
6.  **Protected and Protection.** “*Keep* My words” (John 14:23). “Peace
    of God, which passeth all understanding, shall *keep*,” &c. (Phil.
    4:7). Obedience is the source of constant joy, implicit trust is the
    source of constant peace. If we would be protected from the wiles of
    the devil, and overcome him, we must keep the words of Christ, for
    Satan cannot stand before the charge, “It is written.” And if we
    would have our hearts and minds guarded as with a military guard,
    and thus have thorough protection, we must be careful for nothing,
    prayerful about everything, and thankful for anything, then the
    peace of God shall garrison and keep our hearts and minds in Christ
    Jesus.
7.  **Privilege and Perseverance.** “Able to *keep*” (2 Tim. 1:12).
    “That good thing which was committed unto thee, *keep* by the Holy
    Ghost” (2 Tim. 1:14). “*Keep* yourself in the love of God” (Jude
    21). God’s love has been perfected in our unworthiness, and His
    strength is perfected in our weakness. If we would know the power of
    God, we must trust Him; if we would know the guidance and power of
    the Spirit’s presence, we must recognise Him; if we would realize
    the warmth of God’s love, we must abide in Him.

Let us ever recognise the two sides of truth, for it is only as we keep
ourselves in the power of God that we know His power to keep.

\




# 252. Kept by the Lord

II. SAMUEL 22:44

THE king of Israel acknowledged that the Lord had kept him in the
position he occupied as the head of the nations. God does not promise to
keep the believer in earthly honour and position, but He is keeping us
for Christ (Jude 1, R.V.), and the inheritance that shall never pass
away (1 Peter 1:5).

1.  He keeps us as a **garrison**, securely (Phil. 4:7).
2.  As a **gardener**, attentively (Isaiah 27:3).
3.  As a **treasurer**, carefully (1 Peter 1:5).
4.  As a **parent**, lovingly (John 17:11).
5.  As a **shepherd**, guardingly (1 Peter 2:25).
6.  As a **casket**, secretly (1 John 5:18, R.V.)
7.  As the **eye-lid** the eye, instantly (Psalm 17:8).

# 253. Landmarks

ONE of the commands of Jehovah to Israel was, that they were not to
remove the landmarks of their neighbour (Deut. 19:14, 27:17). Even more
significant are the terse and telling terms which we find in Exodus 12,
13, and 14, as indicating the landmarks of God’s grace to His people,
and what He expects from them. There are seven terms which we may call
the seven landmarks of Christian experience.

1.  **The “Take” of Faith.** “*Take*…a lamb.” “*Take* of the blood” (Ex.
    12:3, 7). Faith takes the Pascal Lamb of God’s appointing, and finds
    in His blood its blessing.
2.  **The “Eat” of Satisfaction.** “*Eat* the flesh,” &c. (Ex. 12:8)
    Christ is the soul’s Food as well as its Salvation (see John
    6:53-58).
3.  **The “Shall not” of Assurance.** “The plague *shall not* be upon
    you (Ex. 12:13). When we have God’s “shall not” we are safe (John
    5:24; Rom. 6:14).
4.  **The “Put away” of Separation.** “*Put away* leaven” (Ex. 12:15).
    The leaven of wickedness must be entirely separated from the
    believer (1 Cor. 5:6-8).
5.  **The “Sanctity” of Dedication.** “*Sanctify* unto Me” (Ex. 13:2).
    Separation to God Himself, to all He is, has, and desires, is the
    essence of consecration.
6.  **The “Stand still” of Obedience.** “*Stand still* and see the
    salvation of the Lord” (Ex. 14:13). To obey the direction of the
    Lord is our highest service.
7.  **The “Go-forward” of Progress.** “*Go forward*” (Ex. 14:15). To
    advance in the Divine life is the evidence of soul prosperity.
    Stagnation is a proof of death.

mentioned in the Gospel according to John.

1.  **Committal of Love.** “The Father *loveth* the Son, and hath given
    all things into His hand” (John 3:35).
2.  **Complacency of Love.** “Therefore doth My Father *love* Me,
    because I lay down My life” (John 10:17).
3.  **Communion of Love.** “As the Father hath *loved* Me, so have I

4.  **Co-equality of Love.** “Thou.….hast *loved* them, as Thou hast
    loved Me” (John 17:23).
5.  **Character of Love.** Eternal. “Thou *lovedst* Me before the
    foundation of the world” (John 17:24).

    may be in them” (John 17:26).

    Him all things that Himself doeth” (John 5:20).

\




# 272. Made in Christ

THERE are many things the believer is said to be “made” in Christ. Sin
had *un*made us, but grace *re*makes us.

1.  “**Made nigh.**” Nearness. “*Made* nigh by the blood of Christ”
    (Eph. 2:13).
2.  “**Made righteous.**” Righteousness. “*Made* the righteousness of
    God in Him” (2 Cor. 5:21).
3.  “**Made white.**” Purity or Holiness. “Washed their robes and *made*
    them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Rev. 7:14).
4.  “**Made accepted.**” Favoured. “*Made* us accepted in the Beloved”
    (Eph. 1:6). The word “accepted” only occurs in one other place in
    the New Testament, and that is in Luke 1:28, where it is rendered
    “*highly favoured*,” or as the margin, “*graciously accepted, or
    much graced*.”
5.  “**Made meet.**” Sufficiency. “*Made* us meet to be partakers of the
    inheritance of the saints in light” (Col. 1:12). The term “*meet*”
    is rendered in 2 Cor. 3:6, “*hath made able*,” or sufficient.
6.  “**Made heirs.**” Heirship. “Being justified by His grace, we should
    be *made* heirs” (Titus 3:7).
7.  “**Made kings and priests.**” Nobility. “*Made* us kings and priests
    unto God and His Father” (Rev. 1:6).



# 273. Man Full of Grace

ACTS 6:8, R.V.

THOSE who are full of grace are-

1.  **Responsive to grace.** “Helped them much, which had believed
    through *grace*” (Acts 18:27).
2.  **Built up by grace.** “I commend you to God, and to the word of His
    *grace*, which is able to build you up” (Acts 20:32).
3.  **Testify of grace.** “To testify the Gospel of the *grace* of God”
    (Acts 20:24).
4.  **Dependent upon grace.** “We believe that through the *grace* of
    the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved” (Acts 15:11).
5.  **Holy through grace.** “Great *grace* was upon them all” (Acts
    4:33).
6.  **Continue in grace.** “Persuaded them to continue in the *grace* of
    God” (Acts 13:43).
7.  **Evidenced by grace.** “When he had seen the *grace* of God, was
    glad” (Acts 11:23).

# 274. Man of Faith

ACTS 6:5

FAITH is the root grace that unites the soul to the soil of God’s love
and power, and causes all the other graces to flourish, hence a “man
full of faith” is a-

1.  **Man of Prayer,** as Elijah was. “Elias was a man . . . . he prayed
    earnestly” (James 5:17).
2.  **Man of Work,** as Noah was. “By faith Noah . . . . prepared an
    ark” (Heb. 11:7).
3.  **Man of Obedience,** as Abram was. “Abraham, when he was
    called . . . . went out not knowing whither he went” (Heb. 11:8).
4.  **Man of Communion,** as Enoch was. “By faith Enoch…pleased God”
    (Heb. 11:5-6).
5.  **Man of Separation,** as Moses was. “By faith he forsook Egypt,”
    &c. (Heb. 11:25-28).
6.  **Man of Victory,** as David was. “I come to thee in the Name of the
    Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast
    defied” (1 Sam. 17:45).
7.  **Man of Faithfulness,** as Samuel was. “Samuel said unto him, the
    Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day” (1 Samuel
    15:28, 33).

# 275. Manifestations of the Lord

THE Lord Jesus has told us that if we keep His words He will manifest
Himself to us (John 14:21). There are certain conditions which must be
observed by us if we would have manifestations of, and from the Lord.

1.  The manifestation of His **power** is conditional upon our waiting
    on the Lord in prayer (Acts 1:8, 14; 2:4).
2.  The manifestation of His **joy** is conditional upon our abiding in
    Christ (John 15:10-11).
3.  The manifestation of His **peace** is conditional upon carefulness
    for nothing, prayerfulness in everything, and thankfulness for
    anything (Phil. 4:6-7).
4.  The manifestation of His **knowledge** is conditional upon doing
    God’s will (John 7:17).
5.  The manifestation of His **purpose** is conditional upon walking
    with the Lord (Psalm 103:7).
6.  The manifestation of His **love** is based upon dwelling in God (1
    John 4:16).
7.  The manifestation of His **glory** is given to those who are taught
    by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 2:9-10).

# 276. Manner of God's Love

I. JOHN 3:1

The manner of His love-

1.  He loves as a Father (1 John 3:1). Heartily.
2.  He loves as a Mother (Gen. 25:28). Tenderly.
3.  He loves as a Bridegroom (Gen. 24:67). Earnestly.
4.  He loves as a Brother (John 15:9). Affectionately.
5.  He loves as a Shepherd (Luke 15:4-6). Perseveringly.
6.  He loves as a Husband (Eph. 5:25). Devotedly.
7.  He loves as a Sister (John 11:32). Sincerely.
8.  He loves as a Friend (Prov. 17:17). Constantly.


# 277. Melchisedek

THERE is a difference between atonement and priesthood-

1.  Atonement is a thing of death, and priesthood a thing of life.
2.  Atonement is once for all, finished; priesthood is continuous.
3.  Atonement was accomplished on earth, priesthood is carried on in
    heaven.
4.  Atonement is for the sinner, and priesthood for the saint.

Christ is a priest after the order of Melchisedek. Melchisedek was
without father or mother in a priestly sense, *i.e.*, his priesthood was
of a different order from Aaron’s, which depended on descent and
genealogy, and lasted for a definite period. Christ is the Eternal One.
His priesthood begins and ends with Himself.

It is interesting to note the three things that Melchisedek did when he
met Abraham (Gen. 14:18-20).

1.  **He brought forth bread and wine to him.** Bread is strengthening
    and wine is symbolical of joy. Our High Priest ministers to us His
    own word and joy.
2.  **He blessed him.** We are blessed in our High Priest. We read that
    when Christ was about to ascend to heaven, He led His disciples as
    far as Bethany, and there, with uplifted hands, He blessed them
    (Luke 24:50). We never read that those hands were put down.
3.  **He received from Abraham a tenth** of what he had taken. Our High
    Priest waits for our gifts and offerings. There are four we can
    give-
    1.  Our **bodies** (Romans 12:1).
    2.  Our **service** (Phil. 2:17; Heb. 13:16).
    3.  Our **money** (Phil. 4:18).
    4.  Our **praise** (Heb. 13:15).

# 278. The Mercy of the Lord

As God had mercy on Nineveh, so He has had mercy upon us. It is for us
to believe in, and accept His mercy, by accepting Christ.

Think of the character of His mercy.

1.  **His mercy is great** (Num. 14:18; Psalm 103:11; 145:8). It is
    great, because the Father is the Source of it; it is great, because
    of the price it cost before it could reach us, for sin had blocked
    up the way. The cost was the blood of Christ.
2.  **His mercy is enduring** (1 Chron. 16:34, 41; 2 Chron. 5:13; 7:3,
    6; 20:21; Ezra 3:11; Psalm 106:1; 107:1; 118:1; 136:1 to the end;
    and Jer. 33:11). Having put His hand to the plough, He never looks
    back.
3.  **His mercy is plenteous** (Psalm 86:5, 15; 103:8). He does not dole
    it out grudgingly, but showers it upon us abundantly.
4.  **His mercy is tender** (Luke 1:78). He has mercy upon us, not as a
    judge, but as a Father.
5.  **His mercy is rich,** or He is rich in mercy (Eph. 2:4). He keeps
    not the riches of His mercy to Himself, but, like Joseph, who gave
    of his abundance to his brethren, even so the Lord gives us of His
    fulness.
6.  **His mercy is saving** (Titus 3:5). We should never have been saved
    if our salvation had depended upon ourselves; but He held out the
    sceptre of mercy to us, as Ahasuerus did to Esther.
7.  **His mercy is abundant** (1 Peter 1:3). It is not like a brook that
    dries up in the summer, but like the sea, which is unlimited. His
    mercy shall be as an attendant to accompany us (Psalm 23:6), and as
    an army to encompass us (Psalm 32:10).

# 279. Mighty God

ISAIAH 9:6
----------

HE is mighty in many ways. His mighty acts declare His power.

1.  He is mighty to **save** (Isaiah 63:1).
2.  He is mighty to **deliver** (Deut. 3:24: 7:8, 19).
3.  He is mighty to **conquer** (Joshua 4:24; 2 Cor. 10:4).

5.  He is mighty to **use** in His **service** (Col. 1:29).
6.  He is mighty in **word** (Luke 24:19).
7.  He is mighty in **work** (Mark 6:2).

# 280. Mind of Christ

1.  **Stedfast** mind, and Christ the **Power.** “That ye stand fast in
    one spirit with one *mind*” (Phil. 1:27).
2.  **Loving** mind, and Christ the **Principle.** “Like-*minded*,
    having the same love” (Phil. 2:2).
3.  **Humble** mind, and Christ the **Pattern.** “Let this *mind* be in
    you, which was also in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5).
4.  **Unselfish** mind, and Christ the **Passion.** “Like-*minded*.…all
    seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ’s” (Phil.
    2:20-21).
5.  **Developed** mind, and Christ the **Progress.** “If ye be otherwise
    *minded*, God shall reveal even this unto you” (Phil. 3:15).
6.  **Guarded** mind, and Christ the **Peace.** “The peace of God.…keep
    your hearts and *minds*” (Phil. 4:7).
7.  **Musing** mind, and Christ the **Pathway.** “Whatsoever things are
    true.….*think* on these things” (Phil. 4:8, R.V.).

# 281. Ministry of Angels

THERE are many things the Lord does through the ministry of angels. The
following are a few out of the many-

1.  Angels **guide in difficulty,** as seen in Eleazer’s mission. “He
    shall send His angel before thee” (Gen. 24:7, 40).
2.  Angels **deliver from evil,** as Jacob testifies. “The Angel which
    redeemed me from all evil” (Gen. 48:16).
3.  Angels **commission in work,** as is evidenced in Gideon. “There
    came an angel of the Lord” (Judges 6:11, 22).
4.  Angels **encourage in despondency,** as we gather from Elijah when
    under the juniper tree. “As he lay and slept under a juniper tree,
    behold then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat”
    (1 Kings 19:5, 7).
5.  Angels **shield from harm** by their presence, as David assures us.
    “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and
    delivereth them” (Psalm 34:7).
6.  Angels **defeat our adversaries,** as we have illustrated in
    Hezekiah’s deliverance from Sennacherib. “Then the angel of the Lord
    went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians,” &c. (Isaiah
    37:36).
7.  Angels **preserve in the midst of danger,** as we have demonstrated
    in the cases of the three Hebrew young men and Daniel. “Who hath
    sent His angel and delivered His servants” (Daniel 3:28; 6:22).

\




# 282. Moriah

THERE are many typical characters in the Book of Genesis. *Adam*,
typical of Him who is the last Adam, the Lord from Heaven.
*Melchisedek*, typical of our High Priest. *Joseph*, typical of Christ
as the Ruler and Provider. *Isaac*, typical of Christ as the Obedient
One, even unto death.

1.  **Moriah, the typical place.** (Genesis 22; John 3:16). There are
    many truths we might gather, but we point out this one.
    1.  *The love of Abraham for Isaac* (Gen. 22:2). The first time the
        word “lovest” occurs in the Bible, is here, and it is typical of
        the love the Father has for Christ.
    2.  *The obedience of Isaac.* He did not hesitate, but went at once.
        This is typical of Christ, who was obedient unto death (Phil.
        2:8).
    3.  *The unity between Abraham and Isaac.* “They went both of them
        together” (Gen. 22:6). This is typical of the unity there was
        between the Father and Christ. He finished the work the Father
        gave Him to do, and it was with, and by the Father He did the
        work.
    4.  *The burden of Isaac* (Gen. 22:6). In Bagster’s Bible, the
        reference is John 19:17. It is significant. There we are told
        that Christ bare His cross, just as Isaac bore the wood. The
        cross is what Christ endured at the hands of man; but, as Peter
        said on the day of Pentecost, they were only carrying out the
        purpose of God.
    5.  *Isaac upon the Altar.* He is in figure offered up, but Christ
        was in reality. “Hath given Himself for us, an Offering and a
        Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour” (Eph. 5:2).
    6.  *Isaac is in figure received from the dead* (Heb. 11:19). Christ
        was raised from the dead in reality.
    7.  *The ram offered in the stead of Isaac* (Gen. 22:13). Here we
        have substitution. Christ has died instead of every believer,
        and they shall never die for their sins. Distinguish between
        provision and substitution. Christ has made provision for all,
        by His death, but it is only those who receive Him that get the
        benefit of His work.

2.  **Moriah, the place of sin, judgment, and mercy** (1 Chron. 21)
    David’s sin was in numbering the people without the atonement money.
    The Lord was displeased with David for numbering the people, and
    sent a pestilence that destroyed 70,000 of them. Why did God thus
    deal with His servant? Was David wrong in numbering the people? We
    think not. Where was the evil? In this. In Exodus 30:12, it says,
    “When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, after their
    *number*, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto
    the Lord, when thou *numberest* them; that there be no plague among
    them, when thou *numberest* them.” Now the sin of David was, that he
    did not call for the atonement money, and hence he broke a distinct
    command of God, and the consequent plague followed. What a rebuke to
    those who, to-day, are scouting the atonement, and pooh-poohing the
    blood-theology! As surely as the judgment fell upon Israel for their
    disobedience, so surely will it fall upon all those who scout the
    blood of Christ; for verily they trample beneath their feet the
    blood of God’s dear Son, and God shall treat them likewise. When
    David found out how he had sinned, he went up to the threshing-floor
    of Ornan, and there offered burnt and peace offerings; and then, and
    not till then, the angel put up his sword, and the plague ceased.
    The offering comes in between the offended and the offender, and the
    fire coming down upon the offering tells that the offended is
    satisfied and the offender is accepted.
3.  **Moriah, the place of purchase** (1 Chron. 21:24-25; Eph. 1:7-14).
    David bought the threshing-floor of Ornan, and the oxen for fifty
    shekels of silver (2 Sam. 24:24); and the site of the Temple for six
    hundred shekels of gold (1 Chron. 21:25). David buying the site for
    the Temple reminds us of Christ, who has redeemed us, who believe in
    Him, not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with His
    own precious blood. And as Moriah was purchased to erect a dwelling
    for God, so the believer is redeemed to be indwelt by the Holy
    Spirit.
4.  **Place of progress** (1 Kings 6:7; Eph. 2:19-22). The building of
    the Temple is an illustration of the growth of the believer in
    Christ, and also the progress of the Church as a whole. Every sinner
    saved is another stone in the holy building.\
     In 2 Peter 1:5-7, we have the building up of the character of the
    believer. Faith is the first stone on the foundation, and love is
    the top-stone. We might call these so many stones of faith:—
    Virtue is faith undaunted.
    Knowledge is faith apprehending.
    Temperance is faith overcoming.
    Patience is faith untiring.
    Godliness is faith imitating.
    Brotherly kindness is faith in practice.
    Love is faith at work.

# 283. Must

THIS word speaks the necessity of the truth declared.

1.  **The must of worship Him.** “They that worship Him *must* worship
    Him in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24).
2.  **The must of work.** “I *must* work the works” (John 9:4).
3.  **The must of purpose.** “Them also I *must* bring” (John 10:16).
4.  **The must of regeneration.** “Ye *must* be born again” (John 3:7).
5.  **The must of sacrifice.** “Even so *must* the Son of Man be lifted
    up” (John 3:14; 12:34).
6.  **The must of resurrection.** “He *must* rise again from the dead”
    (John 20:9).
7.  **The must of increase.** “He *must* increase, but I must dscrease”
    (John 3:30).

\




# 284. Names of Believers

IT is a most profitable study to note the names that are given to
believers, for as the names of God denote His character and claims, so
the names of believers denote their calling in Christ and what their
character should be before Him.

 **A Ambassadors** 
:   to represent God in the world. “We are ambassadors for Christ” (2
    Cor. 5:20).
 **B Branches** in Christ, the Vine, 
:   for the Spirit of God to manifest His fruitfulness through them. “I
    am the Vine, ye are the branches” (John 15:5).
 **C Citizens** of heaven 
:   in a strange land, which they are travelling through.
    “Fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God” (Eph.
    2:19).
 **D Disciples** 
:   following Christ,their Master, and listening to Christ, their
    Teacher. “Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after Me,
    cannot be My disciple” (Luke 14:27).
 **E Elect** ones of God 
:   for His use and glory. “Elect of God, holy and beloved” (Col. 3:12).
 **F Friends** of Christ, 
:   to have fellowship with Him and lovingly to do as He bids. “Ye are
    My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you” (John 15:14).
 **G Garden** 
:   enclosed as His own propertyfor His delight and satisfaction. “A
    garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse” (Song of Solomon 4:12).
 **H Heirs** of God, 
:   joint heirs with Christ, to enjoy what they have with Him. “Heirs of
    God and joint heirs with Christ . . . . that we may be also
    glorified together” (Rom. 8:17).
 **I Instruments** 
:   to be fitted and used at His disposal. “Sanctified and meet for the
    Master’s use” (2 Tim 2:21).
 **J Jewels** 
:   that are precious and priceless to Him. “They shall be Mine, saith
    the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels” (Mal.
    3:17).
 **K Kings.** 
:   Made so by His grace to reign with Christ in His kingdom. “Made us
    kings and priests unto God and His Father” (Revelation 1:6).
 **L Lights** 
:   to reprove sin by their holiness, to represent Christ by their
    harmony with His will and Word. “Ye are the light of the world. Let
    your light so shine,” &c. (Matt. 5:14, 16).
 **M Members** of Christ’s body 
:   as to their union with Him, and hence members one of another. “For
    we are members of His body” (Eph. 5:30). “We are members one of
    another” (Eph. 4:25).
 **N New Creatures** in Christ Jesus, 
:   as reminding them of the new position they enjoy in Him, and the new
    practice they are to exemplify by Him. “If any man be in Christ he
    is a new creature” (2 Cor. 5:17).
 **O Offerers** to Him 
:   of themselves-spirit, soul, and body; their praise and prayers.
    “That ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
    unto God, which is your reasonable service” (Romans 12:1).
 **P Pilgrims** and strangers, 
:   hence they have nothing in common with the world, nor wish to. “I
    beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts” (1
    Peter 2:11).
 **R Redeemed** ones, 
:   as those who have been purchased and liberated. “Ye were not
    redeemed with corruptible things.….but with the precious blood of
    Christ” (1 Peter 1:18).
 **S Stewards,** 
:   in their responsibility to God. “Occupy till I come” (Luke 19:13).
 **T Temple** of God, 
:   being indwelt by the Holy Spirit. “Know ye not that ye are the
    temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” (1 Cor.
    3:16).
 **U Undefiled** 
:   as to what the Lord calls them, because He sees them in Christ (Song
    of Solomon 4:7).
 **V Vessels of mercy,** 
:   as partakers of His grace. “That He might make known the riches of
    His glory on the vessels of mercy” (Romans 9:23).
 **W Worshippers,** 
:   as to their adoration and admiration of the Lord in His greatness
    and goodness. “O that men would praise the Lord for His goodness”
    (Psalm 107:8).



# 285. Nine Nots

ROMANS 13:8-14

1.  THE “not” of **uncleanness.** “Thou shalt *not* commit adultery”

    John 3:15).
3.  The “not” of **stealing.** “Thou shalt *not* steal” (Mal. 3:8-10).
4.  The “not” of **false witness.** “Thou shalt *not* bear false
    witness” (Col. 3:9).
5.  The “not” of **coveting.** “Thou shalt *not* covet” (Col. 3:5).
6.  The “not” of **rioting and drunkenness.** “*Not* in rioting and
    drunkenness” (Eph. 5:18).
7.  The “not” of **chambering and wantonness.** “*Not* in wantonness and
    chambering” (Eph. 4:29).

    (1 Peter 2:1-2).
9.  The “not” of the **flesh.** “Make *not* provision for the flesh,”
    &c. (Gal. 5:24).

# 286. Obedience

1.  OBEDIENCE of **faith.** “A great company of the priests were
    *obedient* to the faith” (Acts 6:7).
2.  Obedience of **love.** “If ye love Me *keep* My commandments” (John
    14:15).
3.  Obedience to **death.** “Became *obedient* unto death” (Phil. 2:8).
4.  Obedience to **Christ.** “Bringing into captivity every thought to
    the *obedience* of Christ” (2 Cor. 10:5).
5.  Obedience unto **righteousness.** “Of *obedience* unto
    righteousness” (Rom. 6:16).
6.  Obedience is **remembered.** “He remembereth the *obedience* of you
    all” (2 Cor. 7:15).
7.  Obedience is **spoken of.** “Your *obedience* is come abroad unto
    all men” (Rom. 16:19).

\




# 287. Obedience

1.  OBEDIENCE is the **recognition** of the claims of God (Acts 5:29).
2.  The **mark** of conversion to the authority of Christ (Rom. 6:16).
3.  The **evidence** of our relationship to God the Father as His
    children (1 Peter 1:14).
4.  The **characteristic** of faith, for faith always responds to the
    Word of God (Heb. 11:8).
5.  The **proof** of our love to Christ (John 14:15, R.V.)
6.  The **condition** of receiving the Spirit’s power (Acts 5:32).
7.  The **indicator** of the Spirit’s working (Phil. 2:12-13).

# 288. “Once”

ONE of the key-words of Hebrews 9 and 10 is the term “once,” which
occurs seven times.

1.  **The once of limitation** (Heb. 9:7). The High Priest could only
    enter the Holiest of all, one day in the year, though he went in
    several times on that one day.
2.  **The once of completion** (Heb. 9:12). The Revised Version says
    that Christ has entered into the Holiest “*once for all*,” therefore
    His atoning work is complete. Mark also the contrast-Christ entered
    in with His own blood.
3.  **The once of manifestation** (Heb. 9:26, R.V.) Christ was hidden
    behind the veil of His Godhead before His incarnation, but He is God
    manifest in the flesh. Ponder the purpose of His appearing; it was
    to “put away sin,” which sin kept man from God, and God from man.
4.  **The once of condemnation** (Heb. 9:27). Death on account of sin,
    and judgment for sin, are the common heritage “laid up” (R.V.,
    margin), for the natural man.
5.  **The once of substitution** (Heb. 9:28). Those that believe in
    Christ, and know Him personally as their Saviour and Lord, are not
    looking for death or judgment, but for His second coming, because
    Christ has stood in their place and borne the judgment for them.
    Mark the “*as*” and “*so*” of Heb. 9:27-28.
6.  **The once of purification** (Heb. 10:2). The sacrifices under the
    Levitical economy were only effectual in atoning for the sins of the
    past year, and even then could not give a cleansed conscience; but
    Christ has, once and for ever, dealt with the question of sin in its
    penal aspect. Hence the believer is no longer a condemned criminal
    at the bar of justice, but a child in the family of God, with a
    perfect conscience, because freed from guilt by the blood of Christ.
7.  **The once of sanctification** (Heb. 10:10). The blood of Christ,
    which is the purchase price of our salvation, is also the means of
    our separation to God. As those who are sanctified in Christ to God,
    which is our privilege, we are responsible to be separate in heart
    and life to the Lord in all things. We do not seek to be saintly to
    become saints, but as saints we are to do those things that are
    consistent with our calling (1 Cor. 1:2-the words “*to be*” are in
    italics; Eph. 5:3).

# 289. Oneness of Believers

**Believers are members of Christ’s body, hence members one of
another.** As illustrating this, we will take the word “*together*” as
showing our oneness with Christ and one another.

1.  **Oneness in death.** “Planted *together* in the likeness of His
    death” (Romans 6:5).
2.  **Oneness in resurrection.** “Quickened…and raised up *together*”
    (Eph. 2:5-6).
3.  **Oneness in position.** “Made us sit *together* in heavenly places”
    (Eph. 2:6).
4.  **Oneness in suffering and glory.** “If we suffer with
    Him . . . . glorified *together*” (Rom. 8:17).
5.  **Oneness by possession.** “Builded *together*.….habitation of God”
    (Eph. 2:22). Not only purchased and pardoned, but possessed by the
    Holy Spirit, who will fill us, as God of old filled the tabernacle
    and Temple with His presence.
6.  **Oneness in fitness.** “Fitly framed *together*” (Eph. 2:21). As
    the coverings of the tabernacle were coupled together, as the stones
    in Solomon’s Temple (each one was put in its own place), so each
    believer is first made fit, then fitly framed, then fitly framed
    together-thus fit to live and serve in the place he occupies.
7.  **Oneness in place at the coming of Christ.** “Live *together*” (1
    Thess. 5:10); “heirs *together*” (1 Peter 3:7); caught up *together*
    to meet Christ in the air (1 Thess. 4:17). Different positions in
    glory, but all with Him.
8.  **Oneness in fellowship.** We read of the disciples who were on the
    way to Emmaus, that they “*talked together*;” and “how can two walk
    *together* except they are agreed?” These two were talking of the
    Lord, and He of whom they were conversing drew near and spoke to
    them; the secret of true fellowship one with another is communion
    with the Lord Himself.
9.  **Oneness in sympathy.** “Comfort yourselves *together*” (1
    Thessalonians 5:11).
10. **Oneness in prayer.** “Peter and John went up *together* into the
    Temple at the hour of prayer” (Acts 3:1). The secret of Judah’s
    victory over Ammon and Moab was, “that they gathered themselves
    *together*” to ask help of the Lord (2 Chron. 20:4).
11. **Oneness in work.** Sower and reaper working and receiving the joy
    of service now, and at the great harvest *together* (John 4:36).
12. **Oneness in worship.** “They sang *together* by course in praising
    and giving thanks unto the Lord” (Ezra 3:11).
13. **Oneness in thought.** “Perfectly joined *together* in the same
    mind” (1 Cor. 1:10).
14. **Oneness in conflict.** “Children of Israel went out…gathered
    *together* as one man” (Judges 20:1).
15. **Oneness in love.** “Knit *together* in love” (Col. 2:2).
16. **Oneness in labour.** “Striving *together* for the faith of the
    Gospel” (Phil. 1:27). In all the above Scriptures we see the union
    there is from God’s standpoint amongst all those who are His; and if
    we would have manifest unity among the Church of God, there must
    be-and it will only come in this way-the recognition of our oneness
    in Christ, hence our oneness one with the other.

Christians, remember there are many children in the family. They may
call themselves by different names, but there is only one family-one
Father; many members in the body, but only one body-one Head; many
stones in the building, but only one house-one Foundation; many branches
in the Vine, but only one Vine; many sheep in the flock, but only one
flock-one Shepherd; many priests, but only one order-one High Priest;
many crumbs, but only one Loaf; many citizens, but only one city.
# 290. “Only”

THE first commandment is God’s claim to have the *absolute* place in the
heart and life (Ex. 20:3). Jehovah will not share with another. Christ
repeats this same truth when Satan would have Him to worship himself
(Matt. 4:10). The following Scriptures where the word “only” occurs will
illustrate the absoluteness of God’s claim:

1.  **Saved** by the Lord only (2 Kings 19:19; Isaiah 37:20).
2.  **Separated** only unto the Lord (1 Sam. 7:3-4).
3.  **Sacrificing** only to the Lord (Ex. 22:20).
4.  **Serving** only the Lord (Matt. 4:10).
5.  **Speaking** only the word of the Lord (Numbers 22:35).
6.  **Seeing** only the Lord (Matt. 17:8).
7.  **Singing** only of the Lord (Romans 16:27).

# 291. Open Things

THE open tomb of Jesus (Mark 16:4) proclaims-

1.  An opened **Fountain** for sin (Zech. 13:1).
2.  An opened **Heaven** for blessing (Mark 1:10).
3.  An opened **heart** for Christ (Acts 16:14).
4.  An opened **understanding** for Christ (Luke 24:45).
5.  An opened **Bible** for comfort (Luke 24:32).
6.  An opened **mouth** for testimony (Eph. 6:19).
7.  An open **face** for privilege (2 Cor 3:18).
8.  An open **door** for revelation (Rev. 3:8).

\




# 292. Oughtness of the Christian Life

ALL God’s children feel there are many things we ought to do, but we do
not always rise to the occasion.

1.  **The oughtness of Prayer.** “Men *ought* always to pray” (Luke
    18:1).
2.  **The oughtness of Ministry.** “*Ought* to wash one another’s feet”
    (John 13:14).
3.  **The oughtness of Obedience.** “*Ought* to obey God” (Acts 5:29).
4.  **The oughtness of God-pleasing.** “ *Ought* to walk and to please
    God” (1 Thess. 4:1).
5.  **The oughtness of Walking.** “*Ought* himself also to walk, even as
    He walked” (1 John 2:6).
6.  **The oughtness of Love.** “We *ought* also to love one another” (1
    John 4:11).
7.  **The oughtness of Obligation.** “We *ought* to lay down our lives
    for the brethren” (1 John 3:16).

\




# 293. Our God

1.  THE God of **Truth** to sanctify. “A God of truth and without
    iniquity” (Deut. 32:4).
2.  God of all **Grace** to establish. “But the God of all grace…make
    you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you” (1 Peter 5:10).
3.  The God of **Peace** to calm. “The God of peace shall be with you”
    (Phil. 4:9).
4.  The God of **Love** to enrich. “Be perfect, be of good comfort, be
    of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be
    with you” (2 Cor. 13:11).
5.  The God of all **Comfort** to console. “The God of all comfort, who
    comforteth us in all our tribulations” (2 Cor. 1:3-4).
6.  The God of **Patience** to enable. “Now the God of patience and
    consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another,
    according to Christ Jesus” (Rom. 15:5).
7.  The God of **Hope** to cheer. “Now the God of hope fill you with all
    joy and peace in believing” (Rom. 15:13).
8.  The God of **Glory** to attract. “The God of glory appeared unto our
    father Abraham” (Acts 7:2).
9.  The God of **Judgment** to search. “The Lord is a God of judgment”
    (Isa. 30:18).
10. The Father of **Mercies** to bless. “Blessed be God.…the Father of
    mercies” (2 Cor. 1:3).

     **Now walking in the truth, as the elect lady and her children.**
    “Walking in truth” (2 John 4).
3.  **Once walking after the world, as Demas.** “Demas hath forsaken me,
    having loved this present evil world” (2 Tim. 4:10).\
     **Now walking after the world to come, as Abram.** “He looked for a
    city…whose builder and maker is God” (Heb. 11:10).

# 297. Wisdom's Start and Separation

PROVERBS 1:1-15

PROVERBS 1: brings out in vivid contrast the wisdom of the wise and the
folly of the foolish. The one is under the power of God, and therefore
has His authority, and the other is under the will of self, and in
consequence ends his career in dismay and destruction.

1.  **Wisdom’s start.** “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
    knowledge” (Proverbs 1:7). Gladstone said some time since, “The
    older I grow the more confirmed I am in my faith and religion. I
    have been in public life fifty-eight years, and forty-seven in the
    Cabinet of the British Government, and during these forty-seven
    years I have been associated with sixty of the master minds of the
    country, and all but five of the sixty were Christians.” The above
    gives colouring to the statement that the men were what they were
    because they were Christians.\
     What a difference there is between the fear of the Lord and the
    fear of man. The latter brings “a snare” (Proverbs 29:25), while the
    former is:—\
    Departing from evil (Proverbs 3:7).
    Hating all evil (Proverbs 8:13).
    Prolonging of days (Proverbs 10:27).
    Inspirer of confidence (Proverbs 14:26).
    Fountain of life (Proverbs 14:27).
    Minister of contentment (Proverbs 15:16).
    Instructor of wisdom (Proverbs 15:33).
    Satisfier of soul (Proverbs 19:23).
    Harbinger of true riches (Proverbs 22:4).
    Keeper of the heart (Proverbs 23:17).
    Steadier of the soul (Proverbs 24:21).
2.  **Wisdom’s separation.** The three “*nots*” are pointed in their
    bearing and practical in their application. They are “Forsake thou
    not” (Proverbs 1:8), “Consent not” (Proverbs 1:10), and “Walk not”
    (Proverbs 1:15).\
     “*Forsake thou not*.” The law of the mother which the son is
    exhorted not to forsake, is the law of God which the mother had made
    hers by her faith and obedience, just as Paul speaks of the Gospel
    of God as “My Gospel” (2 Tim. 2:8). Sherman says, “‘Wanted-a boy who
    obeys his mother.’ So advertised one employer. Thousands of such
    boys are wanted. I never yet knew a lad prosper in the world who did
    not love his mother.” The mother’s apron strings, if fastened on by
    the Lord, are cables to keep the soul steady on the sea of life.\
     “*Consent not*” (Proverbs 1:10). “This is the defence, a blunt,
    peremptory ‘No.’ The method of defence must be different from the
    enemy’s mode of attack. His strength lies in making gradual
    approaches; ours in a resistance, sudden, resolute, total.” As a
    good man said of temptation, “I cannot help an ill bird flying over
    my head, but I can prevent him from making a nest in my hair.”
    Whoever hesitates and argues when a known sin is presented before
    him, is already half lost.\
     “*Walk not*” (Proverbs 1:15). Separation from sin and sinners is
    the Christian’s safety. If we walk with the ungodly we shall be
    contaminated by them, even as a canary if put with a sparrow, will
    begin to chirrup like it. Abraham (Gen. 12:10), Lot (Gen. 19:17),
    Jehoshaphat (2 Chron. 18:1), Peter (Luke 22:55), got into bondage of
    spirit, bitterness of soul, and lost the blessing of the Lord’s
    approval, through fellowship of the ungodly.

# 298. Paul's Experience

ACTS 26:5-26

1.  **Conversion of Paul.** The Apostle tells Agrippa what he *was* when
    in his natural state; namely, a self-righteous Pharisee (Acts 26:5),
    an opponent to Jesus (Acts 26:9), a persecutor of the saints (Acts
    26:10), a misguided man in obeying the priests (Acts 26:10), an
    inflicter of punishment upon God’s people (Acts 26:11), an
    instrument in the hands of Satan in causing some of the disciples of
    Christ to blaspheme (Acts 26:11), and a fanatic, in that he was
    “exceedingly mad” in his unholy service (Acts 26:11); but a vision
    of Christ in His holiness caused him to see his sinfulness. It was
    Paul’s *obedience* to the heavenly vision that was the pivot upon
    which the persecutor became the pleader with God and men (Acts
    26:19).
2.  **Commission of Paul.** Being *saved* through Christ he was next
    *sent* by Christ to preach the Gospel. We are saved to serve, we do
    not serve to be saved. Paul was sent to accomplish a fivefold
    purpose in the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 26:18).
    -   **Revelation.** “Open their eyes.”
    -   **Repentance.** “Turn from darkness to light.”
    -   **Release.** “From the power of Satan unto God.”
    -   **Remission.** “Receive forgiveness of sins.”
    -   **Riches.** “Inheritance.”

    All these blessings are bestowed upon those who have faith in
    Christ.
3.  **Consecration of Paul.** “I was not disobedient,” &c. (Acts 26:19).
    Obedience is the law of the Kingdom of Grace.
4.  **Continuance of Paul** (Acts 26:22). The Apostle tells us the
    secret of his continuance: it was because he obtained (not attained)
    help from God. *Obtainment* is the secret of *attainment*. Mark that
    the Apostle obtained help for a specific object, viz., that he might
    witness to and of the things in the Scriptures.
5.  **Creed of Paul** (Acts 26:23). He believed in the sufferings of
    Christ for the sins of man, and in the resurrection of Christ for
    the justification of the believer (Rom. 4:25).
6.  **Calmness of Paul** (Acts 26:25). Festus thinks that Paul is mad as
    he listens to the earnest and burning words which fall from his
    lips, and tells him so; but, as the Apostle says, he is perfectly
    cool and calm, and speaks forth “the words of truth and soberness.”
7.  **Courage of Paul** (Acts 26:26). The Apostle does not hesitate to
    tell King Agrippa that he knew what he was speaking about, and then
    begins to put pointed questions to him. Courage is one of the fruits
    of the filling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:31).

# 299. Peace

1.  PEACE is of **heavenly origin** as to its source. “God is not the
    author of confusion, but of peace” (1 Cor. 14:33).
2.  Peace is a **fruit of the Spirit** as to its impartation. “The fruit
    of the Spirit is…peace” (Gal. 5:22).
3.  Peace is a **product of the Cross** as to its channel. “So making
    peace.…by the Cross” (Eph. 2:15-16).
4.  Peace is a **plant of obedience** as to its condition. “If ye walk
    in My statutes, and keep My commandments, I will give peace”
    (Leviticus 26:3, 6).
5.  Peace is a **variegated plant** as to its fulness. “Peace I leave
    with you, My peace I give unto you” (John 14:27).

# 300. Peace

GRACE, mercy, and peace are the trio of Gospel blessings. Grace is love
planning to bless, mercy is love acting, and peace is love enjoyed.

 **P Purchased Peace.** 
:   There are many who talk about “making their peace with God.” This is
    an impossibility. Man can never make his peace with God; but there
    is something better, and that is, that Christ has made peace by the
    blood of His Cross. The purchase price of the peace of the Gospel is
    the blood of Christ (Col. 1:20).
 **E Embodied Peace.** 
:   “He is our Peace.” It is not merely something from Christ, but
    Christ Himself, who is the believer’s peace (Eph. 2:14). I remember
    an aged saint exclaiming to me once, “Oh, I wish I had peace!” I
    asked her, “Have you Christ?” “Oh, yes!” she replied. “Then you have
    got peace, because you have Christ, for ‘He is our Peace.’” If we
    sever blessing from Christ we shall never enjoy blessing, but if we
    see that we have every blessing in Christ (Eph. 1:3), and that
    Christ is every blessing, then we have blessing.
 **A Abiding Peace.** 
:   “My peace I give unto you” (John 14:27) is Christ’s gift to His
    people. Whatever Christ gives must be like Himself, enduring and
    unfailing, for He is “the same yesterday, today, and for ever” (Heb.
    13:8). The things of this world pass away (1 John 2:17), but the
    things of the world to come are like the words of Christ (Matt.
    24:35), they never pass away.
 **C Complete Peace.** 
:   The peace of God is perfect in its nature and perfect in its keeping
    (Isa. 26:3). Like a circle, it is complete in its character, and
    encircling in its embrace. To be complete in Christ (Col. 2:10) is
    to have a complete peace, because we are in a complete Saviour.
 **E Ennobling Peace.** 
:   When the Lord Jesus has said peace to the sin-sick soul (Luke 7:50),
    and when the peace of God rules in the heart (Col. 3:15), through
    being anxious for nothing, prayerful in everything, and thankful for
    anything (Phil. 4:6-7), then in the quietness and calmness which are
    begotten by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:13) the life shall be calm as a
    river (Isa. 66:12), and the peace of God shall play upon the face
    (Acts 6:15).

# 301. Peace in Isaiah

1.  **Prince of Peace.** “And His Name shall be called . . . . the
    Prince of Peace” (Isa. 9:6).
2.  **Perpetuity of Peace.** “Of the increase of His government and
    peace, there shall be no end” (Isa. 9:7).
3.  **Perfection of Peace.** “Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace”
    (Isa. 26:3).
4.  **Power of Peace.** “Lord, Thou wilt ordain peace for us” (Isa.
    26:12).
5.  **Possessor of Peace.** “And He shall make peace with Me” (Isa.
    27:5).
6.  **Parent of Peace.** “And the work of righteousness shall be peace”
    (Isa. 32:17).
7.  **Promise of Peace.** “He said.…there shall be peace and truth in my
    days” (Isa. 39:8).
8.  **Protection of Peace.** “He pursued them and passed in peace” (Isa.
    41:3, M.)
9.  **Provider of Peace.** “I make peace” (Isa. 45:7).
10. **Partner of Peace.** “Then had thy peace been as a river” (Isa.
    48:18).
11. **Publisher of Peace.** “That publisheth peace” (Isa. 52:7).
12. **Permanence of Peace.** “Neither shall the covenant of My peace be
    removed” (Isa. 54:10).
13. **Price of Peace.** “The chastisement of our peace was upon Him”
    (Isa. 53:5).
14. **Preciousness of Peace.** “Great shall be the peace of thy
    children” (Isa. 54:13).
15. **Progress of Peace.** “And be led forth with peace” (Isa. 55:12).
16. **Prospect of Peace.** “He shall enter into peace” (Isa. 57:2).
17. **Proclamation of Peace.** “Peace, peace to him that is far off”
    (Isa. 57:19).
18. **Picture of Peace.** “I will extend peace to her like a river”
    (Isa. 66:12).

# 302. People of God

BALAAM’S words about God’s people (Numbers 24:5-9, 17-19; Deut. 33:29),
illustrate what God does for them.

1.  **God’s people are a goodly people** (Num. 24:5). Goodly because
    partakers of the goodness of God. The valleys, with their
    fruitfulness and flowers, are an illustration of the goodly fruits
    and fragrance that are produced in the lives of those who are
    possessed by, and are under the power of Him.
2.  **God’s people are a supplied people** (Num. 24:7). Water poured out
    of buckets is but a simile of His continual supply and His
    all-sufficient grace to meet our every need.
3.  **God’s people are an exalted people.** “His people shall be higher
    than Agag” (Num. 24:7). Our King is Christ; He is exalted to the
    right hand of God (Phil. 2:9), and we are exalted with Him
    (Ephesians 2:6).
4.  **God’s people are a delivered people.** We are delivered from the
    wrath to come (1 Thess. 1:10); from the second death (2 Cor. 1:10);
    from our enemies (Luke 1:74); and from this present evil world
    (Galatians 1:4).
5.  **God’s people are an honoured people** (Num. 24:17-19). Israel was
    honoured because Christ came from them, and was of them.
6.  **God’s people are a happy people** (Deut. 33:29). Happy because
    their sins are forgiven (Psalm 32:1, 2); because chosen by Him
    (Psalm 33:12); because trusting in Him (Psalm 34:8). because
    occupied with Him (Psalm 40:4); because ministering to others for
    Him (Psalm 41:1); because abiding in Him (Psalm 65:4; 84:4); because
    strengthened by Him (Psalm 84:5). The word “blessed” in the Psalms
    is the same word that is rendered “happy” in Deuteronomy 33:29.
7.  **God’s people are a saved people.** Saved by the death of Christ as
    to the means of salvation (John 10:9-11); saved by the Holy Spirit
    as to the effectual cause of salvation (Titus 3:5); saved by faith
    as to the reception ot salvation (Luke 7:50); saved by the Gospel as
    to the knowledge of salvation (1 Cor. 15:2); saved by the risen
    living Christ as to being kept from sinning (Rom. 5:10); and saved
    by hope as to the completeness of our salvation (Rom. 8:24).

# 303. Personality of the Holy Spirit

The Personal **Companion** to cheer. “*He* dwelleth with you” (John
14:17).

The Personal **Servant** listening. “*He* shall not speak from Himself”
(John 16:13, R.V.).
The Personal **Hearer** speaking. “*He* shall hear” (John 16:13).
The Personal **Speaker** declaring. “That shall *He* speak” (John
16:13).
The Personal **Revealer** unfolding. “*He* will show” (John 16:13).
The Personal **Work** accomplished. “*He* shall glorify Me” (John
16:14).
The Personal **Receiver** making known. “*He* shall receive of Mine”
(John 16:14).
# 304. Places of Blessing

1.  **On His shoulders.** The place of strength. “He layeth it on His
    shoulders” (Luke 15:5).
2.  **On His bosom.** The place of confidence. “He then lying on Jesus’
    breast, saith unto Him, Lord, who is it?” (John 13:25).
3.  **On His heart.** The place of affection. “And they shall be upon
    Aaron’s heart” (Ex. 28:15-30).
4.  **On His hands.** The place of remembrance. “I have graven thee upon
    the palms of My hands” (Isaiah 49:16).
5.  **On His forehead.** The place of thought. “And it shall be upon
    Aaron’s forehead” (Ex. 28:38).
6.  **On His wings.** The place of power. “They shall mount up with
    wings as eagles” (Isaiah 40:31).
7.  **In His arms.** The place of support. “Underneath are the
    everlasting arms” (Deut. 33:27).
8.  **At His feet.** The place of blessing. “Mary, which also sat at
    Jesus’ feet, and heard His word” (Luke 10:39).
9.  **In His hand.** The place of use. “I the Lord thy God will hold thy
    right hand saying unto thee, fear not . . thou shalt thresh the
    mountains” (Isa. 41:13-15).

\




# 305. Pleasing the Lord

THERE are several ways by which we, as believers in Christ, may please
the Lord.

right hand of God-

1.  As our **Intercessor** to plead for us (Romans 8:34).
2.  As the **Honoured One** for us (Mark 16:19).
3.  As the **Channel** of blessing to us (Acts 2:33).
4.  As the **Waiting One** to receive us (Acts 7:56).
5.  As **Head** of the body, to minister to us (Eph. 1:20-22).
6.  As the **Object** to attract us (Col. 3:1).
7.  As the **Sin-purger** who has cleared us (Heb. 1:3).
8.  As the **Glorified One** who is to reign (Heb. 1:13).
9.  As our **Representative** (Heb. 8:1).

11. As the **Conqueror** over His foes (Heb. 12:2).
12. As the **Almighty One** (1 Peter 3:22).
13. As the **Expecting One** (Psalm 110:1).

\




# 307. Power

“GIVE me a fulcrum and a lever and I will move the world,” said one.
Christ is the Lever of Power, and a believing (obedient) heart is the
fulcrum.

1.  The **power of Christ’s Resurrection** will raise us above an
    earthly and selfish life (Phil. 3:10).
2.  The **power of Christ’s Grace** will enable us to glory in infirmity
    (2 Cor. 12:9).
3.  The **power of Christ’s Spirit** will make Him a reality in our
    experience (Eph. 3:16).
4.  The **power of His Keeping** will preserve us to the heavenly
    inheritance (1 Peter 1:4-5).
5.  The **power of His Love** will give us to enjoy the “all things”
    that pertain to life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3).
6.  The **power of Christ’s Ministry** will operate through us as we
    allow Him (Acts 1:8; 3:12; 4:33).
7.  The **power of His Favour** will urge us to be faithful to Him (2
    Tim. 2:1).

# 308. Power

1.  **Spirit sanctifying** power as seen in Stephen. “And Stephen, full
    of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people”
    (Acts 6:8).
2.  **Doing good** power, as illustrated in Christ. “Who went about
    doing good” (Acts 10:38).
3.  **Bodily healing** power, as demonstrated in the healing of the lame
    man. “As though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to
    walk” (Acts 3:12).
4.  **Grace begetting** power. “That ye may abound in hope, through the
    power of the Holy Ghost” (Rom. 15:13).
5.  **Christ endearing** power. “To be strengthened with might hy His
    Spirit in the inner man” (Eph. 3:16).
6.  **Service enabling** power. “Wherefore I also labour, striving
    according to His working, which worketh in me mightily (Col. 1:29).
7.  **Glorifying in infirmity** power, as made known in Paul. “Most
    gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the

    to His glorious power, unto all patience” (Col. 1:11).
9.  **Soul keeping** power. “Who are kept by the power of God through
    faith unto salvation” (1 Peter 1:5).

\




# 309. Power of Darkness

DARKNESS represents that which is evil, hence men love darkness, &c.
There is the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of misery, and the
darkness of sin.

1.  **Subtle power.** “Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast”
    (Gen. 3:1).
2.  **Blighting power.** “Behold all that he hath is in thy power” (Job
    1:12). “Satan smote Job with sore boils” (Job 2:7).
3.  **Accusing power.** “Doth Job fear God for nought?” (Job 1:9).
4.  **Resisting power.** “Satan standing at his right hand to resist
    him” (Zechariah 3:1).
5.  **Constraining power.** “Satan provoked David to number Israel” (1
    Chron. 21:1).
6.  **Opposing power.** “Get thee behind Me, Satan” (Mark 8:33).
7.  **Binding power.** “Satan hath bound these eighteen years” (Luke
    13:16).
8.  **Sifting power.** “Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
    you as wheat” (Luke 22:31).
9.  **Robbing power.** “Then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word
    out of their hearts” (Luke 8:12).
10. **Lying power.** “Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
    Holy Ghost?” (Acts 5:3).
11. **Hindering power.** “We would have come….Satan hindered us” (1
    Thess. 2:18).
12. **Persecuting power.** “The messenger of Satan to buffet me” (2 Cor.
    12:7).
13. **Destructive power.** “Then entered Satan into Judas” (Luke 22:3).

# 310. Practical Power of Christ's Resurrection

1.  THE resurrection of Jesus in its practical power is associated with
    our blessing (Acts 3:26).
2.  Our conduct towards others (Rom. 14:9-10).
3.  Our object in life (2 Cor. 5:15).
4.  Our walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4).
5.  Our stay in service (2 Tim. 2:8).
6.  Our fruit-bearing (Rom. 7:4).
7.  Our power for every emergency (Eph. 1:19-20).

# 311. Prayer

“THEY TELL HIM OF HER” (Mark 1:30).

“THEY tell Him of her.” How simple and yet how striking the words! In
them are found the essential and essence of prayer. Emphasize each word.

“*They* tell Him of her.” The men who are in touch with Christ have the
ear of Christ. Holy John, zealous Peter, discriminating James, and
faithful Andrew, are the men who are in touch with Christ. These men in
their several characteristics may be taken as illustrating four
essentials in prayer, namely, holiness, zeal, discrimination and
faithfulness.

1.  **Holiness** of heart and life are the **foundation of prayer.** It
    is no use lifting up our hands if they are not holy (1 Tim. 2:8);
    nor must we approach the golden altar of incense to offer praise
    before we have washed away the filthiness of flesh and spirit at the
    laver of God’s truth by confession (2 Cor. 7:1).
2.  **Fervency** of spirit is the **prevailer in prayer.** It was the
    importunate widow who got her plea granted (Luke 18:5); it was the
    persistent friend who got his need supplied (Luke 11:8); and it was
    the incessant knocking of Peter which caused the inmates to let him
    into the house (Acts 12:16).
3.  **Discrimination** is the **wisdom of prayer.** There are some
    things for which God’s people ask, that they have already got in
    Christ; others are praying when they should be acting, asking God to
    do things which they can do themselves; and others are praying in a
    wrong spirit. To discriminate in prayer is to observe the conditions
    for prevailing in prayer.
4.  **Faithfulness** is the **backbone of prayer.** Faithfulness may be
    read two ways. First, consistency or fidelity to the Word of God in
    whole-hearted obedience; and second, fulness of faith, that is, an
    unhesitating and unceasing confidence and trust in God.

“They *tell* Him of her.” What is prayer? It is illustrated here.
Speaking to Christ is prayer. Prayer is not getting on to the stilts of
wordism, nor floating in the balloon of honeyed phrases by the aid of
the gas of human eloquence, inflating the mind with self-conceit; but it
is simply telling the Lord the heart’s need, or speaking to Him in a
natural manner as we ask favours for others.

Telling Him the *trouble*, as the disciples of John, when they went and
informed Christ that their teacher was beheaded (Matt. 14:12).

Telling Him the *sorrow*, as when Mary went to Christ about her dead
brother Lazarus (John 11:32).

Telling Him the *pain*, as when Paul prayed about the thorn in the flesh
(2 Cor. 12:8).

Telling Him the *grief*, as when the Syrophenician woman cried to Christ
about her daughter (Matt. 15:22).

Telling Him the *joy*, as when the disciples spoke of the demons they
had cast out in His name (Luke 10:17).

Telling Him the *difficulty*, as when the disciples asked to be taught
how to pray (Luke 11:1).

Telling Him the *sickness*, as in the present case.

“They tell *Him* of her.” There is no need to mention *His* name, we
have only to put a capital H to the pronoun for it to be recognised that
we speak of Christ. He has made it possible for us to tell Him, for He
has died for us; hence we can come boldly to the throne of grace through
the consecrated way of His atonement, and speak to Him face to face. He
has told us to come to Him, for He has said “Whatsoever we shall ask in
prayer, believing, we shall receive.” His promise is our plea and
introduction in speaking to Him. We remember who He is, and as we do so
we are drawn towards Him, as the needle is drawn to the loadstone.

He is the *Shepherd* who tends us, and ever looks after our interests.

He is the *Priest* who represents us, and succours us in the hour of
temptation.

He is the *Friend* who thinks of us, and always sympathises with us.

He is the *Brother* who cares for us, and is ever ready to aid us.

He is the *Saviour* who delivered us, and will always keep us.

He is the *God* who has blessed us, and will never leave us.

He is the *Lover* who loves us, and will never be unfaithful.

Tell Him, for He *cares*. Tell Him, for He *knows*. Tell Him, for He
*loves*. Tell Him, for He is *listening*. Tell Him *all*. Tell Him
*often*. Tell Him *always*. Tell Him *now*.

“They tell Him *of her*.” They were very definite in their petition and
pointed in their plea. They did not vacillate or hesitate, but they went
right to the mark and hit it. And methinks as they saw the once fevered
patient calm and cool, as she waited upon them, they rejoiced; and if
they had wanted a new name for Simon’s wife’s mother, they might have
called her Answered-Prayer.

\




# 312. Prayer of Faith

1.  **Confession** of sin. “To seek by prayer and supplications” (Daniel
    9:3-20).
2.  **Cleansing** from sin. “Thy sin purged” (Isaiah 6:7).
3.  **Consecration** to the Saviour. “Behold, he prayeth” (Acts
    9:11-20).
4.  **Confidence** in the Saviour. “Said unto the Lord, increase our
    faith” (Luke 17:5).
5.  **Courage** from the Saviour. “They lifted up their voice to God
    with one accord” (Acts 4:24-33).
6.  **Calmness** in the Saviour. “The peace of God….shall keep your
    hearts and minds” (Phil. 4:6-7).
7.  **Communion** with the Saviour. “Did not our heart burn…while He
    talked with us” (Luke 24:32).

# 313. Preparation

REHOBOAM is condemned because he did not prepare “his heart to seek the
Lord” (2 Chron. 12:14), while Jehoshaphat is commended for seeking Him
(2 Chron. 19:3). If we would bring upon us a like commendation, then let
us carry out the following points in the acrostic on preparation.

**P** Praying in the name of Jesus (John 14:14).

**R** Regarding the merit of Jesus (Heb. 10:19).

**E** Expecting an answer for the sake of Jesus (John 15:16).

**P** Purity of heart (Psalm 66:18).

**A** Abiding in Christ (John 15:7).

**R** Righteousness of life (1 Tim. 2:8).

**A** Asking according to God’s will (1 John 5:14).

**T** Trusting wholly in the Lord (Heb. 11:6).

** I** Importunity, “Ask-Seek-Knock” (Matt. 7:7).

**O** Obeying the word of the Lord (John 15:7).

**N** Nothing in our hearts condemning us (1 John 3:21-22).
# 314. Presence of Christ

THE presence of Christ is **protection**, as the three Hebrew young men
found (Daniel 3:25, 27).

The presence of Christ is **preservation**, as Peter experienced
(Matthew 14:30-31).

The presence of Christ is **power**, as Paul knew (2 Cor. 12:9).

The presence of Christ is **peace**, as the disciples were made to know
(John 20:21, 26).

The presence of Christ is **progress**, as we see from John 10:27, for
the sheep follow Him.

The presence of Christ is **paradise**, as John found in the Isle of
Patmos (Rev. 1:13-18).

The presence of Christ is **provision**, as we see in His feeding the
multitude (John 6:11).
# 315. Presence of God with David

“THE Lord was with David” (1 Sam. 18:12, 14, 28). All that David had
achieved, and all that He was, were due to the presence of the Lord. The
secret of David’s greatness (2 Sam. 5:10), the cause of his victories (2
Sam. 22:30), the source of his overcoming Goliath (1 Sam. 17:45), the
reason of his wise behaviour (1 Sam. 18:14), and the strength of his
comfort (Psalm 23:4), were all found in the Lord’s presence with him. To
recognise God’s presence with us means:—

1.  **Rest** in walk (Ex. 33:14).
2.  **Refreshment** in trial (Heb. 13:5-6).
3.  **Rejoicing** in trouble (Acts 27:23).
4.  **Renewal** in weakness (Isaiah 40:31).
5.  **Resource** in service (Matt. 28:20).
6.  **Reflection** in life (2 Cor. 3:18).
7.  **Reward** in persecution (2 Tim. 4:17).

# 316. Presence of the Lord

The presence of the Lord to His people means:—

1.  **Light in trouble.** “Lord, lift Thou up the *light* of Thy
    *countenance* upon us” (Psalm 4:6).
2.  **Joy in sorrow.** “1 Thy *presence* is fulness of *joy*” (Psalm
    16:11).
3.  **Hiding in persecution.** “Thou shalt *hide* them in the secret of
    Thy *presence*” (Psalm 31:20).
4.  **Help in discouragement.** “I shall yet praise Him for the *help*
    of His *countenance*” (Psalm 42:5).
5.  **Health in disquietude.** “Who is the *health* of my *countenance*
    and my God” (Psalm 42:11).
6.  **Encouragement in life.** “His *countenance* doth behold the
    upright” (Psalm 11:7).
7.  **Gladness in responsibility.** “Thou hast made him exceeding *glad*
    with Thy *countenance*” (Psalm 21:6).

\




# 317. Preservation

“THOU SHALT PRESERVE” (Psalm 32:7).

JEHOVAH will preserve His people:—

1.  **Securely,** as a strong city. “We have a strong city” (Is. 26:1).
2.  **Continually,** as a watchman. “The Lord shall preserve thy going
    out” (Psalm 121:8).
3.  **Immediately,** as the eye-lid does the eye. “He kept him as the
    apple of His eye” (Deut. 32:10; Psalm 17:8).
4.  **Calmly,** as the strong man keeps the weaker one. “Thou (Jehovah)
    wilt keep him” &c. (Isaiah 26:3-6).
5.  **Carefully,** as the gardener keeps the garden. “I, the Lord, do
    keep it; I will water it every moment” (Isaiah 27:3).
6.  **Affectionately,** as the parent keeps the child. “I will hold
    thine hand, and will keep thee” (Isaiah 42:6).
7.  **Powerfully,** as a garrison keeps the camp. “Kept by the power of
    God” (1 Peter 1:5).



# 318. Prevailing Prayer

GENESIS xxxii

1.  **Prevailing prayer pleads the promises** (Gen. 32:9). Trapp
    says:—”Promises must be prayed over. God loves to be burdened with,
    and to be importuned in His own words; to be sued upon His own bond.
    Prayer is putting the promises into suit. Such prayers will be nigh
    the Lord day and night (1 Kings 8:59). He can as little deny them as
    deny Himself.”
2.  **Prevailing prayer confesses its unworthiness** (Gen. 32:10). We do
    not receive blessing because of our confession, but we are not blest
    without it.
3.  **Prevailing prayer asks definitely** (Gen. 32:11). Jacob knew what
    he wanted, and prayed accordingly. He had offended and robbed his
    brother, and now he seeks deliverance from his righteous anger. The
    Lord often over-rules our blunders to our benefit and His own glory.
    Jacob not only prays for himself, but also for those who are near
    and dear to him.
4.  **Prevailing prayer is to be alone with God** (Gen. 32:24). The
    words of Christ are “Pray in secret” (Matt. 6:6). Christ is our
    Example in this, for He went to the mountain to pray (Matt. 14:23).
    Praying in secret we shall get revelations of His glory, as Daniel
    did at the riverside (Dan. 8:16); we shall have the consciousness of
    the presence of Christ, as John had on the Isle of Patmos (Rev. 1);
    we shall be commissioned, as Peter was, when he was on the housetop
    at Joppa (Acts 10:9); we shall meet the Rebekahs of blessing, as
    Isaac did, when meditating in the field (Gen. 24:63); and we shall
    receive blessing, as Jacob 999:
5.  **Prevailing prayer is intensely earnest.** Trapp well remarks, in
    speaking of the angel wrestling with Jacob: “There wrestled a man
    with him; in a proper combat, by might and sleight; to the raising
    of dust and causing of sweat, as the word importeth. This strife was
    not only corporeal, but spiritual; as well as by the force of his
    faith, as strength of body. ’He prevaileth,’ saith the prophet
    (Hosea 12:4), by prayers and tears. Our Saviour also prayed Himself
    into ‘an agony’ (Luke 22:44); and we are bidden to ’strive in
    prayer’ (Rom. 15:30); Nehemiah prayed himself pale (Neh. 2:2);
    Daniel prayed himself ‘sick’ (Dan. 8:27). Hannah prayed, striving
    with such an unusual motion of her lips, that old Eli, looking upon
    her, thought her drunk (1 Sam. 1:13). Elijah puts his head betwixt
    his knees, as straining every spring of heart in prayer (1 Kings
    18:42). Every sound is not music, so neither is every uttering of
    petitions to God a prayer. It is not the labour of the lips, but the
    travail of the heart. Common beggary is the easiest and poorest
    trade; but this beggary, as it is the richest so it is the hardest.”
6.  **Prevailing prayer is seen in a clinging faith** (Gen. 32:26).
    Jacob got no blessing while wrestling, but the wrestling led to the
    blessing. The angel touched his thigh, and then he could wrestle no
    more, but he held on the tighter, and would not let the angel go
    till he received a blessing from him. Three boys each gave a
    definition of faith, which definitions illustrate the tenacity of
    faith. The first boy said, “It was taking hold of Christ;” the
    second, “keeping hold;” and the third, “not letting go.”
7.  **Prevailing prayer is rewarded** (Gen. 32:28-30). 1. He got his
    name changed from Jacob, the supplanter, to Israel, the prince of
    God. 2. He received definite blessing from God. 3. He was a
    testimony for God ever afterwards in his halting gait.

# 319. Pride

I. KINGS 20:1-30.

IN the attitude and action of the King of Syria we have an illustration
of the course and consequence of pride (1Ki. 20:10).

1.  **The demand of pride** (1Ki. 20:1-6). Pride is always overreaching
    in its claims, selfish in its requests, and cruel in its commands.
2.  **The boast of pride** (1Ki. 20:10). Pride never uses a small i, but
    always the capital I. What a lot of “I” there was in the Pharisee’s
    prayer!
3.  **The recklessness of pride** (1Ki. 20:12). Pride ever seeks to
    “enjoy itself,” although danger may be near. Nero played his fiddle
    while Rome was burning.
4.  **The enemy of pride** (1Ki. 20:13-15). God hates pride; it is an
    abomination to Him.
5.  **The pastime of pride** (1Ki. 20:16). Ben-hadad was drinking when
    he should have been on the alert. What an illustration of those who
    are drunken with self-conceit and arrogance. “This one thing I do,”
    is their cry: “I seek to find satisfaction in what the world
    offers.”
6.  **The assumption of pride** (1Ki. 20:18). The King of Syria took it
    for granted that he would take captive those who had come out from
    Israel; so the sinner thinks his plans will be sure to succeed, till
    they are exploded; then he discovers his folly.
7.  **The overthrow of pride** (1Ki. 20:19-21). Destruction is the
    result of pride (Prov. 16:18). Pride is the forerunner of
    destruction. It was so in the case of Korah, when he in his pride
    coveted the priesthood (Numbers xvi).
8.  **The persistence of pride** (1Ki. 20:22-27). Although defeated,
    Ben-hadad returns to his former course. How like one, who, although
    he has had to smart for his action, still seeks to follow his former
    course of conduct.
9.  **The punishment of pride** (1Ki. 20:27-30). The sinner can no more
    escape the punishment that his sin deserves, than the moth can
    escape being burnt by coming in contact with the lighted candle.

# 320. Pride

EXAMPLE OF PRIDE-UZZIAH (2 Chron. 26:16-23).

As Lot’s wife was a standing testimony to the judgment of God, so is
Uzziah. The king wilfully went against the command of God in offering
incense, which the priests alone were authorised to do (Num. 18:7). Note
the steps of his pride-

1.  A **description** of pride. “His heart was lifted up” (2Chron.
    26:16).
2.  The **outcome** of pride. “Transgressed” (2Chron. 26:16).
3.  The **presumption** of pride. “Went in” &c. (2Chron. 26:16).
4.  The **anger** of pride. “Wroth” (2Chron. 26:19).
5.  The **smiting** of pride. “Smitten” (2Chron. 26:20).
6.  The **shame** of pride. “Hasted also” (2Chron. 26:20).
7.  The **separation** of pride. “Cut off” (2Chron. 26:21).
8.  The **isolation** of pride. “A leper” (2Chron. 26:23).

# 321. Priesthood of Christ

CHRIST, as our Saviour, speaks of His saving grace. Christ, as our High
Priest, tells out His sustaining grace. Christ, as our High Priest, is
seen in the Epistle to the Hebrews, as the-

1.  **Deliverer,** to assure (Heb. 2:15).
2.  **Succourer,** to sustain (Heb. 2:18).
3.  **Sympathizer,** to comfort (Heb. 4:15).
4.  **Forerunner,** to supply (Heb. 6:20).
5.  **Saviour,** to preserve (Heb. 7:25).
6.  **Watcher,** to care (Heb. 10:21).
7.  **Shepherd,** to sanctify (Heb. 13:20).

# 322. Provision of the Gospel

WHEN we call to mind the ample provision God has provided in the death
and person of His Son, we discover an ocean of grace. The following
alphabet will illustrate in some small degree the fulness of the Gospel.
In the Gospel we find—

**Acceptance** for the unworthy (Eph. 1:6).

**Blessing** for the cursed (Gal. 3:13).

**Cleansing** for the polluted (1 John 1:7).

**Deliverance** for the captive (2 Cor. 1:10).

**Enrichment** for the poor (2 Cor. 8:9).

**Fulness** of pardon for the guilty (Luke 7:42).

**Grace** for the prodigal (Luke 15:22).

**Heaven** for the hell-deserving (Col. 1:13).

**Inheritance** for the beggar (1 Peter 1:3-5).

**Joy** for the miserable (Luke 2:10).

**Kiss** of welcome for the wanderer (Luke 15:20).

**Life** for the dead (John 5:25).

**Might** for the feeble (Rom. 5:6).

**Nearness** for those who are afar off (Eph. 2:13).

**Open** door for the undeserving (John 10:9).

**Peace** for the enemy (Col. 1:20).

**Quietness** for the troubled (Luke 7:50).

**Righteousness** for the unrighteous (2 Cor. 5:21).

**Salvation** for the lost (Eph. 2:5).

**Truth** for the untrue (John 14:6).

**Union** for the severed (Rom. 11:17).

**Virtue** for the depraved (1 Cor. 6:11).

**Welcome** for all (Rev. 22:17).
# 323. "Put On"

1.  PUT Him on as **Jesus,** to save from and to the uttermost.
    “Jesus…able also to save them to the uttermost” (Heb. 7:22-25).
2.  Put Him on as **Lord,** to rule and regulate the actions. “*Put* ye
    *on* the Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 13:14).
3.  Put Him on as **Christ,** to transform the life like His. “As many
    of you as have been baptised into Christ, have *put on* Christ”
    (Galatians 3:27).
4.  Put Him on as **Holiness,** to manifest Himself. “*Put on* the new
    man……created in righteousness and true holiness” (Eph. 4:24; Col.
    3:10).
5.  Put Him on as **Armour,** to protect in all offensive and defensive
    warfare. “*Put on* the whole armour of God” (Eph. 6:11).
6.  Put Him on as **Power,** to act through in service. “Until ye be
    *endued*” (same word as “*put on*”) “with power from on high” (Luke
    24:49).
7.  Put Him on as **Light,** that He may be seen. “Let us *put on* the
    armour of Light” (Rom. 13:12).

\




# 324. Redemption

1.  **God is its Author.** “Who of God is made unto us Redemption” (1
    Cor. 1:30).
2.  **The blood of Christ is its purchase price.** “In Whom we have
    redemption through His blood” (Eph. 1:7).
3.  **Christ Himself is its Personification.** “But of Him are ye in
    Christ Jesus . . . . redemption” (1 Cor. 1:30).
4.  **The Lord Jesus is its depository.** “The redemption that is in
    Christ Jesus” (Rom. 3:24; Col. 1:14).
5.  **Deliverance is its meaning.** The word “deliverance” in Hebrews
    11:35, is the same as rendered “redemption” in other Scriptures.
6.  **Christ’s coming is its completion.** “Waiting for the adoption, to
    wit, the redemption of our body” (Rom. 8:23).
7.  **The indwelling Spirit of God is its security.** “The Spirit of
    God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption” (Eph. 4:30;
    1:14).

\




# 325. Relation of Christ to the Father

1.  **He is begotten by the Father.** “The glory as of the only Begotten
    of the Father” (John 1:14).
2.  **He dwells in the bosom of the Father.** “The only begotten Son,
    which is in the bosom of the Father” (John 1:18).
3.  **He did the will of the Father.** “I seek not Mine own will, but
    the will of the Father which hath sent Me” (John 5:30).
4.  **He lives by the Father.** “As the living Father hath sent Me, and
    I live by the Father” (John 6:57).
5.  **He did the works of the Father.** “If I do not the works of My
    Father, believe me not” (John 10:37).
6.  **He spake of the Father.** “As the Father said unto Me, so I speak”
    (John 12:50).
7.  **He glorified the Father.** “I have glorified Thee on the earth”
    (John 17:4).
8.  **He is the Way to the Father.** “No man cometh unto the Father, but
    by Me” (John 14:6).


# 326. Responsibility Regarding the Word of God

DEUTERONOMY 6:3-15

THERE are seven things Israel were to do with the statutes and commands
of Jehovah, which are indicated in the following points:—

1.  **“Observe”** (Deut. 6:3). The Hebrew word rendered “observe” means
    to hedge about, to guard, to protect. No less than twenty times in
    Deuteronomy is the same word translated “observe,” namely, Deut.
    5:32; 6:3, 25; 8:1; 11:32; 12:1, 28, 32; 15:5; 16:1, 12, 13; 17:10;
    24:8; 28:1, 13, 15, 58; 31:12; 32:46. The term is of frequent
    occurrence, and variously translated. To observe the word of the
    Lord is a comprehensive duty. This may be seen by reference to
    passages of Scripture where the Hebrew word “*Shamar*” occurs. In
    Gen. 2:15, and Psalm 17:8, the word is rendered “*keep*;” in Num.
    31:30, 47, “*kept*;” in 1 Sam. 19:2, “*take heed*;” in 1 Sam. 19:11,
    “*watch*;” in Psalm 37:37, “*mark*;” and in Josh. 24:17,
    “*preserved*.” The incidents in which the words occur afford
    illustrations as to how we are to observe the commands of Jehovah.
2.  **“In thine heart”** (Deut. 6:6). R.V., “Upon thine heart.” We
    generally speak of the head as the seat of intelligence, and the
    heart as the seat of the affections. We may grasp truth
    intelligently, and yet not lay hold of it with the heart. The wee
    fellow who said that faith was “grasping Jesus with the heart” had
    the key to the situation. If the fountain of the heart be clean, the
    stream of the life will correspond.
3.  **“Teach”** (Deut. 6:7). The margin says, “Whet or sharpen.” Dr.
    Young remarks, “The original verb generally signifies to whet or
    sharpen. I prefer deriving it from a root signifying to repeat, to
    do a thing a second time.” The Hebrew word is rendered “*whet*” in
    Deut. 32:41; “*sharp*” in Psalm 45:5; and “*pricked*” in Psalm
    73:21. From the meaning and the usage of the word it will be seen
    that no light or listless teaching is meant, but a diligent teaching
    which is as a sharp sword to cut, an arrow to stick, and an
    instrument to pierce.
4.  **“Talk”** (Deut. 6:7). The children of Israel were not to talk
    occasionally about the law of the Lord, but sitting and walking,
    however engaged, lying down and when rising up, that is, early and
    late this was to be the theme of their conversation. To talk of the
    Word of the Lord, is to have the Lord of the Word (Luke 24:32); and
    to impart that Word to others, is to have the comfort and cleansing
    of the truth, even as the pipe is cleansed which is the medium of
    conveying water to those who desire it.
5.  **“Bind”** (Deut. 6:8). The statutes of the Lord were to be bound on
    the hands of the Israelites. The law of the Lord was to be bound on
    the hand as a sign that it must be righteous in all its actions.
    Nothing mean or unrighteous was to be performed by the people of
    God, but the rule of heaven was to be knit to their being, that they
    might do the right thing always. The word translated “*bind*” is
    given “*knit*” in 1 Sam. 18:1, in speaking of Jonathan being knit to
    David in love; and “*joined together*” in stating that the wall of
    Jerusalem was completed under Nehemiah (Neh. 4:6). The command of
    love should be knit to our nature as Jonathan’s heart was bound to
    David; and the whole life should be complete in righteous action. No
    flaw in our dealings with each other.
6.  **“Frontlets”** (Deut. 6:8; Exodus 13:16; Deut. 11:18). The Word of
    the Lord was to be as “frontlets between the eyes,” that is, their
    thought and sight were to be ruled by the truth of God. What a
    difference it would make in the life, if the Word of the Lord dwelt
    in us richly (Col. 3:16), it would then be held forth more
    effectively (Philippians 2:16). We need the tongue of the taught to
    teach (Isaiah 50:4, R.V.).
7.  **“Write”** (Deut. 6:9). Written on the posts and gates of the
    house, that all who come to the house may see and observe.

“All this is perfectly beautiful. The Word of God written in the heart;
flowing out in loving instruction to the children in the bosom of the
family; shining out in all the activities of the daily life, so that all
who came inside the gates or entered the house might see that the Word
of the Lord was the standard for each, for all, and in everything.”
# 327. Rest

1.  **Rest of Salvation.** “Stand still, and see the salvation of the
    Lord” (Ex. 14:13).
2.  **Rest of Conscience** about our sins. “I will give you rest”
    (Matthew 11:28).
3.  **Rest from the fear of Judgment.** “There is, therefore, now no
    condemnation” (Rom. 8:1; John 5:24).
4.  **Rest from fear of death.** “Though I walk through the valley of
    the shadow of death, I will fear no evil” (Psalm 23:4).
5.  **Rest from the power of sin.** “Because we have sought the Lord…He
    hath given us rest” (2 Chron. 14:7).
6.  **Rest of heart** in fellowship with Christ. “Take My yoke…ye shall
    find rest” (Matt. 11:29).
7.  **Rest in Service** from doubt and anxiety. “We which have believed
    do enter into rest” (Heb. 4:3).
8.  **Rest from the presence of sin** in glory. “There remaineth
    therefore a rest to the people of God” (Heb. 4:9).

\




# 328. Results of Abiding in Christ

1.  **Walking as Christ walked.** “So to walk, even as He walked” (1
    John 2:6).
2.  **Loving the brethren.** “He that loveth his brother abideth in the
    light” (1 John 2:10).
3.  **Not ashamed at Christ’s coming.** “And not be ashamed before Him
    at His coming” (1 John 2:28).
4.  **Sinning not.** “Whosoever abideth in Him, sinneth not” (1 John
    3:6).
5.  **The witness of the Spirit.** “We know He abideth in us, by the
    Spirit” (1 John 3:24).
6.  **Possessing the Father and Son.** “He that abideth…he hath both the
    Father and Son” (2 John 9).
7.  **Prayers answered.** “If ye abide in Me….ye shall ask what ye will”
    (John 15:7).
8.  **Fruit-bearing.** “He that abideth…bringeth forth much fruit” (John
    15:5).

# 329. Resurrection of Christ

THE resurrection of Christ is the *heart* of Christianity, which makes
it pulsate with the life of God; it is the *keystone* to the arch of
truth, which holds all the faith of the Gospel together; it is the
*foundation* of the Church; it is the *mainspring* of Christian
activity; it is the *lever* of power which shall move the world; and it
is the *link* that unites all believers.

The death of Christ tells us of the *love* of *God*, and the
resurrection of Christ tells us of the *power* of *God*, and of the
following seven facts:—

1.  That God is satisfied and glorified (Romans 8:33-34).
2.  That our sins are gone (Eph. 1:7).
3.  That we are accepted in Christ (Eph. 1:6).
4.  That we are united to Christ (Col. 2:12; 3:1).
5.  That every foe is vanquished (Col. 2:15).
6.  That we shall for ever live with Him (John 14:19).
7.  That the Spirit is given to the believer (John 7:39).

Further, the resurrection of Christ was announced in the Scriptures. The
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, were “according to the
Scriptures.” Mainly the Old Testament is meant when the New Testament
speaks of “the Scriptures.” Where, in the Old Testament is the
resurrection of Christ mentioned? Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, by the
Holy Spirit, says in the “sixteenth Psalm” (Psalm 16:8-11; Acts
2:24-32); and Paul at Antioch says in the “second Psalm” (Psalm 2:7;
Acts 13:32-37). The God-breathed Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:16) were the basis
and the authority of the utterance of the apostles, therefore they had
an authority above all question, for “where the word of a king is, there
is power” (Eccles. 8:4); and the hearers who received their message had
a solid rock upon which to rest, which could never be moved (1
Corinthians 15:1-4).
# 330. Sacrifice of Christ

1.  **Necessary Sacrifice.** “What the law could not do, in that it was
    weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of
    sinful flesh, and by a *sacrifice* for sin (margin), condemned sin
    in the flesh” (Rom. 8:3).
2.  **Offered Sacrifice.** “Who needeth not daily to offer up
    *sacrifice*….He offered up Himself” (Heb. 7:27).
3.  **Removing Sacrifice.** “Put away sin by the *sacrifice* of Himself”
    (Heb. 9:26).
4.  **Perfect Sacrifice.** “Offered one *sacrifice* for sins for ever”
    (Hebrews 10:12).
5.  **Accepted Sacrifice.** “Christ….hath given Himself for us, an
    offering and a *sacrifice* to God for a sweet smelling savour”
    (Ephesians 5:2).
6.  **Substitutionary Sacrifice.** “Christ, our Passover, is
    *sacrificed* for us (1 Cor. 5:7).
7.  **Remembered Sacrifice.** “Gather My saints together unto Me, those
    that have made a covenant with Me by *sacrifice*” (Psalm 50:5).

\




# 331. Sacrifice, the Ground of Blessing

SACRIFICE is the ground of all God’s bestowments and blessings. There is
one principle which runs through the Scriptures from end to end, like
the lead in a pencil, and that is, that all God’s approaches to man, and
all man’s approaches to Him, are on the ground of sacrifice.

1.  **Acceptance.** Abel’s acceptance with the Lord (Heb. 11:4).
2.  **Regeneration.** Noah’s looking out on a new world in covenant
    promise (Gen. 8:20-21).
3.  **Preservation.** Israel’s protection in Egypt (Ex. 12:13).
4.  **Access.** Entrance into the holiest of all in the tabernacle
    (Leviticus 16:14).
5.  **Cleansing.** Cleansing of the leper (Lev. 14:6).
6.  **Consecration.** Consecration of the temple (1 Kings 8:5).
7.  **Bestowment.** The bestowment of a kingdom (1 Sam. 16:1-5).

All the above blessings and many more, are grounded upon sacrifice.
# 332. Safeguards

THE safeguards are connected with the word “lest” in the Epistle to the
Hebrews.

1.  **Hearing.** “Give the more earnest heed to the things which we have
    heard, *lest* at any time we should let them slip” (Heb. 2:1).
2.  **Heeding.** “Take heed, brethren, *lest* there be in any of you an
    evil heart of unbelief” (Hebrews 3:12).
3.  **Exhorting.** “Exhort one another daily,….*lest* any of you be
    hardened through the deceitfulness of sin” (Heb. 3:13).
4.  **Labouring.** “Labour, therefore, to enter into that rest, *lest*
    any man fall after the same example of disobedience” (Heb. 4:11,
    M.).
5.  **Considering.** “Consider Him….*lest* ye be wearied and faint”
    (Heb. 12:3).
6.  **Making.** “Make straight paths for your feet, *lest* that which is
    lame be turned out of the way” (Heb. 12:13).
7.  **Looking.** “Looking diligently, *lest* any man fail of the grace
    of God: *lest* any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and
    thereby many be defiled” (Heb. 12:15).

\




# 333. Safety

THE following is a sevenfold illustration of the Christian’s safety as
found in the Old Testament.

1.  **Jehovah’s name.** The safety of the name of Jehovah is as a
    **tower** to befriend in the time of need (Proverbs 18:10).
2.  **Jehovah’s presence.** The safety of God’s presence is a
    **covering** to protect in danger (Deut. 33:12).
3.  **Jehovah’s promise.** The safety of God’s promise is a **refuge**
    from the snare of fear (Proverbs 29:25).
4.  **Jehovah’s power.** The safety of God’s power is an **uplifter** to
    put us out of the enemy’s reach (Psalm 12:5).
5.  **Jehovah’s arm.** The safety of God’s arm is a **strengthener** to
    sustain at all times (Psalm 119:117).
6.  **Jehovah’s leading.** The safety of God’s leading is a
    **safeguard** in all difficulty (Psalm 78:53).
7.  **Jehovah’s keeping.** The safety of God’s keeping is a **minister**
    of calm repose (Psalm 4:8).

\




# 334. Salvation

SALVATION, like God, is a trinity. It has a past, present, and future
aspect to the believer in Christ.

1.  **Past salvation.** Those who are Christ’s are saved from what they
    deserve as sinners, because Christ has died for them and borne in
    His body the curse that sin merits (Gal. 3:13; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Thess.
    1:10; Eph. 2:8; 2 Tim. 1:9).
2.  **Present salvation.** Believers are being saved from the despotism
    of sin as they abide in Christ and look to Him who lives in the
    power of an endless life (Rom. 5:9; Heb. 7:25), and who, by the Holy
    Spirit, is able to work in us mightily, so that we can work out our
    own salvation with fear and trembling (Phil. 2:12).
3.  **Future Salvation.** The Lord’s children will be saved from the
    disgrace of sin when Christ returns; hence we wait for Him as a
    Saviour (Phil. 3:20); for this we are kept (1 Peter 1:5), and for
    this Christ will return (Heb. 9:28). It is this aspect of salvation
    of which the Lord says, “It is nearer” (Rom. 13:11).

# 336. Sameness of Christ

CHRIST is the Ever-living, Immutable, and Unchanging One.

1.  **Christ’s eternal relationship with God.** “The *same* was in the
    beginning with God” (John 1:2).
2.  **Christ’s identity known by what He 999:** “The *same* is He who
    baptizeth with the Holy Ghost” (John 1:33).
3.  **Christ’s exaltation because of His faithful work.** “God hath made
    that *same* Jesus….Lord and Christ” (Acts 2:36).
4.  **Christ’s return.** “This *same* Jesus, which is taken up from you
    into heaven, shall so come” (Acts 1:11).
5.  **Christ’s immutability.** “Thou are the *same* and Thy years shall
    not fail” (Heb. 1:12).
6.  **The Holy Spirit’s Testimony.** “Jesus Christ the *same* yesterday,
    and to-day, and for ever” (Heb. 13:8).

\




# 337. Samson, a Type of Christ

1.  **An angel foretold his birth.** “Angel….said….lo, thou shall
    conceive, and bear a son” (Judges 13:3-5). So it was in the case of
    Christ. “Angel said…thou shall conceive…and bring forth a Son” (Luke
    1:30-31).
2.  **He was separated unto God.** “No razor shall come on his head: for
    the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb” (Judges 13:5).
    Even so it was with Christ. “He shall be called a Nazarene” (Matt.
    2:23).
3.  **He acted in the power of the Holy Spirit.** “The Spirit of the
    Lord began to move him” (Judges 13:25). “The Spirit of the Lord came
    mightily upon him” (Judges 14:6; 15:14). The same was true of
    Christ. “Holy Ghost descended upon Him”; “Jesus, being full of the
    Holy Ghost….led by the Spirit”; “returned in the power of the
    Spirit”; “the Spirit of the Lord is upon Me” (Luke 3:22; 4:1, 14,
    18).
4.  **He was mighty to overcome his enemies.** “He found a new jaw-bone
    of an ass, and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand
    men therewith” (Judges 15:15). As Samson used a dead jaw-bone as the
    instrument to overcome his enemies, even so Christ, by His own
    death, has destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the
    devil (Heb. 2:14).
5.  **He was treated unkindly by his own people.** “Her father said, I
    verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her (his wife),
    therefore I gave her to thy companion” (Judges 15:2). As Samson’s
    wife was given to another by her father-thus they rejected him-so
    the Jews, by their sin and unbelief, rejected Christ and gave
    themselves into the power of Satan, for Christ came to His own, but
    they received Him not (John 1:11).
6.  **He was misused and mocked.** “She began to afflict him….put out
    his eyes….bound him with fetters of brass, and he did grind in the
    prison house….he made them sport” (Judges 16:19, 21, 25). As Samson
    was ill-used, even so was Christ. He was “despised and rejected of
    men, a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3).
7.  **He destroyed more enemies by his death than he ever did in his
    life.** “So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they
    which he slew in his life” (Judges 16:30). Even so with Christ. By
    His death He has been the death of death; He has robbed death of its
    sting, the grave of its terrors, sin of its power, and Satan of his
    authority.

# 338. Sanctification of the Levites

THE Levites were set apart from their brethren for the service of the
tabernacle. Notice the points of similarity between the Levites and
believers:—

1.  **Choice.** “Take the Levites” (Num. 8:6). “As many as Thou hast
    given Him” (John 17:2).
2.  **Cleansing.** “Cleanse them” (Num. 8:6). “Now ye are clean” (John
    15:3).
3.  **Supplication.** “Offer the Levites” (Num. 8:11). “I pray for them”
    (John 17:9).
4.  **Claiming.** “The Levites shall be Mine” (Num. 8:14). “They are
    Thine” (John 17:9).
5.  **Service.** “To do the service” (Num. 8:15). “Even so have I also
    sent them into the world” (John 17:18).
6.  **Given** to Aaron (Num. 8:19). “Thou gavest them Me” (John 17:6).
7.  **Separation.** “Separate the Levites” (Num. 8:14). “Sanctify them”
    (John 17:17).

\




# 339. “Sanctify Yourselves”

JOSHUA 3:5

How can we sanctify ourselves (2 Cor. 7:1)? In the following sevenfold
manner:—

1.  By the mortification of the old sinful nature within us (Col. 3:5;
    Rom. 8:12-13).
2.  By the expulsion from our life of all evil habits (Col. 3:9;
    Galatians 5:24).
3.  By the denial of self itself, in ignoring its existence (Luke
    9:23-24).
4.  By the enthronement of Christ in the heart by the Spirit (Eph. 3:17;
    1 Peter 3:15, R.V.).
5.  By being satisfied with Christ through heart fellowship with Him
    (Matt. 11:29; Psalm 73:25).
6.  By delighting in God’s will and control (Ps. 40:8; 1 Thess. 5:18).
7.  By making it our aim to do all things to the glory of God (1
    Corinthians 10:31).

# 340. Satan, a Serpent

GENESIS 3:1-15

THERE are five things we notice in relation to Satan-

1.  **Those who are down themselves will often seek to drag others to
    the same level.** We read of the serpent, the devil, and as
    suggestive of his character, that it “*was more subtle*,” (Gen.
    3:1). The question naturally arises, how had the serpent become more
    subtle? It seems to suggest that Satan had become subtle through
    sin, for the words “was more subtle” would be more correctly
    translated, “had become more subtle.” Having sinned, Satan seeks to
    lead others to act in a like manner.
2.  **Satan often uses the creatures of God to carry out his own
    purpose.** He used the *hands* of Achan to take the wedge of gold
    (Joshua 7:1), the *lips* of Ananias and his wife to lie to the Holy
    Spirit (Acts 5:3), the *mind* of Judas to conceive the betrayal of
    Christ (John 13:27), the *eyes* of Lot to look towards Sodom (Gen.
    13:10, 12), the *feet* of Abram to go down into Egypt (Gen. 12:10),
    the *words* of Peter to deny Christ (Luke 22:57), and the serpent to
    deceive Eve.
3.  **Satan’s policy is to get men to doubt the truth of God’s word.**
    Notice Satan’s question in Gen. 3:1, as suggesting a doubt; and then
    ponder his boldness as seen in his words in Gen. 3:4, contrasting
    his words with God’s plain command in Gen. 2:17, as understood
    according to the woman’s statement in Gen. 3:3; and the wicked,
    lying imputation of Satan upon God’s goodness in Gen. 3:5.
4.  **Satan’s character is symbolized in the serpent.** The serpent is
    crooked (Isaiah 27:1), poisonous (Psalm 58:4), bites (Prov. 23:32;
    Eccles. 10:8, 11; Amos 5:19; 9:3); has a divided tongue (Psalm
    140:3), has a gliding motion (Prov. 30:19), conceals itself
    (Ecclesiastes 10:8; Amos 5:19), and its sound is threatening
    (Jeremiah 46:22). That “old serpent” is one of the devil’s names
    (Revelation 20:2).
5.  **Satan and the serpent are both punished.** The former by having
    his head bruised (Gen. 3:15), and the latter by crawling upon the
    ground, and eating dust (Gen. 3:14). As the receiver of stolen goods
    is punished as well as he that stole them, so the one who allows
    himself to be led into sin by Satan, is punished as well as he who
    leads into sin.

# 341. Saved

1.  **Saved by grace** as to the source of salvation. “By grace ye are
    saved” (Eph. 2:5).
2.  **Saved by Christ** as to the means of salvation. “By Me if any man
    enter in, he shall be saved” (John 10:9).
3.  **Saved by the Holy Spirit** as to the regeneration and renewal of
    salvation. “Regeneration, and renewing of, the Holy Ghost” (Titus
    3:5).
4.  **Saved by faith** as to the reception of salvation. “Thy faith hath
    saved thee” (Luke 7:50).
5.  **Saved by the Gospel** as to the knowledge of salvation. “By which
    also ye are saved….I preached unto you” (1 Cor. 15:2).
6.  **Saved by the risen life of Christ** as to the keeping of
    salvation. “We shall be saved by His life” (Rom. 5:10).
7.  **Saved by abiding in Christ** as to the fruitfulness of salvation
    “Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved” (Acts 27:31).
8.  **Saved by baptism** as to the confession of salvation. “Baptism
    doth also now save us” (1 Peter 3:21).
9.  **Saved by hope** as to the prospect of salvation. “We are saved by
    hope” (Rom. 8:24).
10. **Saved by endurance** as to the reality of salvation. “He that
    endureth to the end shall be saved” (Matt. 10:22).
11. **Saved by fire** as to service. “He himself shall be saved, yet so
    as by fire” (1 Cor. 3:15).

\




# 342. Saviour

THE BIRTH OF CHRIST (LUKE 2:8-20).

THE Incarnation of Christ is one of the pillars to the temple of truth,
for as the kinsman only could redeem the lost inheritance of an
Israelite (Lev. 25:25; Ruth 4:10), so Christ had to become our Kinsman,
to have the *right* to redeem us (Heb. 2:14).

I shall take the title “Saviour” and give an acrostic upon it, as
illustrating the purpose for which Christ was born, and as indicating
the scope of His work.

**S** Suitable Saviour.

**A**Almighty Saviour.

**V**Vicarious Saviour.

** I**Immutable Saviour.

**O**Only Saviour.

**U**Universal Saviour.

**R**Royal Saviour.

\

 **S Suitable Saviour** (1 Tim. 1:15). 
:   As the key fits the lock and turns the wards of it, so Christ suits
    the sinner, in that He can turn him from darkness to light. As the
    medicine which is effective in its operation overcomes the disease
    and banishes it from the system of the patient, so Christ is the
    medicine for the soul, for in His blood there is cleansing, in His
    life there is quickening, in His death there is reconciliation, and
    in Himself there is every spiritual blessing. We may say with the
    litttle boy who put out one of his hands and, pointing to each
    finger with the forefinger of the other hand, made an acrostic on
    the name “Jesus.”
:   ### Jesus Exactly Suits Us Sinners

 **A Almighty Saviour** (Acts 5:31). 
:   All authority belongs to Christ (Matt. 28:18), and all strength is
    His (2 Cor. 12:9). As the huge crane can lift up the heavy goods, so
    Christ can lift up the sinner from the horrible pit (Psalm 40:2). As
    the engine can draw the heavy train, so Christ makes us go along the
    lines of God’s truth in glad obedience to His will. As the
    quickening word of Christ brought Lazarus from the grave (John
    11:43-44); so He can quicken those who are dead in trespasses and
    sins (Eph. 2:1).
 **V Vicarious Saviour** (Matt. 27:42). 
:   The title “*vicar*” means one who supplies the place of another;
    hence, speaking of Christ being a “vicarious Saviour” refers to the
    fact that He was a Substitute for those who believe in Him when He
    died upon the cross (2 Cor. 5:21). Think of the many times it is
    said, “Christ died for us.” As the ram was offered up in the stead
    of Isaac (Gen. 22:13), so Christ was offered instead of us (Eph.
    5:2).
 **I Immutable Saviour** (Heb. 7:24). 
:   He is the unchanging One. The same yesterday, to-day, and for ever
    (Heb. 13:8). The yesterday of the Cross, the to-day at the right
    hand of God, and the for ever in the glory, find Him unchanging in
    the intensity of His love, in the preciousness of His promises, in
    the strength of His power, in the tenderness of His sympathy, in the
    sufficiency of His grace, and in the longing of His heart. His heart
    ever beats in love towards us. His hand is ever ready to aid us.
 **O Only Saviour** (Acts 4:12). 
:   There is no other than the Lord Jesus who can meet our need and
    satisfy the claims of God. As He alone could span over the great
    gulf which sin had made, by His atoning death, so He alone can bring
    us from the land of darkness and death into His life, light, and
    liberty. As the door of the house is the way by which entrance is
    obtained to it, so Christ is the door through which we enter into
    the blessing of salvation (John 10:9; 14:6).
 **U Universal Saviour** (John 10:9). 
:   Christ is not a universal Saviour in the sense of saving everybody
    whether they will or not, but He offers to save “any
    man”-“whosoever” will accept Him. There is a tradesman in the
    West-end of London who calls himself “The Universal Provider.” It
    does not mean that he provides for everyone, but he is willing to do
    so. In a like manner Christ offers Himself as a Saviour to all, but
    it is only those who receive Him who know Him as their Saviour.
 **R Royal Saviour** (Luke 2:11). 
:   The Saviour is “Christ the Lord.” He is no mere man; He is Lord of
    lords, King of kings-very God. He is royal in name, royal in office,
    royal in nature, royal in speech, royal in action, royal in death,
    royal in resurrection, royal in ascension, royal in His word, and
    royal in glory.

# 343. Saviour of Life or Death

II. CORINTHIANS 2:16

*Christ is one of two things to all*. He is either the Stone on which we
are broken in penitence and to salvation, or He is the Stone to grind in
pieces unto punishment and condemnation (Luke 20:18). This is brought
out in the following sevenfold contrasts:

1.  The pillar of cloud was **light** to Israel, and **darkness** to the
    Egyptians (Ex. 14:20).
2.  The ways of the Lord are to walk in for our **blessing**, or ways to
    stumble in to our **hurt** (Hosea 14:9).
3.  God is a **consuming fire** to **purify** His people (Mal. 3:3), and
    a **burning fire** to **scorch** His enemies (Mal. 4:1).
4.  Christ is **life** to those who receive Him (John 3:36), while He is
    **wrath** to those who reject Him (Rev. 6:16).
5.  Christ is the **Chief Corner-stone** to those who rest on Him in
    faith for salvation (1 Peter 2:6), while He is a **Stone** of
    **Stumbling** to those who will not have Him (1 Peter 2:8).
6.  Christ is **precious** to those who believe (1 Peter 2:7), while He
    is **despised** by those who neglect Him (Isaiah 53:3).
7.  When Christ comes He brings **eternal rest** for His people, but He
    gives **eternal destruction** to those who have not obeyed the
    Gospel (2 Thess. 1:6-7).

# 344. Seeing

“HE….came seeing” (John 9:7), so it is said of the blind man. The
believer sees the following seven things:—

1.  **Sin in his members.** “I *see* another law in my members” (Romans
    7:23).
2.  **Jesus crowned with glory.** “We *see* Jesus” (Heb. 2:9).
3.  **The calling of grace.** “Ye *see* your calling, brethren” (1 Cor.
    1:26).
4.  **An open heaven.** “Hereafter ye shall *see* heaven open” (John
    1:51).
5.  **God, as he is pure in heart.** “Blessed are the pure in heart, for
    they shall *see* God” (Matt. 5:8).
6.  **The evil of unbelief.** “We *see* that they could not enter in
    because of unbelief” (Heb. 3:19).
7.  **The day of the Lord approaching.** “Ye *see* the day approaching”
    (Heb. 10:25).

\




# 345. Seeing the Lord

1.  **Seeing the Lord brings conviction.** “I have heard of Thee by the
    hearing of the ear; but now mine eye *seeth* Thee” (Job 42:5; Isaiah
    6:1).
2.  **Seeing the Lord brings salvation.** “Fear ye not, stand still, and
    *see* the salvation of the Lord, which He will shew to you to-day”
    (Ex. 14:13).
3.  **Seeing the Lord as the Object of faith.** “But we *see* Jesus, who
    was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death
    crowned with glory” (Heb. 2:9).
4.  **Seeing the Lord brings deliverance.** “But when he *saw* Jesus
    afar off, he ran and worshipped Him” (Mark 5:6).
5.  **Seeing the Lord brings joy.** “Then were the disciples glad, when
    they *saw* the Lord” (John 20:20).
6.  **Seeing the Lord is attraction.** “And looking upon Jesus as He
    walked, he saith, *Behold* the Lamb of God” (John 1:36).
7.  **Seeing the Lord will be likeness.** “When He shall appear, we
    shall be like Him; for we shall *see* Him as He is” (1 John 3:2).


# 346. Self-Confidence

II. CHRONICLES 25:17-28

ONE of the saddest things that can be witnessed, is, when a person has
known the Lord and goes away from Him (2 Chron. 25:2, 27; Gal. 5:7).
Self-confidence is the child of half-heartedness.

1.  **Self-confidence looks earthward instead of heavenward.** The king
    of Judah “took advice” (2Chron. 25:17), not from God but from men.
2.  **Self-confidence acts in its own strength.** Amaziah “sent,” and
    said (2Chron. 25:17). He who sides with self takes sides against
    God, and runs on a rock to his own destruction.
3.  **Self-confidence is fostered by wrong.** Idolatry was the hot-bed
    that caused the self-confidence of Amaziah to flourish (2Chron.
    25:20).
4.  **Self-confidence is the forerunner of defeat.** “Put to the worse”
    (2Chron. 25:22) is ever the summary of the life of the child of the
    flesh.
5.  **Self-confidence meets with bondage, damage, and loss.** The king
    of Israel “took” the king of Judah and “brake” the wall of Jerusalem
    (2Chron. 25:23). Brokenness of spirit (Luke 22:62), and bondage of
    heart are ever the outcome of selfs action (Gal. 5:1).
6.  **Self-confidence reaps what it sows.** Amaziah had conspired
    against God in his self-action, and now he is paid back in his own
    coin in being conspired against (2Chron. 25:27).
7.  **Self-confidence meets with death** (2Chron. 25:27). “Boast,”
    “Would not hear,” “Put to the worse,” “Brought,” “Brake,” “Turn
    away,” “Fled,” “Slain,” are the words that sum up the downgradeism
    of the king of Judah.

# 347. Self-Will

1.  **Self-will turned Paradise into a desert.** It has been well said,
    “My will and not Thine be done, turned Paradise into a desert. Thy
    will and not Mine be done, turned the desert into a Paradise”
    (Romans 5:19).
2.  **Self-will is the mother of sin.** This is illustrated in Cain,
    when he in self-will came to God in his own way instead of God’s
    way, and was jealous because Abel’s sacrifice was accepted and his
    was rejected, which jealousy led him on to kill his brother (Jude
    11).
3.  **Self-will is the forerunner of disaster.** Lot chose the
    well-watered plain of Sodom, and then soon after was found in Sodom,
    but he lost all he had in Sodom, and only escaped with his life (Gen
    13:10).
4.  **Self-will shuts out from blessing.** Moses struck the rock twice
    when God told him to speak to it, and was shut out of the promised
    land in consequence (Num. 20:11-12).
5.  **Self-will brings punishment.** King Saul lost his kingdom and the
    Holy Spirit through consulting his own will in opposition to God’s
    word, when the latter told him to destroy all the Amalekites (1
    Samuel 15:23).
6.  **Self-will brings injury to others.** Peter acted on his own
    authority when he cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest
    (Luke 22:50).
7.  **Self-will means loss of blessing.** The prodigal son found the
    difference between the swine troughs and the father’s table, and
    between the far country and the old homestead (Luke 15:16-17).

# 348. Sent Forth

MATTHEW 10:1-16

THE ones who are sent forth are those whom Christ has chosen, called,
ordained and empowered (Mat. 10:1; Mark 3:13-15; Luke 6:13). As it was
with the Apostles, so it is with believers to-day. Those who are chosen
in Christ (Eph. 1:4), called by Christ (Rom. 8:30), ordained by Him
(John 15:16), and empowered by Him (Acts 1:8), are set apart to work
with Him (2 Cor. 6:1).

Let us look at the directions that Christ gave to His disciples.

1.  They were to be **generous:** “Freely ye have received, freely give”
    (Mat. 10:8). The Lord had not stinted them, in giving them blessing,
    neither were they to hold back the blessing from others. When Samson
    found the honey in the car case of the lion, he took some home to
    his parents (Judges 14:9); when the four lepers came upon the spoil
    of the Syrians, they kept not the good things to themselves, they
    went and informed the inhabitants of the city of Samaria (2 Kings
    7:8-10); even so, those who have received the grace of God, should
    pass it on to others.
2.  The disciples were to be **careless as to their comfort** (Mat.
    10:9-10). They were not to carry a large portmanteau, nor to have a
    bag of gold with them. In the East it was customary to give
    hospitality to those who asked for it. Customs are not the same with
    us in the West, although all who are the Lord’s should ever be
    willing to extend hospitality to the servants of Christ. Those who
    have the love of souls will not be careful of their own ease and
    comfort (1 Thess. 2:8-9).
3.  The disciples were to be **courteous.** When they came to a house
    they were to “salute” it (Mat. 10:12). Their salutation “Peace be to
    this house,” or “Peace be unto you,” would be the benediction of
    God. A Christian should always be a walking blessing, shedding forth
    the fragrance of Christ wherever he goes, and this shall be so, as
    Christ dwells in the heart; for as scent in the clothes will betray
    itself, so Christ will be known when He lives in the soul.
4.  The disciples were to be **independent** (Mat. 10:14). If the people
    to whom they went would not receive them nor their message, then
    they were not to force themselves upon these unwilling persons, but
    to shake the dust off their feet, as indicating that they would not
    take the dust of their floors from them; as Trapp says, “In token
    that you sought not theirs but them, and that you will not carry
    away so much as any of their dust.”
5.  The disciples were to be **patient.** They were to be as “sheep”
    (Mat. 10:16). No one can read the history of the Church without
    being impressed with the correctness of the Saviour’s simile in
    comparing the disciples of Christ to sheep in the midst of wolves.
    Mr. Fox relates how the Christians in Calabria, in 1560, were thrust
    into one house as in a sheepfold, and how the executioner came and
    fetched them out one by one and butchered them all, to the number of
    eighty-eight.
6.  The disciples were to be **wise** (Mat. 10:16). Matthew Henry
    remarks: “Wise-not as foxes, whose cunning is to deceive others-but
    as serpents, whose policy is to defend themselves, and to shift for
    their own safety.”
7.  The disciples were to be “**harmless** as doves” (Mat. 10:16). It is
    related of Francis Xavier, that as he was preaching in one of the
    cities of Japan, a man went up to him, pretending that he had
    something to communicate in private. Upon his approach, Xavier
    leaned his head to hear what he had to say. The scorner thus gained
    his object, which was to spit freely upon the face of the devoted
    missionary, and thus to insult him in the most public manner.
    Xavier, without speaking a word or showing any sign of annoyance,
    took out his pocket handkerchief, wiped his face, and went on with
    his sermon, as if nothing had happened to interrupt him. By such an
    heroic control of his passions, the scorn of the audience was turned
    into admiration. The most learned doctor of the city, who happened
    to be present, said to himself, that a law which taught men such
    virtue, inspired them with such courage, and gave them such complete
    mastery over themselves, could not but be from God. Afterwards he
    desired baptism, and his example was followed by others. So
    effectually did the meekness of the missionary promote the success
    of the work.

# 349. Separation

GOD divided the light from the darkness; the waters from the waters, and
the day from the night (Genesis 1:4, 7, 14, 18). As in the beginning, so
is it now with the Christian and the world. We have several
illustrations of this in the Books of Moses. We shall take seven, and
give the corresponding truths from the New Testament.

1.  **Separation.** Division between light and darkness. “What communion
    hath light with darkness” (2 Cor. 6:14).
2.  **Manifestation.** “I will put a division between My people and thy
    people” (Ex. 8:23). “In this” (sinning and not sinning, see 1 John
    3:8-9) “the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
    devil” (1 John 3:10).
3.  **Conversation.** “Ye shall therefore put difference between clean
    beasts and unclean, &c.” (Lev. 20:25). “As He which hath called you
    is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of living” (1 Peter 1:13-16,
    R.V.).
4.  **Dedication.** “All the days of his separation he is holy unto the
    Lord” (Num. 6:8). “Be ye separate” (2 Cor. 6:17).
5.  **Isolation.** “The people shall dwell alone” (Num. 23:9). “Be not
    conformed to this world” (Rom. 12:2).
6.  **Sanctification.** “Thou shalt not plow with an ox and ass
    together” (Deut. 22:10). “Be ye not unequally yoked together with
    unbelievers” (2 Cor. 6:14).
7.  **Consecration.** “Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts”
    (Deut. 22:11). “Put off the old man with his deeds” (Col. 3:9). “Put
    ye on the Lord Jesus” (Rom. 13:14).

# 350. Service

S Sent one to witness.

E Epistle to be read.

R Representative to manifest forth.

V Voice to speak.

 I Instrument to be used.

C Child to obey.

E Endowed one with power.

\

 S Sent one to witness. 
:   “Christ” means the Anointed or Sent One. Forty-three times in John’s
    Gospel alone, do we find Him saying that His Father sent Him. The
    authority of Jesus as the Sent One was, that His Father sent Him;
    the evidence that He was the Sent One was, that He did the will of
    the Father (John 4:34), that He honoured the Father, and that His
    works were a witness that He was sent by the Father (John 5:36); and
    His confidence was, that He was speaking His Father’s word in His
    Father’s Name (John 7:16, and 14:24). And as the Father sent Jesus,
    so Christ has sent us (John 20:21), and our authority and confidence
    are, that Christ has sent us in His Name, with His Word, to do His
    will, that we may bring honour to His Name by our life and testimony
    bearing witness to Him.
 **E Epistle to be read** (2 Cor. 3:3). 
:   Paul in this passage seems to say, “We do not need any letter of
    commendation of ourself to you; for you, who were blessed under our
    ministry, are our epistle, known and read of all men.” “Forasmuch as
    ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by
    us, written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not
    in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables ot the heart.” That is, the
    work of the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the Word is
    manifestly seen by the life that we are now living, and the world
    sees the work of God by its manifestation in our godly walk. It has
    often been said, and said truly, that while the world will not read
    the Word of God, they will read the Christian, and can Christ be
    glorified in us more, than when they take knowledge of us that
    Christ is manifestly seen in our walk?
 **R Representative to manifest forth** (1 John 2:8). 
:   When Christ was here, He represented the Father. “He that hath seen
    Me hath seen the Father.” Christ represented us on the cross by
    taking our sin, and now, as our great High Priest, He represents us
    at God’s right-hand. The Spirit having quickened us, the light of
    the glorious Gospel having shone into our hearts, and chased the
    darkness of sin and unbelief away, we are to let our light shine. As
    John says, “Which thing is true in Him” (Christ), “and in you:
    because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.” That
    is, when Jesus was here, He was the Light of the world; but now we
    are the light of the world (a very poor light at the best), and we
    are responsible to shine as such, holding forth the Word of Life.
 V Voice to speak. 
:   John the Baptist said that he was the voice of one crying in the
    wilderness; and we are to speak for Christ. How many souls, humanly
    speaking, are lost for want of a word! We should speak out boldly,
    like Peter on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14); lovingly, like
    Stephen when praying for his enemies (Acts 7:60); earnestly, like
    Paul when he said to the jailor, “Do thyself no harm” (Acts 16:28).
 I Instrument to be used. 
:   There are different kinds of instruments mentioned in the Word,
    which may be taken as illustrating what the Christian is and should
    be. An instrument is something that is taken up and used by another.
 C Child to obey. 
:   “A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master” (Mal. 1:6).
    And how do they do this but by obedience to them? Even so we obey
    the Lord.
 E Endowed one with power. 
:   Service with Him as Christ. As we have already said, “Christ” not
    only means the Sent One, but the Anointed One. He was anointed with
    the Holy Spirit, and we as Christians are therefore anointed ones.
    We have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, and He is our
    power in service; therefore, let us be subject to Him, and thus will
    the “Name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified in us.”

# 351. Seven “I Have's” of Paul to Timothy

1.  **Remembrance.** “*I have* remembrance of thee” (2 Timothy 1:3).
    Remembering others at the throne of grace, brings blessing upon
    ourselves, as well as upon them.
2.  **Faith.** “*I have* believed” (2 Timothy 1:12). The man who has
    believed in Christ, knows it, and can speak accordingly.
3.  **Committal.** “*I have* committed unto Him” (2 Timothy 1:12). To
    trust ourselves to the Lord’s keeping is to be safe, sure, and
    happy.
4.  **Conflict.** “*I have* fought a good fight” (2 Timothy 4:7). To
    fight for right and truth, is to fight a good fight.
5.  **Completion.** “*I have* finished my course” (2 Timothy 4:7). To
    look back and see that what we attempted has been accomplished,
    brings content.
6.  **Fidelity.** “*I have* kept the faith” (2 Timothy 4:7). To be
    faithful, means the “well done” for a reward.
7.  **Commission.** “Tychicus *I have* sent to Ephesus” (2 Timothy
    4:12). If we cannot go on an errand of mercy, let us send another in
    our place.

# 352. Seven L's in Relation to the Home in Bethany

1.  **Loved by Christ.** “Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and
    Lazarus” (John 11:5).
2.  **Listening to Christ.** “Sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard His word”
    (Luke 10:39).
3.  **Labouring for Christ.** “Martha…serving” (Luke 10:40).
4.  **Longing for Christ.** “His sisters sent unto Him” (John 11:3).
5.  **Light through Christ.** “Take ye away the stone” (John 11:39).
6.  **Life in Christ.** “Lazarus, come forth” (John 11:43).
7.  **Liberty by Christ.** “Loose him, and let him go” (John 11:44).

# 353. Seven Looks

1.  **Outward look of salvation.** “*Look* unto Me, and be ye saved”
    (Isaiah 45:22).
2.  **Outward look in service.** “*Look* on the fields” (John 4:35).
3.  **Upward look of faith.** “Will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and
    will *look* up” (Psalm 5:3).
4.  **Inward look of enquiry.** “Whoso *looketh* into the perfect law of
    liberty” (James 1:25).
5.  **Inward look of examination.** “*Look* to yourselves” (2 John 8).
6.  **Onward look of perseverance.** “Let thine eyes *look* right on”
    (Proverbs 4:25). “*Looking* unto Jesus” (Heb. 12:2).
7.  **Onward look of expectancy.** “We *look* for the Saviour”
    (Philippians 3:20).

# 354. Seven Positions the Lord Holds for His People

1.  **Within us**-Power. “Christ liveth in me” (Gal. 2:20).
2.  **Before us**-Example. “When He putteth forth His own sheep, He
    goeth before them” (John 10:4).
3.  **Above us**-Representative. “To appear in the presence of God for
    us” (Hebrews 9:24).
4.  **Beneath us**-Sustainer. “Underneath are the everlasting arms”
    (Deuteronomy 33:27).
5.  **Beside us**-Guide. “He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved”
    (Psalm 16:8).
6.  **Around us**-Deliverer. “The Angel of the Lord encampeth round
    about them that fear Him” (Psalm 34:7).
7.  **Behind us**-Protector. “The God of Israel will be your Rereward”
    (Isaiah 52:12).

# 355. Seven “It Is Enough's”

THE principal thought in connection with the words “It is enough,” is,
that a requirement has been met, or satisfaction has been given.

1.  **Pharaoh’s cry of fear.** “Entreat the Lord (for *it is enough*)
    that there be no more mighty thunderings” (Exodus 9:28). When the
    sinner sees that his sin calls forth the judgment of God, it makes
    him cry out with dread.
2.  **The Saviour’s word of resignation.** “*It is enough*, the hour is
    come” (Mark 14:41). Christ knew it was inevitable that He should be
    delivered into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, that the
    purpose of God might be fulfilled (Acts 2:23).
3.  **Jehovah’s word of satisfaction.** “*It is enough*: stay now thine
    hand” (2 Sam. 24:16; 1 Chron. 21:15), were the words of Jehovah to
    the destroying angel as He punished Israel for David’s sin. The
    sacrifices offered up stayed the hand of God in judgment (2 Sam.
    24:25; Eph. 5:2).
4.  **Jacob’s cry of assurance.** “They told him all the words of
    Joseph,” &c. “Israel said, *it is enough*” (Gen. 45:27-28). The
    words of our Divine Joseph assure us of our interest in Him (John
    3:36; 5:24); and of His joy in us (Neh. 8:10).
5.  **Christ’s word of fellowship.** “*It is enough* for the disciple
    that he be as his Master” (Matt. 10:25). It should be a joy to the
    disciples of Christ, that they are privileged to suffer for Him
    (Acts 5:41), and with Him (Phil. 3:10).
6.  **The Lord’s word of approbation.** “Here are two swords. And He
    said, *It is enough*” (Luke 22:38). The Lord often allows His people
    to have things for Him, which He does not need. He looks at the
    heart’s desire more than the blundering hand.
7.  **Elijah’s cry of discouragement.** “He requested for himself that
    he might die; and said, *It is enough*” (1 Kings 19:4). What a mercy
    it is that the Lord does not do as we wish, but that He answers our
    prayers as He knows best for our good!

# 356. Seven Men in a Hurry

THERE is a hurry which is loose and disorderly, and there is a haste
which is deliberate and commendable (compare Isaiah 28:16, with Luke
19:5-6).

1.  **A worshipping demoniac.** “When he saw Jesus afar off, he *ran*
    and worshipped Him” (Mark 5:6). The demons, and the man whom they
    possessed, did homage to Christ. Christ is the Object of believers’
    worship.
2.  **An enthusiastic questioner.** “There came one *running*, and
    kneeled to Him, and asked Him, Good Master, what shall I do that I
    may inherit eternal life?” (Mark 10:17). Enthusiasm that is born of
    self-righteousness is worthless. It can ask questions, but it does
    not fulfil directions.
3.  **An earnest seeker.** “He *ran* before, and climbed up into a
    sycamore tree to see Him” (Luke 19:4). A seeking sinner will always
    be discovered by the all-seeing Saviour. Mark the words, “to see
    Him,” and “Jesus saw him.”
4.  **A considerate man.** “One *ran* and filled a sponge full of
    vinegar” (Mark 15:36). When this man heard the Saviour cry, he
    sought to relieve Him by moistening His lips with the sour wine
    (Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36; John 19:29). Christ will remember the
    kindly action, as He remembers every cup of cold water given to Him
    and to His.
5.  **The loving father.** “When he was yet a great way off, his father
    saw him, and had compassion, and *ran*,” &c. (Luke 15:20). This is
    the only time in the Bible that we read of God being in haste. “He
    said,” and it was done, in creation. “He *ran*” and welcomed the
    prodigal, in redemption.
6.  **The curious disciples.** “They *ran* both together” (John 20:4).
    Mary Magdalene proclaims that the tomb is empty, in which the body
    of Christ was laid. Peter and John cannot believe their ears, so
    they run to the sepulchre to see. Curiosity may lead to enquiry,
    enquiry to faith, faith to love, and love to work.
7.  **A diligent servant.** “Philip *ran* thither to him” (Acts 8:30).
    With an intensity born of the Holy Spirit, Philip hurried forward to
    point the eunuch to Christ the Sin-bearer.

# 357. Seven Moments

THE smallest fraction of time is of importance with the Lord, and where
God speaks of “moments,” it either indicates the constancy of His care,
or the quickness of an action.

1.  **Forsaking.** “For a small *moment* have I forsaken thee”.….”In a
    little wrath I hid My face from thee for a *moment*” (Isaiah
    54:7-8). When the Lord forsakes His people, there is some cause in
    them for His so doing, but He cannot forsake them for long.
2.  **Protecting.** “Hide thyself as it were for a little *moment*,
    until the indignation be over-past” (Isaiah 26:20). God ever
    protects His people first, before He acts in judgment to the world.
    Noah must be in the ark before the flood comes; and Israel must be
    protected by the blood of the Pascal Lamb, before the angel of
    Jehovah smites the first-born.
3.  **Keeping.** “I, the Lord, do keep it. I will water it every
    *moment*” (Isaiah 27:3). He will keep the vineyard from all evil,
    and keep it to all good.
4.  **Trying.** “Try him every *moment*” (Job 7:18). The Lord never
    allows the rust of worldliness to remain on His people. He brightens
    them by His word, and sharpens them by His grace.
5.  **Tempting.** “The devil.….shewed unto Him all the kingdoms of the
    world in a *moment* of time” (Luke 4:5). We have little conception
    of the power which Satan possesses, but, when he can, in a moment of
    time, bring before one the kingdoms of the world, his power must be
    enormous.
6.  **Affliction.** “Our light affliction, which is but for a *moment*”
    (2 Cor. 4:17). The “affliction” is “light,” and only for a “moment”;
    but the “glory” is weighty and “eternal.”
7.  **Transformation.** “We shall all be changed, in a *moment*” (1 Cor.
    15:51-52). The change will be so rapid that there will be no time to
    think about it.

# 358. Strange Things

“WE have seen strange things to-day” (Luke 5:26); so said the people,
after they had seen the working of Christ’s power in the healing of the
palsied man. We shall find many strange things mentioned in the Bible.

1.  **Idolatry.** Strange gods. “Put away the *strange* gods” (Gen.
    35:2). Before there can be communion with God at Bethel, there must
    be separation from idols. There is a Tree where we can bury idols,
    namely, Christ, the Tree of Life, for death with Him is separation
    from things that are strange to Him (2 Corinthians 5:14, R.V.).
2.  **Sacrifice.** Strange fire. “Nadab and Abihu offered *strange* fire
    before the Lord” (Lev. 10:1). To offer strange fire was to take fire
    that had not fed upon a sacrifice, as the Lord had commanded (Ex.
    30:9; Lev. 16:12).
3.  **Degeneration.** Strange vine. “How art thou turned into the
    degenerate plant of a *strange* vine unto Me?” (Jeremiah 2:21).
    Disobedience is the mother of degeneration.
4.  **Disturbers.** Strange doctrines. “Be not carried about with
    *strange* doctrines” (Heb. 13:9). Strange doctrines are the
    teachings of men, which are contrary to the Word of Truth. These are
    as a strong wind which carries the vessel on to the rocks.
5.  **Opposition.** Strange thinking. “They think it *strange* that ye
    run not with them” (1 Peter 4:4). Because the believer will not go
    with the world, the world therefore opposes him.
6.  **Trial.** Trials seemingly strange. “Beloved, think it not
    *strange* concerning the fiery trial” (1 Peter 4:12). Trials are
    like nuts with hard shells. They may be hard like the shells, but
    they have within them the kernels of blessing.
7.  **Judgment.** Strange work. “The Lord shall rise up…and do His
    *strange* work” (Isaiah 28:21). The Lord would much rather exercise
    His mercy in grace than exhibit His might in wrath.

# 359. Seven Resurrections

1.  THE **persons** whom Christ raised as shewing forth His power
    (Matthew 11:5).
2.  **Christ’s** resurrection as manifesting His pre-eminence (1
    Corinthians 15:20).
3.  **Believer’s** resurrection with Christ, declaring our oneness with
    Him (Eph. 2:6).
4.  **Israel’s** national resurrection, or God’s purpose accomplished
    concerning them (Ez. 37:11-12).
5.  The resurrection of **Anti-Christ**, or the person that Satan shall
    raise (Rev. 17:8).
6.  The resurrection of the **bodies of believers** who have died (Jude
    9; Matt. 27:53; 1 Thess. 4:16; Rev. 6:9-12; 20:4).
7.  Resurrection of the **unsaved** (Rev. 20:5, 11-13).

# 360. Seven Spirits

REVELATION 4:5

WE have a sevenfold description of the power of the Holy Spirit in
Isaiah 11:2-3.

1.  “**The Spirit of Jehovah**” is the Holy Spirit in relation to God
    the Father, in His immutability and power resting upon Christ, to
    enable Him, as Man, to fulfil the offices of Prophet, Priest, and
    King. Thus, we have in this verse the three Persons of the Godhead.
2.  “**The Spirit of wisdom**” reminds us of the power that will enable
    Christ to act in a becoming *manner*, as when He rested upon the
    makers of the tabernacle, and directed them *how* to make the
    tabernacle (Exodus 31:3; 28:3; 35:30 to 36:2). Wisdom is the right
    application of knowledge.
3.  “**The Spirit of understanding.**” The Hebrew word translated here
    “understanding,” really means “Power to distinguish, so as to
    separate between good and evil.” The Holy Spirit had to chide the
    Hebrews because they were but children in the spiritual life, when
    they should have been full-grown (Heb. 5:14).
4.  “**The Spirit of counsel.**” That is, Christ has power to impart
    counsel, as well as being the Counselled One, for His name is
    “Counsellor” (Isaiah 9:6), and this, because as Man, the Holy Spirit
    counselled Him. Does He not intend to convey this truth to us in the
    words of John 10:15: “As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the
    Father, and I lay down My life for the sheep?” He thus acquaints His
    hearers with the fact that His knowledge of His Father’s holiness,
    justice, demands, love, grace, mercy, was a perfect knowledge; that
    He knew precisely what man needed, and He therefore “laid down His
    life for the sheep.” How very comforting and assuring to know this!
5.  “**The Spirit of might.**” Power characterized Christ’s words and
    work. His word was with authority (Luke 4:32), and His work was in
    power (Luke 4:36), even the power of the Holy Spirit, as He Himself
    confessed (Matt 12:28).
6.  “**The Spirit of knowledge.**” We have abundant evidence of Christ’s
    all-knowledge. He saw Nathaniel under the fig tree worshipping; and
    He knew the shallowness and unreality of certain who professed to
    believe on Him (John 1:48; 2:24-25).
7.  “**The Spirit of the fear of the Lord.**” “He was heard in that He
    feared” (Heb. 5:7), is the comment of the Holy Spirit, in relation
    to Christ’s action and attitude as Man in relation to God.

# 361. Seven Suppers

1.  **Sinners’ supper of pleasure.** “Herod…made a supper to his lords”
    (Mark 6:21).
2.  **Gospel supper.** “A certain man made a great supper” (Luke 14:16).
3.  **Entertaining the Master, the supper of communion.** “There they
    made Him a supper, and Martha served” (John 12:2).
4.  **Supper of love.** “When thou makest a supper” (Luke 14:12).
5.  **Marriage supper of the Lamb.** “Blessed are they which are called
    unto the marriage supper of the Lamb” (Rev. 19:9).
6.  **Supper of the Great God.** “Unto the supper of the Great God”
    (Rev. 19:17).
7.  **Supper of remembrance.** “To eat the Lord’s supper” (1 Corinthians
    11:20).

\




# 362. Seven Tables

1.  **Table of shittim wood.** “Thou shalt also make a table of shittim
    wood” (Ex. 25:23).
2.  **Anointed table.** “Thou shalt anoint……the table” (Exodus 30:26).
3.  **Holy table.** “Upon the pure table before the Lord” (Leviticus
    24:6).

    (Leviticus 24:8).
5.  **Prepared table.** “Thou preparest a table before me” (Psalm 23:5).
6.  **The King’s table.** “While the King sitteth at His table” (Song of
    Solomon 1:12).
7.  **The Lord’s table.** “Be partakers of the Lord’s table” (1
    Corinthians 10:21).

\

6.  **The that of ability.** “Now unto Him *that* is able to do”
    (Ephesians 3:20).
7.  **The that of almightiness.** “Exceeding abundantly above all *that*
    we ask or think” (Ephesians 3:20).

# 364. Seven Things It Pleased God to Do

    His people” (1 Sam. 12:22).
6.  **To make us one in Christ.** “Set the members everyone of them in
    the Body as it hath *pleased* Him” (1 Cor. 12:18).
7.  **To give us a resurrection body.** “God giveth it a body as it hath
    *pleased* Him” (1 Cor. 15:38).

2.  **Instructs the mind.** “Making wise the simple” (Psalm 19:7).

    19:10).

# 367. Seven Times the Words, “In the Lord,” Occur in Ephesians

1.  **Faith in the Lord Jesus.** “Faith *in the Lord* Jesus” (Eph.
    1:15).

    6:21).

# 368. Seven Times Christ Is Said to Speak to His Father

    Father . . . . even so, Father” (Matt. 11:25-26).
2.  **At the raising of Lazarus.** “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast

# 370. Shadow

“I SAT DOWN UNDER HIS SHADOW” (CANT. 2:3).

THE shadow, when used in connection with God, represents what He is to
His people.

1.  **Place of protection.** “Hide me under the *shadow* of Thy wings”
    (Psalm 17:8).
2.  **Place of confidence.** “The children of men put their trust under
    the *shadow* of Thy wings” (Psalm 36:7).
3.  **Place of refuge.** “In the *shadow* of Thy wings will I make my
    refuge” (Psalm 57:1).

    heavy for me” (Psalm 38:4).
3.  **Over us is a tyrannical master.** “Ye were the servants of sin”
    (Rom. 6:17).

    4:7).
5.  **Beside us is a sure detective.** “Be sure your sin will find you
    out” (Num. 32:23).
6.  **Beyond us is an accusing witness.** “Some men’s sins….going before

    Tim. 5:24).

\




# 372. Sin

IT is an axiom in science, that for every effect there must be an
adequate cause. Thus sins committed, have their cause in heart
corruption. The heart is diseased, therefore the life is wrong (Matt.
15:19). The fountain is foul, therefore the stream is impure (James
3:11). Insanity is enthroned in the mind, therefore madness rules the
man’s actions (Eccles. 9:3). As a bad liver paints its owner’s face with
a yellow hue, so sin within, is the cause of the black colour in the
life of man (Rom. 3:12). As the engine moves the screw which moves the
steamer, so sin is the moving cause of all the sinful acts in the life
(Rom. 7:15). As when the regulator in the watch is wrongly set, the
watch will be wrong; so long as the heart is wrong, the man is wrong
(Jer. 17:9). As everything in nature brings forth “after his kind” (Gen.
1:12), so sin, being within (Rom. 7:18), like a smouldering fire, it
will burst forth into flame in the life. Heart corruption is the cause
of all corruption. As salt in meat, or leaven in meal, will permeate the
whole; so sin in the heart gives a heart to sin, which makes it beat in
wickedness and rebellion against God.

1.  **Sin inherited.** As the heir in an entailed estate inherits the
    estate after the decease of his parent, so we have inherited the
    estate of sinfulness which Adam acquired by his disobedience (Rom.
    5:12).
2.  **Sin colouring.** As the negro inherits his black skin from his
    parents, so we have inherited the black nature of sin (John 3:6;
    Jeremiah 13:23).
3.  **Sin transmitted.** As the law of heredity proves that the parent’s
    sin can be transmitted to the child, so the Scriptures declare Adam
    has passed on to us the evil of sin (Rom. 5:12).
4.  **Sin tainting.** As the insane person owes, very often, his
    insanity to his ancestors, from whom he received the taint of
    madness, so the madness of sin has been bequeathed to us (Psalm
    14:3).
5.  **Sin embittering.** As it is the nature of a crab-apple tree to
    transmit its sourness to its fruit, so the sourness of iniquity is
    an inherited quality (Psalm 51:5).
6.  **Sin stinging.** As it is the nature of a nettle to sting, because
    it is the fac-simile of its parent, so it is the nature of a sinner
    to sin (Rom. 8:7)
7.  **Sin reproducing.** As the child is like its parents in the face,
    so we show our relationship to Adam by our sins (Eph. 2:3).

\




# 373. Sin

LEPROSY illustrates the loathsomeness of sin, consumption the
deceitfulness of sin, palsy shows the helplessness of the sinner when in
the power of sin.

1.  **Blindness.** Sin has blinded the eyes of man’s understanding so
    that he cannot see the danger he is in (2 Cor. 4:4), nor the beauty
    there is in Christ (Isaiah 53:2).
2.  **Deafness.** Sin has deafened man’s hearing, so that he cannot hear
    God calling him (Mark 8:18).
3.  **Defilement.** Sin has defiled man’s mind and polluted his
    imagination, so that he cannot appreciate Divine things (Gen. 6:5).
4.  **Corrupting.** Sin has corrupted man’s heart, so that he has no
    love for God, and no desire for the things of God (Gen. 6:12).
5.  **Paralysis.** Sin has paralysed man’s will, so that he has no power
    to raise himself from the helpless position he is in, and no moral
    force to enable him to walk in the ways of God (Rom. 5:6).
6.  **Separation.** Sin has separated man’s soul from God (Isaiah 59:2),
    so that he is “dead in sins” (Eph. 2:1).
7.  **Rebellion.** Sin has filled man’s mind with rebellion, so that he
    is said to be “carnal” and “enmity against God” (Rom. 8:7).

\




# 374. Sin

GENESIS iii

As the River Forth can be seen winding its way towards Edinburgh from
Stirling, so we see the course of sin in the chapter before us.

1.  **Sin is often a pleasant thing in contemplation** (Gen. 3:6). Sodom
    apples are pleasant to look upon, but a mouthful of dust is the
    outcome of tasting. The bait is caught at, as a desirable morsel by
    the fish, but the hook is there as well. The food in the trap is
    tempting to the bird, but the prison-cage comes afterwards.
2.  **Sin is disobedience** (Rom. 5:19). There is no mention of Eve
    taking an apple, as is often said. The sin was disobedience to God’s
    command. The meaning of the word transgression is “to go beyond the
    command of God,” as the schoolboy, who goes beyond the boundary
    prescribed by the schoolmaster.
3.  **Sin is prolific.** One sin leads to another. As the one thistle
    will produce many thistle seeds, so one sin begets many others. Eve
    was led to lust with her eyes, and following in the train came the
    lust of the flesh and the pride of life.
4.  **Sin is the knowledge of evil** (Gen. 3:5). Knowledge is good when
    it leads us to know God, for to know Him is to trust Him (Psalm
    9:10), but knowledge is evil when it enables the sinner to sin in a
    more clever way, and when it is purchased at the price of
    punishment, as the boy found when he was sent to gaol for stealing
    the apples, although he only wanted to know how they tasted.
5.  **Sin is contagious.** “And gave” (Gen. 3:6). As the feverstricken
    patient will communicate the disease by shaking the hand of another,
    so the sinner spreads a pestilence by his actions.
6.  **Sin is optional.** Satan did not force Eve to sin; she was enticed
    by him (1 Tim. 2:14), and she in turn enticed Adam, and “he did eat”
    (Gen. 3:6), but in each case it was a voluntary action.
7.  **Sin involves others** (Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor. 15:22). No one lives to
    himself, everyone is exerting an influence either for good or evil.
    Many a man owes his taste for the drink to his drinking father or
    mother.
8.  **Sin brings shame** (Gen. 3:7). Moral nakedness (Rev. 3:17) and a
    conscious unfitness for God’s presence is the cause of shame. A
    naked soul is a Christless soul, for He alone is the garment of
    salvation (Isaiah 61:10).
9.  **Sin brings fear** (Gen. 3:10). Conscience makes cowards of us all.
    But how did man obtain a conscience? By sin. It is consciousness of
    coming judgment that fills the sinner with dread, even as the
    terrified animals flee before the prairie fire.
10. **Sin brings punishment** (Gen. 3:14-19). By the very necessity of
    His own nature God must punish sin. He can by no means clear the
    guilty. No man can break the law of nature without being punished;
    even so with the law of God, and the command to repent and believe
    in Christ.

# 375. Sin and Grace

II. CHRONICLES 15:1-10

THE glowing bow of God’s grace is seen in the dark cloud of the people’s
sin.

1.  **A gracious message** (2Chron. 15:1-2). The message promises that
    if the people will side with the Lord, the Lord will side with them
    (see Luke 9:50).
2.  **A grievous case** (2Chron. 15:3). It was sad to be without God,
    without law, and without instruction; but the unsaved are in a worse
    plight. They have
    -   No God (Ephesians 2:12).
    -   No Christ (Ephesians 2:12).
    -   No light (Ephesians 4:18; 5:8).
    -   No life (1 John 5:12).
    -   No peace (Isaiah 57:21).
    -   No liberty (Colossians 1:13).
    -   No hope (Ephesians 2:12).

3.  **A good find** (2Chron. 15:4). To find the Lord is to find all
    good, as the prodigal found when he came home to his father. To find
    the Lord is to be found of the Lord (Luke 15:5-7, 8-10).
4.  **A gloomy country** (2Chron. 15:5-6). When men get wrong with God,
    they are sure to fall out with each other. Gloom is the daughter of
    godlessness.
5.  **A grand promise** (2Chron. 15:7). An honest heart is the one
    essential for the seed of God’s truth to bring forth fruit (Matt.
    13:23), and diligence is the forerunner of blessing. Work and reward
    go together.
6.  **A genuine revival** (2Chron. 15:8). There are always two sides to
    a genuine revival, namely the *negative* side-the “putting away” (1
    Peter 2:1, R.V.), and the *positive* side-renewing “the altar of the
    Lord” (2Chron. 15:8).
7.  **A gathered host** (2Chron. 15:9-10). When men get near to God,
    they get near to each other. The true basis of union is found in
    gathering around the True Centre-Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).

# 376. Sin—Its Extent and Nature

SIN cannot be estimated by our consciousness (Num. 15:27-30). “Though he
wist it not, yet is he guilty” (Lev. 5:17).

What is sin? The Holy Spirit has given us a sevenfold answer to the
question.

1.  “**Sin is lawlessness**,” namely, self-will (1 John 3:4, R.V.). King
    Saul is an example (1 Sam. 15:23).
2.  “**All unrighteousness is sin**” (1 John 5:17). Unrighteousness is
    crookedness. Balaam is an illustration (Jude 11).
3.  “**Whatsoever is not of faith is sin**” (Rom. 14:23). Cain
    illustrates this (Heb 11:4, 6).
4.  “**The thought**” (**device**) “**of foolishness is sin**” (Prov.
    24:9). Korah is an example (Num. 16:1-3).
5.  “**The plowing of the wicked is sin**” (Prov. 21:4). Sin sums up the
    whole life of the godless man.
6.  “**To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is
    sin**” (James 4:17). Failure to do right is as much sin as doing
    wrong. Eli (1 Sam. 3:13).
7.  “**Of sin because they believe not on Me**” (John 16:9). Unbelief is
    the mother of all sin. Eve believed the devil’s lie, and thus
    disbelieved God, and fell in consequence (Gen. 3:1-6).

Man naturally, is the embodiment of sin, hence he cannot please God
(Rom. 8:8), therefore all he does while in the state of nature is sin in
the sight of God. Man may not believe this of himself, but it is none
the less true, although not known. Job thought he was fairly good till
he came into the clear shining of the Lord’s presence, then he saw
himself, and turned with loathing from the sight (Job 42:5-6).
# 377. Snares

THERE are two things the child of God ever needs to remember, and these
are, that he has a wise Keeper, and that he has a wily enemy, and this
wily enemy is always on the look-out to entangle us in the meshes of his
snares.

1.  **The snare of pride.** “The *snare* of the devil” (1 Tim. 3:7). The
    snare in which Satan entangled himself to his own downfall was pride
    (Ezekiel 28:1-9). Beware of this gin. It has many colours and
    shapes.
2.  **The snare of riches.** “They that will be rich fall into
    temptation, and a *snare*” (1 Tim. 6:9). Glittering gold is a snare
    that has fascinated many to their overthrow and destruction (Acts
    5:1-9).
3.  **The snare of sleepiness.** “Awake (margin) themselves out of the
    *snare* of the devil” (2 Tim. 2:26). Strife will stir up the old
    man, but it will put the better man to sleep.
4.  **The snare of idolatry.** “Gideon made an ephod…which thing became
    a *snare* unto Gideon, and to his house” (Judges 8:27). Idolatry is
    committed when anything or anyone is put in the place of God.
5.  **The snare of faltering.** “Thine eye shall have no pity upon them,
    neither shalt thou serve their gods, for that will be a *snare* unto
    thee” (Deut. 7:16).
6.  **The snare of fear.** “The fear of man bringeth a *snare*” (Prov.
    29:25). If we fear God, we need fear no one else, be he man or
    devil.
7.  **The snare of evil companionship.** “They shall be *snares* and
    traps unto you” (Joshua 23:13). The breath of the world will tarnish
    and infect us in our spiritual life.

# 380. State of the Sinner

THE state of the natural man is deplorable in the sight of God (Psalm
14). The following are a few of the characteristics of the one who lacks
the life of God.

1.  **Carnal state.** “The carnal mind is enmity against God” (Romans
    8:7).
2.  **Deceitful state.** “The heart is deceitful” (Jer. 17:9).
3.  **Unrighteous state.** “None righteous” (Rom. 3:10).
4.  **Lifeless state.** “Dead in trespasses and sins” (Eph. 2:1).
5.  **Godless state.** “Without God” (Eph. 2:12).
6.  **Christless state.** “Without Christ” (Eph. 2:12).
7.  **Darkened state.** “Darkness” (Eph. 4:18; 5:8).
8.  **Enslaved state.** “Servants of sin” (Rom. 6:17).

12. **Guilty state.** “Guilty before God” (Rom. 3:19).
13. **Condemned state.** “Condemned already” (John 3:18).

# 381. Stars

STARS may be taken to represent believers. In the following passages of
Holy Writ a resemblance will be found between the two.

1.  **Made.** “He made the stars also” (Gen. 1:16). “Created in Christ
    Jesus” (Eph. 2:10).
2.  **Sealed.** “Sealeth up the stars” (Job 9:7). “Sealed with that Holy
    Spirit of promise” (Eph. 1:13).
3.  **Exalted.** “Behold the height of the stars” (Job 22:12). “Made us
    sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Eph. 2:6).
4.  **Not pure.** “The stars are not pure in His sight” (Job 25:5). “If
    we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves” (1 John 1:8).
5.  **Ordained.** “The stars, which Thou hast ordained” (Ps. 8:3). “I
    have chosen you, and ordained you,” &c. (John 15:16).
6.  **To rule.** “The stars to rule by night” (Psalm 136:9). “He that
    overcometh…will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule
    them with a rod of iron” (Rev. 2:26-27).
7.  **Numbered.** “He telleth the number of the stars” (Ps. 147:4). “The
    Lord knoweth them that are His” (2 Tim. 2:19).
8.  **Called.** “He calleth them all by their names” (Ps. 147:4). “He
    calleth His own sheep by name” (John 10:3).
9.  **Praising.** “Praise Him, all ye stars of light” (Ps. 148:3). “To
    the praise of the glory of His grace” (Eph. 1:6).
10. **Light-givers.** “The stars for a light by night” (Jer. 31:35). “Ye
    are the light of the world” (Matt. 5:14).
11. **Differing.** “One star differeth from another star in glory” (1
    Corinthians 15:41). “Diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” (1
    Corinthians 12:4).
12. **Held.** “He had in His right hand seven stars” (Rev. 1:16). “My
    sheep….shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of
    My hand” (John 10:27-28).

# 382. Steps in the Christian Life

THERE are some terms that relate to the Christian life which are of
pressing importance, because of the issues involved in relation to them.
The following seven words indicate a few aspects of the Christian’s
life, namely, “Believe,” “Pray,” “Abide,” “Walk,” “Take,” “Stand,”
“Watch.”

1.  **To believe on Christ** is the **secret** of the Christian life
    (Galatians 2:20).
2.  **To pray to Christ** is the **stay** of the Christian life (Phil.
    4:6).
3.  **To abide in Christ** is the **strength** of the Christian life
    (John 15:4).
4.  **To walk as Christ** is the **shining out** of the Christian life
    (1 Peter 2:21).
5.  **To take from Christ** is the **supply** of the Christian life
    (Isaiah 27:5).
6.  **To stand with Christ** is the **staple** of the Christian life
    (Ephesians 6:14).
7.  **To watch for Christ** is the **standing order** of the Christian
    life (Mark 13:33). The term watchfulness is a comprehensive one. It
    signifies far more than merely holding the truth of the Lord’s
    coming. It covers the whole trend of the spiritual life in the
    variety of its traits.


# 383. Steps in True Consecration

II. CHRONICLES xvii

THE right attitude of the soul to the Lord is the secret of true
consecration.

1.  **Companioning with the Lord** (2Chron. 17:3). The Lord was with
    Jehoshaphat, because he was with the Lord by obedience to His word.
    To be is to have.
2.  **Directing to the Lord** (2Chron. 17:4). As the ship will be kept
    on its right course as the helmsman is guided by the compass, so the
    believer will be right in life as he directs his way by the written
    word of the living God.
3.  **Blessing from the Lord** (2Chron. 17:5). The way of Jehoshaphat
    was stablished, because he was stedfast, for the time being, in the
    way of the Lord. If we are faithful to the Lord by obeying His word,
    He will be faithful to us in giving us His blessing.
4.  **Encouraged in the Lord** (2Chron. 17:6). The king was encouraged
    (margin) in the ways of the Lord by the Lord’s blessing. There is no
    fear of the Lord’s blessing; the only fear is, lest we should fail
    to fear the Lord who blesses.
5.  **Word of the Lord** (2Chron. 17:9). To teach the Word of the Lord
    is to impart the greatest blessing upon mankind. See Ps. 19:7-11 as
    to what the Word of God is and does.
6.  **Power through the Lord** (2Chron. 17: 10). The greatest influence
    that any man can exert, is the influence that comes from the
    presence of God with him.
7.  **Offering unto the Lord** (2Chron. 17:16). To give ourselves to the
    Lord, and to allow ourselves to remain in His hands, is the very
    essence of consecration (Rom. 6:13; 12:1).

# 384. “Steps of Faith”

GENESIS 12:1-9

1.  **The Beginning of Faith.** “The Lord had said” (Gen. 12:1). Faith
    has no existence apart from revelation. *Nature* is a revelation of
    God’s handiwork. *Christ* is God manifest in the flesh. The *Written
    Word* is the unfolding of Christ the Living Word; and by that Word,
    heard as the voice of God, faith is begotten in the soul, for faith
    cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17).
2.  **The Call of Faith.** “Get thee out,” &c. (Gen. 12:1). Abram is
    called to separate himself from his country and kindred. It was no
    light task, but faith is always obedient (Hebrews 11:8). The same
    principle applies to the believer in Christ. Christ says we must be
    willing to leave all to follow Him, and no earthly relation must
    hinder. See the three “*Cannots*” in Luke 14:26-33.
3.  **The Promise of Faith.** See the four “*I wills*” in Gen. 12:1-2,
    and 3. When the Lord says, “I will,” it means that He gives the
    power to perform. His “I will” is the name to the cheque that is
    honoured at Heaven’s bank. The “Thou shalt” of the Law only brought
    consternation and condemnation, but the “I will” of grace always
    brings consecration and consolation to faith.
4.  **The Blessing of Faith.** “Be thou a blessing” (Gen. 12:2, R.V.).
    Faith having received the promise of God, and thus being blessed by
    God, is now responsible to be a blessing. Notice the Revised Version
    gives the more correct reading. Every blessing and privilege of
    grace brings a corresponding responsibility. Having received, we are
    to give (John 6:11). Having heard, we are to tell (John 4:29; 1 John
    1:3). Having found, we are to find (John 1:45).
5.  **The Obedience of Faith.** “Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken”
    (Gen. 12:4). It was enough for Abram that he had God’s command to
    leave his kin and country; so to faith it is sufficient that the
    Lord speaks for it to act. From reason’s standpoint it was a foolish
    thing for Abram to leave home not knowing where he was going (Heb.
    11:8), but it was enough for him that God had said, “I will shew
    thee” (Gen. 12:1). Surely it is better to walk with God in the dark
    than go by ourselves in the light? Faith says, “Yes,” and acts
    accordingly.
6.  **The Concern of Faith.** “Abram took,” &c. (Gen. 12:5). Abram did
    not leave his family behind him, but took them with him. Faith is
    ever concerned about the welfare of others. It is never content to
    be blessed alone. “Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great
    things the Lord hath done for thee” (Mark 5:19) is the Lord’s word
    to faith-faith never hesitates to respond, for the evidence of faith
    in Christ is seen in its concern for the welfare of others, as
    illustrated in the case of the saints at Thessalonica, who, having
    “turned to God,” were “ensamples” to others, and who, having
    “received the Word,” “sounded the word out” to their neighbours (1
    Thess. 1:6-9).
7.  **The Enemy of Faith.** “The Canaanite was then in the land” (Gen.
    12:6). The Canaanite would probably dispute Abram’s right to be in
    the land; and there are those who question the believer’s walk of
    faith. Self says, “I would not.” Unbelief says, “I cannot.” Reason
    says, “I will not.” The world says, “It pays not.” Satan says, “Do
    not.” But faith says, “Why not?” By faith, God is my Father, Christ
    is my Saviour, the Holy Spirit is my Comforter, Holiness is my walk,
    Truth is my regulator, Saints are my companions, and Heaven is my
    home.
8.  **The Revelation of Faith.** “The Lord appeared unto Abram” (Gen.
    12:7). This was for Abram’s encouragement and strength. Trapp well
    says, “The sight of those wicked Canaanites might discourage him and
    unsettle his faith.” But then the sight of God relieved him; and the
    promise, “Unto thy seed will I give this land,” could not but put
    spirit into him, and make his good old heart to dance in his bosom.
    When the poor soul sinks sometimes at the sight of those Canaanites,
    and despairs almost of a conquest, God lets in a beam of His own
    light, and comforts it with some cordial promise, which is as Boaz
    was to Naomi, “A restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old
    age” (Ruth 4:15).
9.  **The Worship of Faith.** “There builded he an altar” (Gen. 12:7).
    The altar speaks of four things, namely, confession, atonement,
    communion, and worship. Three of the four things are related to
    worship. *Confession* of sin is the *prelude* to worship, for there
    can be no worship if there is sin on the conscience. *Atonement* is
    the *basis* of worship, for we can only worship God through the
    sacrifice of Christ (Heb. 10:19, 22; Eph. 2:18). *Communion* is
    *essential* to worship, for we can only worship the Lord as we have
    all things in common with Him; and worship itself is the heart
    boiling over with gratitude to Him for His love and mercy to us
    (Psalm 103:1-2).
10. **The Dwelling of Faith.** “His tent” (Gen. 12:8). The tent is the
    symbol of pilgrim life (Heb. 11:9), and a confession that Abram was
    looking for an abiding city (Heb. 11:10). In like manner the
    believer in Christ is a stranger and pilgrim (1 Peter 2:11). As a
    “stranger” he has no home in the world; that is, the world cannot
    satisfy him; and as a “pilgrim” he is passing through the world,
    that is, his aim and object are to please God in having no
    fellowship with the evil things in the world (1 John 2:16), as
    Bunyan’s pilgrims-Christian and Faithful-would not have anything to
    do with Vanity Fair, its goods or its occupants, and were persecuted
    in consequence.

# 385. Strength of the Lord

THE Lord gives a sevenfold strengthening to His people as they trust
Him.

1.  **The strength of His grace to empower.** “My grace is sufficient
    for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness” (2 Cor.
    12:9).
2.  **The strength of His arm to sustain.** “Fear thou not, for I am
    with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God, I will strengthen
    thee” (Isaiah 41:10).
3.  **The strength of His love to inspire.** “The love of Christ
    constraineth us” (2 Cor. 5:14).
4.  **The strength of His armour to protect.** “Be strong in the Lord,
    and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armour of God” (Eph.
    6:10-11).
5.  **The strength of His joy to gladden.** “The joy of the Lord is your
    strength” (Neh. 8:10).
6.  **The strength of His Word to comfort.** “This is my comfort in my
    affliction, for Thy Word hath quickened me” (Psalm 119:50).
7.  **The strength of His power to qualify.** “Ye shall receive power,
    after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be
    witnesses unto Me” (Acts 1:8).

# 386. Strong Drink

ISAIAH 5:11-14

THERE are seven things which are said in relation to “strong drink” and
the man who swallows it.

1.  **Strong drink fascinates.** Strong drink is the first thing in the
    morning and the last thing at night that the man follows who is
    under its spell. As when one is fascinated by a deadly serpent and
    is spell-bound to destruction, so those who are under the attraction
    of the demon drink find themselves enchanted to their destruction.
2.  **Strong drink inflames.** “Till wine inflame them” (Isa. 5:11). As
    a fever will inflame the body, causing the pulse to throb with
    unnatural rapidity, and the temperature to rise till it seems that
    the body will be consumed, so the drink will create a burning which
    eats out the very life of its victim.
3.  **Strong drink obliterates.** “They regard not” (Isa. 5:12). As the
    continual use of a coin will in time efface the image of the
    sovereign upon it, so drink dulls and deadens the sensibility of the
    soul, till it becomes utterly indifferent to the claims and Being of
    God, and obliterates all desire for Him.
4.  **Strong drink dissipates.** “Neither consider the operation of His
    hands” (Isa. 5:12). As the sharp instrument plunged into the eye
    destroys the sight, so the drink eats away the optic nerve of the
    man’s inner nature till he cannot see the work and the working of
    God.
5.  **Strong drink captivates.** “Therefore My people are gone into
    captivity” (Isa. 5:13). As the spider will coil its web round the
    struggling fly till it has it completely in its power, so the drink
    will bind its victim till he is mastered, and the man is a helpless
    slave. Colonel Gardiner relates, that when he was considered by his
    military companions to be one of the most handsome and highly
    favoured of his day, he has seen a dog enter the mess-room, prowling
    for food, and looked at the creature with envy, inwardly groaning
    and exclaiming, “Oh that I were that dog.” Many a helpless slave of
    drink has had a similar desire.
6.  **Strong drink enervates.** “Their honourable men are famished, and
    their multitude dried up with thirst” (Isa. 5:13). Instead of plenty
    there is famine. Instead of satisfaction there is thirst. As
    consumption wastes the sufferer till he becomes enervated, so drink
    spoils the powers of the drinker. The mind becomes enfeebled, the
    brain becomes muddled, the body becomes weak, the hand becomes
    shaky, the face becomes bleared, the home becomes wretched, and the
    pocket becomes empty. Adams well says, “The drunkard drowns all his
    substance at the ale-house, and though he devours much is the leaner
    every way. Drunkenness is a costly sin. It is like gunpowder-many a
    man is blown up by it. He throws his house so long out at windows
    till at last his house throws him out of doors.”
7.  **Strong drink compensates.** As the farmer expects to reap the same
    kind of corn that he sows, and more than he sows; so the drunkard
    shall reap what he sows (Gal. 6:8), and more than he sows (Isa.
    5:14). Baxter says, “Oh, what a sight it is to see a man go merry
    and laughing to damnation, and make a jest of his own undoing, to
    see him at the brink of hell and will not believe it, like a madman
    boasting of his wit, or a drunken man boasting of his sobriety, or
    as the swine is delighted when the butcher is shaving his throat to
    cut it, or as the fatted lambs are skipping in their pasture that
    to-morrow must be killed and eaten, or as the bird sits singing when
    the gun is levelled to kill him, or as the greedy fish run, striving
    which shall catch the bait, that must presently be snatched out of
    their element and lie dying on the bank.”

# 387. Substitution of Christ

THE Apostle Paul, in writing to the Church at Corinth, said, “I will
very gladly spend and be spent for you” (2 Cor. 12:15). The preposition
“huper,” translated “for,” is the one Paul uses, and is applied to
Christ as the One who was not only willing, but who did “spend” and was
“spent out” (2 Cor. 12:15, R.V., M.), in acting on our behalf.\* The
meaning of the word is bending over to protect, as a mother bird will
cover her young at the sacrifice of her own life; or service rendered on
behalf of another, thus acting in his stead, as when the priest offered
“sacrifices *for* sins” on behalf of another (Heb. 5:1). The following
will illustrate how faithfully and fully Christ acted on behalf of those
who believe in Him. The preposition “*huper*” occurs in each case, and
is rendered “*for*.”

**Christ as Giver.** “Given *for* you” (Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:24).

**Christ as Atoner.** “Shed *for* you” (Luke 22:20).

**Christ as the Bread.** “Bread…*for* the life of the world” (John
6:51).

**Christ as the Good Shepherd.** “Good Shepherd giveth His life *for*
the sheep (John 10:11).

**Christ as the Volunteer.** “I lay down My life *for* the sheep” (John
10:15).

**Christ as the Provision** for ungodly ones and sinners. “Christ died
*for* the ungodly” (Rom. 5:6); “Christ died *for* us” (Romans 5:8).

**Christ as the Passover.** “Christ our Passover, sacrificed *for* us”
(1 Cor. 5:7).

**Christ as the Fulfiller of Scripture.** “Christ died *for* our sins
according to the Scriptures” (1 Cor. 15:3).

**Christ as the Sin-bearer.** “He hath made Him to be sin *for* us” (2
Corinthians 5:21).

**Christ as the Deliverer.** “Gave Himself *for* our sins, that He might
deliver” (Gal. 1:4).

**Christ as the Substitute.** “Gave Himself *for* me” (Gal. 2:20).

**Christ as the Curse-bearer.** “Made a curse *for* us” (Gal. 3:13).

**Christ as the Burnt-offering.** “Himself *for* us, an offering and a
sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour” (Eph. 5:2).

**Christ as the Lover.** “Loved….gave Himself *for* it” (Eph. 5:25).

**Christ as the Saviour.** “Salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who
died *for* us” (1 Thess. 5:10, R.V.).

**Christ as the Ransom.** “A Ransom *for* all” (1 Tim. 2:6).

**Christ as the Redeemer.** “Gave Himself *for* us, that He might redeem
us,” &c. (Titus 2:14).

**Christ as the Kinsman.** “Taste death *for* every man” (Hebrews 2:9).

**Christ as the Sacrifice.** “Sacrifice *for* sins” (Heb. 10:12).

**Christ as the Sufferer.** “Suffered *for* us” (1 Peter 2:21).

**Christ as the Reconciler.** “ Just *for* the unjust, that He might
bring us to God” (1 Peter 3:18).

**Christ as the Example.** “Christ hath suffered *for* us….likewise,”
&c. (1 Peter 4:1).

**Christ as the Inspirer.** “He laid down His life *for* us, and we
ought,” &c. (1 John 3:16).

We have thus given in detail the principal Scriptures that speak of
Christ’s vicarious action, as it is of essential importance to be clear
upon this main fact, for to be wrong here is to be wrong at every point.

    unbelief” (Hebrews 3:12).
5.  **Standing.** “*Take heed* lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12).
6.  **Covetousness.** “*Take heed* and beware of covetousness” (Luke
    12:15).
7.  **Oneself.** “*Take heed* unto thyself” (1 Tim. 4:16).

\




# 390. Tactics of Satan

SIN was in the world before man. Satan is the originator of sin.
(Ezekiel 28:11-19, under the name of the King of Tyre, describes what
Satan was before he fell, and what he became by his iniquity.

Satan’s method and manner of working are displayed in the following
seven instances:—

1.  He puts evil into the hearts of men, as illustrated in the case of
    Ananias (Acts 5:3).
2.  He endeavours to keep men from that which is of God, as seen in the
    instance of Joshua (Zech. 3:1).
3.  He catches away the seed of God’s truth, lest man should be
    benefited (Matt. 13:19).
4.  He blinds men to their true condition and the beauty of Christ (2
    Corinthians 4:4).
5.  He hinders the servants of Christ in the work of the Gospel (1
    Thess. 2:18).
6.  He tries to lead men into sin, as is portrayed in the temptation of
    Christ (Matt. 4:1-11).
7.  His aim is to get men to discredit the word of God, as may be
    gathered from the temptation of Eve (Gen. 3:1-5).

\




# 391. “Ten Men with One Cry”

THERE are ten men in the Scriptures who have one cry. The cry is, “I
have sinned.” But how differently they utter this confession.

1.  **The cry of hardened Pharaoh,** as he is smarting under the
    judgment of God, but yet goes on in his rebellious way (Exodus 9:27;
    10:16).
2.  **The cry of covetous Baalam,** as he confesses to the angel (Num.
    22:34), but still clings to the wages of unrighteousness.
3.  **The cry of discovered and deceitful Achan,** as he confesses his
    iniquity to Joshua (Jos. 7:20), but who would not have said anything
    if he had not been found out.
4.  **The cry of reckless and rebellious King Saul,** as he finds His
    sin is discovered (1 Sam. 15:24, 30).
5.  **The cry of convicted David,** when his sin is revealed to him by
    Nathan (2 Sam. 12:13).
6.  **The cry of persecuting but penitent Shimei,** as he acknowledges
    his wrong-doing to David (2 Sam. 19:20).
7.  **The cry of chastened and yet chafing Job,** as he is smarting
    under his affliction (Job 7:20).
8.  **The cry of humbled Micah,** as he judges himself before the Lord
    (Micah 7:9).
9.  **The cry of traitorous Judas,** as he beholds the result of his
    unholy act (Matthew 27:4).
10. **The cry of the convicted and comfortless prodigal,** as he returns
    to his father’s house (Luke 15:21).

# 392. The Agony in Gethsemane

MARK 14:32-42

“IT has been said by a great poet that great characters and great souls
are like mountains-they always attract storms; upon their heads break
the thunders, and around their bare tops flash the lightnings and the
seeming wrath of God. Nevertheless, they form a shelter for the plains
beneath them. This marvellous saying finds an illustration in the
lowliest, saddest soul the world has ever had living in it-the Lord
Jesus Christ. Higher than all men, around His head seemed to beat the
very storms of sin; yet beneath the shelter of His great, consoling,
sustaining spirit, what lowly people, what humble souls, what poor babes
as to wisdom, what sucklings as to the world’s truth, have gained their
life in this world and eternal rest in God.” It is because Christ has
passed through the valley of the shadow of death and the vale of
suffering that He is able to succour and comfort His own in similar
circumstances (Psalm 23:4; Heb. 2:10). There are some spots on earth
which are memorable because of the scenes that have been enacted upon
them, or because of some personal association with them. Bethel was a
place that was dear to Jacob, for it was there that God revealed Himself
to him. In like manner Gethsemane is a spot that is ever green in the
memory of the child of God, for there the Saviour poured out His soul in
strong crying and tears (Heb. 5:7), and sweat, in intense agony, great
drops of blood (Luke 22:44).

1.  **The Praying Man** (Mark 14:32). One aspect of the life of Christ
    is, that His life was a life of prayer. From His first appearance in
    public at His baptism (Luke 3:21) till the end of His career on the
    cross (Luke 23:46) He was a Man of Prayer. It is a profitable study
    to mark in the Gospel according to Luke how often Christ is found in
    the act of praying.
2.  **The Amazed Redeemer** (Mark 14:33). Mark alone tells us that
    Christ was “sore amazed.” The same term is rendered “greatly amazed”
    in referring to the people who came running to Christ when He came
    down from the mount of transfiguration (Mark 9:15), and the word is
    translated “affrighted” in speaking of the women’s fright at the
    sepulchre when they saw the young man in a white garment inside
    (Mark 16:5-6). What was the sight that affrighted Christ? Could it
    be that He had a sight of the evil of sin, the baseness of iniquity,
    and the awful punishment man’s disobedience merited? Or did He see
    the “*cup*” He was to drink (Psalm 75:8), the “*sin*” that He was to
    be made (2 Cor. 5:21), the “*curse*” He was to be accounted (Gal.
    3:13), the “*sword*” that was to pierce Him (Zech. 13:7), the
    “*horrible pit*” into which He was to be cast (Psalm 40:2), the
    “*iniquities*” which were to be laid upon Him (Isaiah 53:6), and the
    “*stripes*” He was to receive? (Isaiah 53:5).
3.  **The Sorrowful Christ** (Mark 14:34). Matthew says, He “began to be
    sorrowful” (Matt. 26:37); Luke says He was in “an agony” (Luke
    22:44); and Mark says He was “sore amazed,” (“very heavy,” and
    “exceeding sorrowful unto death.” The pangs of hell got hold of Him,
    and the sorrows of death compassed Him.
4.  **The Persistent Pleader** (Mark 14:35-39). Christ used the “same
    words” in His importunate pleading. It was no mere repetition with
    Him, but a holy clinging to His Father to be released, if possible,
    from the fiery ordeal through which He was about to pass.
5.  **The Acquiescing Son** (Mark 14:36). “Not what I will” was the
    key-note of the life of Christ (John 4:34).

If we would please God, and have untold and uninterrupted blessings,
like Christ, we must acquiesce in the will of God. Payson was asked,
when under great bodily suffering, if he could see any particular reason
for the dispensation. “No,” he replied, “but I am as well satisfied as
if I could see ten thousand; God’s will is the very perfection of all
reason.” Young McCall, of the Livingstone Congo Mission, when struck
down in the midst of his work, said, as his last words, “Lord, I gave
myself to Thee, body, mind, and soul. I consecrated my whole life and
being to Thy service; and now, if it please Thee to take myself, instead
of the work which I would do for Thee, what is that to me? ‘Thy will be
done.’”
# 393. The Ark

GENESIS vi

THERE are three thoughts in connection with the ark; salvation,
security, and supply.

1.  **Salvation.** The ark being made of wood is a type of the humanity
    of Christ (Heb. 2:7). The pitch with which the ark was covered is a
    type of the atonement of Christ. The ark would not have been able to
    keep out the waters of judgment, if it had not been pitched with
    pitch, so neither would the humanity of Christ save-He must die for
    us.\
     We are safe indeed, sheltered by the atonement of Christ. Here is
    an alphabet as to what the atonement of Christ does for those that
    believe in Him. It is the Anchor that will hold us eternally secure;
    the Balm that heals our wounded spirit; the Covering that makes us
    lovely in God’s sight; the Day-star to illuminate our soul; the
    Entrance into untold blessing; the Food that satisfies our longings;
    the Guarantee of eternal glory; the Harbour of Refuge for quietness;
    the Invincible argument against Satan to overcome him; the
    Joy-bringer of gladness and happiness; the Key to unlock the
    mysteries of heaven; the Liberator from all bondage; the Mainspring
    of a holy life; the Nutriment of our life; the Obliterator of our
    sins; the Pillow to rest on now, in death, and for ever; the
    Quickener to all that is of God; the Rest-giver to the conscience;
    the Saviour of our souls; the Tower that shelters; the Unburdener
    from all our cares; the Voice that prevails with God; the Warrant to
    heaven; and the Yoke that binds us for ever to Him.
2.  **Security.** “The Lord shut him in” (Gen. 7:16). In the ark was
    safety and security. How safe are we who are in Christ? As safe as
    Christ is. As the ark surrounded Noah and his family, so the Lord
    surrounds us.
3.  **Supply.** There was plenty of food in the ark (Gen. 6:21). Christ
    satisfies as well as saves.

\




# 394. The Believer in Relation to the Flesh

1.  **The flesh has been judged in Christ.** “Knowing this, that our old
    man is crucified with Him” (Rom. 6:6).
2.  **We have died to the flesh.** “They that are Christ’s have
    crucified the flesh” (Gal. 5:24).
3.  **We are not in the flesh.** “But ye are not in the flesh, but in
    the Spirit” (Rom. 8:9).
4.  **The flesh is in us.** “I know that in me (that is in my flesh)
    dwelleth no good thing” (Rom. 7:18).
5.  **The flesh is opposed to the new life.** “The flesh lusteth against
    the Spirit” (Gal. 5:17).
6.  **Make no provision for the flesh.** “Make not provision for the
    flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof” (Rom. 13:14).
7.  **Put no confidence in the flesh.** “Have no confidence in the
    flesh” (Phil. 3:3).

# 395. The Book of Genesis (Book of Absolute Facts)

A BOOK OF ABSOLUTE FACTS.

GENESIS means beginning. This book has been well called “the seed plot
of the Bible,” from the fact, that nearly every truth in the Word of God
is foreshadowed here.

There is no uncertain sound or hesitating manner in the language of this
book; we may say of it, as the people said of the Lord Jesus, “This
teaches with authority, not as others.” We can only notice a few of the
facts, and we would remind our readers that these notes are rather
suggestive than exhaustive.

*First fact*-“That God was before everything else.” “When did God have a
beginning?” asked a bright-faced little fellow of his Sunday-school
teacher one day. The teacher was lost for a minute or two for a reply,
when he suddenly exclaimed: “There must have been someone without a
beginning to make a beginning.” There are men who tell us that God
evolved from something, and began to be, but we ask who made the
something? We are content to believe in Jehovah, the One who always was,
who always is, and who always will be.

*Second fact*-“That God created-caused to be-all things.” The heavens
with their glory; the earth with its beauty; the sea in its majesty; the
animals in their variety; the birds with their song; the flowers in
their splendour; the fish in their plentitude; and man with his
intellect and powers.

*Third fact*-“That God made man in innocence.” There is a difference
between an innocent and a holy man. The innocent man is not conscious of
evil; the holy man is, and overcomes it. Our first parents were innocent
and pure. Without sin, but not beyond the possibility of sinning.

*Fourth fact*-“Sin was introduced into this world by Satan.” Then sin
was before our first parents fell? Yes. But it was through their
disobedience that we participate in it.

*Fifth fact*-“Sin has separated man from God.” The moment man sinned he
became dead Godward-that is, separated from God; and the whole human
family being represented in Adam, fell with him (Rom. 5:12, margin).

*Sixth fact*-“A Deliverer was foretold.” “The Seed ofthe woman shall
bruise his head.” This is not a promise given, but a fact stated.

*Seventh fact*-“That sin always brings punishment.” Look at our first
parents being driven out of the garden, the avenging waters of the
deluge, and the smoking ruins of Sodom, in confirmation of this. We must
be punished for our sins, or accept Him who has made perfect
satisfaction to God.
# 396. The Book of Genesis (Book of Typical Persons)

A BOOK OF TYPICAL PERSONS.

WHAT one has said of the whole Bible may well be applied to this book.

“This Book contains:—The mind of God, the state of man, the way of
salvation, the doom of sinners, and the happiness of believers. Its
doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its stories are true, and
its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe,
and practice it to be holy. It contains light to direct you, food to
support you, and comfort to cheer you. It is the traveller’s map, the
pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword, and the
Christian’s charter. Here Paradise is restored, heaven opened, and the
gates of hell disclosed.

### Christ is the Grand Object.

Our good its design, and the glory of God its end. It should fill the
memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet. Read it slowly, frequently,
prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, a Paradise of glory, a river of
pleasure. It is given you in life, will be opened at the judgment, and
be remembered for ever. It involves the highest responsibility, will
reward the labourer, and condemn all who trifle with its contents.”

But to come to the point before us. There are at least *nine* persons
who typify Christ in this book. *Adam*, the representative of the whole
human race, typical of Him who is the last Adam, the Lord from heaven.
*Abel*, the one who was accepted of God, typical of Him who offered
Himself to God, and glorified Him in His life and death, and in whom the
Father delighted. *Noah*, the obedient one, typical of Him whose meat it
was to do the will of Him who sent Him. *Enoch*, the pleasing one,
typical of Him of whom the Father said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased.” *Melchizedek*, the priestly king, typical of Him
who, like Melchizedek as to His priesthood, has no beginning and no end,
the ever-loving One. *Abraham*, the faithful one, typical of Him who is
the faithful and true One. *Isaac*, the peaceful one, typical of Him who
is the Prince of Peace, who has made peace by the blood of His Cross,
and who is now the Embodiment of peace-“He is our Peace.” *Jacob*, the
working one, typical of Him who laboured to secure His own, and this at
the sacrifice of Himself. *Joseph*, the royal one, typical of Him who is
yet to sit on His own throne. Although rejected now, He must reign in
spite of the malice and hatred of men, and the craft and subtlety of the
devil.

Further, there are seven persons who typify the believer-1, *Eve*, or
union with Christ; 2, *Seth*, or relationship to Him; 3, *Enoch*, or
walking with Him; 4, *Abram*, or obedience to Him; 5, *Lot*, or
backsliding from Him; 6, *Rebekah*, or loved by Him; 7, *Rachel*, or all
to Him.

*Again*, there are seven sets of persons:—

1.  Adam and Eve, or Christ and the Church.
2.  Cain and Abel, or faith and unbelief.
3.  Two Enochs, or worldliness and walking with God.
4.  Abram and Lot, or faithfulness and unfaithfulness.
5.  Sarah and Hagar, or the two covenants.
6.  Ishmael and Isaac, or the two natures.
7.  Jacob and Esau, or cunning and carelessness.

# 397. The Book of the Revelation

1.  **It is a book of stupendous facts.**\
     Facts referring to the Church, the Jew, Israel, the Gentiles,
    Satan, the beast, the false prophet, heaven, hell, time, and
    eternity.
2.  **It is a book of symbols.** Seals. Bowls. Trumpets.
3.  **It is a book telling of present and future judgment.**\
     Present judgment as brought out by Christ being in the midst of the
    churches, in the character in which He is seen; and future in
    relation to the world, antichrist, Satan, Rome, and corrupt
    Christianity.
4.  **It is a book of precious realities.**\
     See the “*I knows*,” and the “*I wills*” of Christ to the seven
    churches. Also the “*No mores*.”
5.  **It is a book full of Old Testament allusions.**\
     There are from 200 to 300 references and allusions to the Old
    Testament in this book. More than in any one Gospel or Epistle.
6.  **It is a peculiar book, if we contrast it with the Gospel and the
    Epistle of John.**\
     In the Gospel of John, we have Christ as the One in whom we
    believe; in the Epistle, the One whom we love; and in the
    Revelation, as the One we are waiting for.\
     In the Gospel we see Christ as the Apostle, *i.e.*, the sent One;
    in the Epistle, as our Advocate; and in the Revelation, as the
    King.\
     In the Gospel, it is His work on the Cross for us; in the Epistle,
    it is His work for us in heaven; in the Revelation, His work as
    Judge.\
     In the Gospel, we see Christ as the Word of God in creation and
    grace for us; in the Epistle, as the Word of Life manifested to us;
    and in the Revelation, as the Word of God in judgment.
7.  **It is a Book revealing Christ.**\
     We see Christ as the great High Priest judging the evil in the
    churches; as the Lamb on the Throne; as the Object of worship in
    heaven; as the Man of war overthrowing His enemies; as the Judge
    judging the wicked; as the Bridegroom of His church; and as the King
    reigning in righteousness.\
     “Revelation of Jesus Christ”-not of John. Revelation-the unfolding
    or unveiling the Lord and His purpose. Where did Christ get the
    Revelation? “From His Father.” What is its purpose? “To *show* unto
    His servants,” &c. To whom are these things made known? “His
    servants,” or, more correctly, His bond-slaves. It is the same word
    as in Rev. 6:15. “*Bondman*.”\
     When are these things to take place? “*Shortly*,” or speedily, same
    word as in Luke 18:8-“speedily.”

\




# 398. The Bridge of Sighs

THE Bridge of Sighs is the bridge which connects the Palace of the Doge
with the State prisons ot Venice. Over this bridge the State prisoners
were conveyed from the judgment-hall to the place of execution.

-   “I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs,
-   A palace and a prison on each hand.”

May we not say that the earthly life of the Lord Jesus was a Bridge of
Sighs, over which He passed, from the palace of the Father, to the death
of the cross? Verily it was. Three times in the New Testament we read of
the Lord Jesus sighing or groaning.

1.  **Christ sighed as He looked up to heaven in healing the deaf and
    dumb man** (Mark 7:34). He was grieved in heart, and groaned in
    spirit as He saw how sin had caused men to be deprived of their
    faculties. The term “*sighed*” is rendered “*groan*” in Romans 8:23,
    and 2 Cor. 5:2, 4; “*grief*” in Hebrews 13:17; and “*grudge*”
    (margin “*groan*”) in James 5:9. The meaning of the word “*stenazo*”
    is to sigh in sympathy, or to groan in distress. How this reminds us
    of the sympathy of Christ with suffering humanity.
2.  **Christ sighed deeply when the Pharisees in unbelief came and asked
    Him for a sign** (Mark 8:12). The expression that is used is even
    more forcible than the previous one, for it is the word “*stenazo*”
    with the prefix “*ana*,” which, together, means to fetch up a deep
    drawn sigh. Christ was greatly moved at the unbelief of the Jews. It
    made Him to be in bitterness of soul.
3.  **Christ groaned intensely when He saw Mary weeping after the death
    of Lazarus**, and as He listened to the questioning of the Jews
    respecting His power (John 11:33, 38). The margin of the Revised
    Version says, “He was moved with indignation in Himself.” The
    classical use of the expression is applied to the snort of a
    warhorse. Christ may have been moved with indignation when He saw
    the unbelief of the Jews, and as He listened to their questions; or
    He may have been deeply moved and agitated when He saw the ravages
    of sin, and longed to accomplish that death on the ground of which
    God should ultimately banish death (Rev. 20:14), and kill sorrow.

The groans of Christ in His life were but the forerunners of His
deeply-moving cry, when He cried out in heart anguish on the cross, “My
God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” Verily the sighs of Christ were
many on our account. We hear Him saying, “My sighs are many, and My
heart is faint” (Lam. 1:22).

\




# 399. The Cities of Refuge

HEBREWS 6:18 makes a distinct allusion to the Cities of Refuge, and the
man fleeing there for safety, as a type of Christ the Shelter for the
sinner. Let us look at the kind of Refuge which Christ is.

1.  Christ is a **Protecting Refuge.** Jehovah is said to be in Isaiah
    25:4, “A Refuge from the storm;” and in Psalm 59:16 the Psalmist
    says, “Thou hast been my Defence and Refuge in the day of my
    trouble.” As the man who had killed another inadvertently, found
    protection from the avenger of blood in the City of Refuge, so those
    who flee to Christ find protection from the wrath to come (1 Thess.
    1:10), from the curse of a broken law (Gal. 3:10), from the justice
    of God (Exodus 34:7), from the consequence of sin (Heb. 9:26), from
    the power of darkness (Col. 1:13), from the love of the world (Gal.
    1:4), and from the dominion of sin (Rom. 6:16), and find safety in
    the day of trouble.
2.  Christ is a **Pleasant Refuge.** 1 Joel 3:16 we read, “The Lord will
    be the Hope of His people,” or, as the margin gives it, “The place
    of repair, or harbour.” The Hebrew word rendered “*hope*” is the
    same as in the two previous passages of Scripture, where it is
    translated “*refuge*.” The marginal reading of “*harbour*” is
    suggestive of a pleasant harbour of refuge, such as is being built
    at the present at Peterhead and Sunderland. They are being built at
    great cost, to provide havens of rest for the storm-tossed mariners,
    where they can be in safety and calm. We can quite understand a
    sailor who has known the protection of one of these harbours
    regarding it as a pleasant place. But what is this in comparison
    with what Christ is? He is the Altogether Lovely (Cant. 5:16). Rest
    of conscience (Matthew 11:28), joy of heart (John 15:11),
    satisfaction of soul (Psalm 36:8), brightness of hope (1 Peter 1:3),
    gladness of spirit (John 20:20), preciousness of promise (2 Peter
    1:3), and pleasantness of peace (Prov. 3:17), are found in Him.
3.  Christ is a **Permanent Refuge.** “The Eternal God is thy refuge”
    (Deut. 33:27). The word “*refuge*” might be, and perhaps better,
    rendered “*habitation*.” The Lord is the Home of those who have fled
    to Him. The refugee was not to go out of his place of safety until
    the death of the high priest (Josh. 20:6). Our High Priest will
    never die, therefore with Him we shall live in the power of His
    endless life. It is in this sense that He “saves evermore” (Heb.
    7:25, margin). Those whom the Lord takes up He never gives up (John
    10:28-29). For “ever with the Lord” (1 Thess. 4:17), is the lock
    that shuts us into the glory and gladness of His presence for ever.
    Among the precious “no mores” of the Book of the Revelation is this
    one, “He shall go no more out” (Rev. 3:12).
4.  Christ is a **Personal Refuge.** More than once the Psalmist chants
    the words, “The Lord, He is my Refuge” (Psalm 91:2, 9). Well for us
    if we can sing-
    -   “Jesus, my heart’s dear Refuge;
    -   Jesus has died for me.”

    It is not enough to know that Christ is the Saviour we need, the
    essential thing is to make personal application to Him, and each to
    receive Him for oneself. The testimony of God’s saints is one on
    this point. Dr. Doddridge on his dying bed said, “I have no hope in
    what I have been or done, yet I am full of confidence, and this is
    my confidence, there is a Hope set before me. I have fled, I still
    fly for refuge to that Hope. In Him I trust, in Him I have strong
    consolation, and shall assuredly be accepted in this Beloved of my
    soul.” Having fled to Christ as the hiding place, the next thing is
    to make Him our abiding place, for as there is no safety out of
    Christ, neither is there joy if we are not abiding in Him by
    obedience to His Word; as Hewetson said, “I never have a moment’s
    peace when I return in the slightest degree to conformity with the
    world; but I always have great peace when my soul returns home to
    its City of Refuge, the Lord Jesus Christ. Communion with Christ is
    the only source of satisfaction, the only source of lasting
    enjoyment.”
    -   “Son of God. Thy Father’s treasure,
    -   He yet gives Thee all to me;
    -   Angels vainly toil to measure
    -   What I have in having Thee.
    -   Grace so vast bewilders Heaven;
    -   God to me His Christ has given.”


# 400. The Cries of Christ

1.  **The cry of the Witness.** “Jesus *cried* and said, He that
    believeth on Me believeth not on Me, but on Him that sent Me” (John
    12:44). Faithful in its testimony and full in its promise.
2.  **The cry of the Teacher.** “He *cried*, He that hath ears to hear,
    let him hear” (Luke 8:8). Powerful in utterance and practical in
    outcome.
3.  **The cry of the Life-giver.** “He *cried* with a loud voice,
    Lazarus, come forth” (John 11:43). Quickening and liberating.
4.  **The cry of the Satisfier.** “Jesus stood and *cried*, saying, If
    any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink” (John 7:37). Sure,
    lasting, refreshing and free.
5.  **The cry of the Rebuker.** “Then *cried* Jesus in the Temple as He
    taught, saying, ye both know Me,” &c. (John 7:28). Searching and
    mouth-stopping.
6.  **The cry of the Surrenderer.** “Jesus *crying* with a loud voice,
    said, Father into Thy hands,” &c. (Luke 23:46, R.V., M.). Patient
    and passive.
7.  **The cry of the Sufferer.** “Jesus *cried* with a loud voice
    saying, My God! My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?” (Matt. 27:46).
    Cry of Cries.

# 401. The Death of Christ

THE pith and power of the Gospel are the death and resurrection of
Christ. The former is its pith, and the latter is its power. The death
of Christ is-

1.  **Real as to its Occurrence.** “Christ that *died*” (Rom. 8:34).
    “Christ *died*” (Rom. 14:15; 1 Cor. 8:11). Towering o’er the wrecks
    of time, there is one fact that shines out in unmistakable reality,
    and that is, the death of Christ.
2.  **Substitutionary in its Character.** “Christ *died* for the
    ungodly,” “Christ *died* for us” (Rom. 5:6-8). Christ was acting on
    our behalf that He might protect us from the consequence of sin in
    dying in our stead.
3.  **Definite in its Work.** “He *died* unto sin once” (Rom. 6:10).
    “Christ *died* for our sins” (1 Cor. 15:3). His death had distinct
    relation to our sin. He died to bear away our *sins*, and to be
    judged for our *sin*.
4.  **Freeing in its Aim.** “He *died* for all, that they which live
    should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who *died*
    for them and rose again” (2 Cor. 5:15). In the death of Christ we
    have the magnet which draws us from self to Himself.
5.  **Practical in its Purpose.** “To this end Christ both *died*, and
    rose, and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and
    living” (Rom. 14:9). He died that He might gain us, and now we are
    His absolute property.
6.  **Assurance of Future Glory.** “Who *died* for us, that, whether we
    wake or sleep, we should live together with Him” (1 Thess. 5:10).
    The blood-red mark of Christ’s cross is stamped on every certificate
    of heaven.
7.  **Guarantee that our loved ones, who have fallen asleep, shall be
    with us in Christ’s coming glory.** “If we believe that Jesus *died*
    and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God
    bring with Him” (1 Thess. 4:14). There is one ray that shall make
    the golden glory of Christ’s splendour bear a rosy tint, and that is
    the red light of Calvary.

# 402. The Divine Helper

“THE Lord is my Helper” (Heb. 13:6).

1.  **Past Helper.** “Thou hast been my *Help*” (Psalm 63:7).
2.  **Present Helper.** “A very present *Help* in trouble” (Psalm 46:1).
3.  **Powerful Helper.** “I have laid *help* upon One that is mighty”
    (Psalm 89:19).
4.  **Protecting Helper.** “The Lord God will *help* me” (Isaiah 50:7,
    9).
5.  **Precious Helper.** “I will *help* thee” (Isaiah 41:10, 13-14).
6.  **Providing Helper.** “The *Helper* of the fatherless” (Psalm
    10:14).
7.  **Perpetual Helper.** “The God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
    heaven, in thy *help*” (Deut. 33:26).

# 403. The Eyes of the Lord

1.  **Seeing, to strengthen.** “The eyes of the Lord run to and fro
    throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong” (2 Chron. 16:9).
2.  **Seeing, to encourage.** “Before that Philip called thee, when thou
    wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee” (John 1:47-48).
3.  **Seeing, to direct.** “I will guide thee with Mine eye” (Psalm
    32:8).
4.  **Seeing, to deliver.** “Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them
    that fear Him…to deliver” (Psalm 33:18-19).
5.  **Seeing, to protect.** “The eyes of the Lord are upon the
    righteous” (Psalm 34:15).
6.  **Seeing, to discover.** “The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
    beholding the evil and the good” (Prov. 15:3).
7.  **Seeing, to preserve.** “The eyes of the Lord preserve him that
    hath knowledge” (Prov. 22:12, R.V.).
8.  **Seeing, to heal.** “He saw his wife’s mother laid…He touched her
    hand and the fever left her” (Matt. 8:14-15).
9.  **Seeing, to provide.** “When He saw the multitudes, He was moved
    with compassion on them” (Matt. 9:36).
10. **Seeing, to comfort.** “When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on
    her” (Luke 7:13; John 11:33, and 19:26).
11. **Seeing, to commend.** “He saw also a certain poor widow casting in
    thither two mites” (Luke 21:1-2).
12. **Seeing, to lament.** “When He was come near, He beheld the city,
    and wept over it” (Luke 19:41).

# 404. The Exclusiveness of “In Christ”

“1 Christ” is an exclusive expression, for a “man in Christ” is the
opposite to a man in the flesh. The apostle Paul, in an incidental way,
gives us the key to the cause of the difference in his life when he
refers to himself as a “man in Christ.” For one to be in the nation of
Israel meant, that he occupied a peculiar and separate position. Israel
as a people dwelt alone, and were not reckoned among the nations.

1.  **They were excluded from eating what they would.** “And these ye
    shall have in abomination,” &c. (Lev. 11:13-47). In like manner the
    believer in Christ is excluded from feeding upon the garbage of
    worldly novels, and the cunning treatises of men, who in the form of
    a story, propagate error. We have to feed upon the pure,
    unadulterated Word of God, and then we shall grow in the knowledge
    and grace of God.
2.  **They were excluded from wearing apparel of a mixed texture.**
    “Neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon
    thee” (Lev. 19:19; Num. 15:38). The believer in Christ is to put off
    all old habits formed in sin, and make no provision for the flesh to
    fulfil the desires thereof.
3.  **They were excluded from sowing their land with mixed seed.** “Thou
    shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds” (Deut. 22:9). Likewise
    in a spiritual sense the believer in Christ is excluded from mixing
    with the pure seed of the Word of God, the deductions and opinions
    of men, or the experiences that are in opposition to truth.
4.  **They were excluded from yoking clean and unclean animals in
    agricultural labour.** “Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass
    together” (Deut. 22:10). The believer in Christ must not yoke
    worldly methods with Divine principles. The popular theory among
    many of God’s people is, that the end justifies the means. The Lord
    did not think so when He shut Moses out of the land for striking the
    rock twice instead of speaking to it.
5.  **They were excluded from marrying any but Israelites.** “Neither
    shalt thou make marriages with them” (Deut. 7:3). The believer in
    Christ is strictly enjoined to “marry in the Lord,” and not to be
    “unequally yoked together with unbelievers” (1 Cor. 7:39; 2 Cor.
    6:14).
6.  **They were excluded from fellowship with the surrounding nations.**
    “I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people”
    (Lev. 20:24). The believer in Christ is separated to God as
    sanctified in Christ, and as saints, *i.e.*, God’s separated ones,
    we are to keep ourselves sacred to God.
7.  **They were excluded from acting in any way as they would.**
    “Therefore shall ye observe all My statutes, and all My judgments,
    and do them. I am the Lord” (Lev. 19:37). The believer in Christ
    right gladly does the will of Christ, for to be in the yoke of His
    will is to find rest and refreshment to the soul. It will be
    apprehended at once that to be in Christ means, that we are
    therefore excluded from the old sphere of sin and the world, and
    that we live a heavenly life, because we are a heavenly people. When
    Venice was in the hands of the Austrians, those alien tyrants
    swarmed in every quarter, but the Venetians hated them to the last
    degree, and showed their enmity upon all occasions. After this
    fashion will every true Christian treat his inbred sins; he will not
    be happy under their power, nor tolerate their dominion, nor show
    them favour. If he cannot expel them, he will not indulge them.

# 405. The Father's Sevenfold Gift to Christ

“THOU GAVEST ME.”

1.  **Completion.** “I have finished the work which *Thou gavest Me* to
    do” (John 17:4).
2.  **Manifestation.** “I have manifested Thy name unto the men which
    *Thou gavest Me* out of the world” (John 17:6).
3.  **Possession.** “Thine they were, and *Thou gavest* them *Me*” (John
    17:6).
4.  **Revelation.** “I have given unto them the words which *Thou gavest
    Me*” (John 17:8).
5.  **Preservation.** “Those that *Thou gavest Me* I have kept” (John
    17:12).
6.  **Identification.** “The glory which *Thou gavest Me* I have given
    them” (John 17:22).
7.  **Perfection.** “Of them which *Thou gavest Me* have I lost none”
    (John 18:9).


# 406. The Good Samaritan's Action in Regard to the Man Who Fell Among Thieves

THERE are many thoughts which are suggested if we take the Good
Samaritan as a type of Christ (Luke 10:30-37).

1.  **Condescension of the Good Samaritan.** “He came where he was”
    (Luke 10:33), unlike those who passed by on the other side. In like
    manner Christ came where we were. He came to our *humanity*, and
    took it upon Him (Heb. 2:14). He came to our *sorrow*, and became
    acquainted with it (Isaiah 53:4); He came to our *death*, and died
    it (1 Peter 3:18); He came to our *sin*, and bore it (2 Cor. 5:21);
    He came to our *curse*, and passed through it (Gal. 3:13); He came
    to our *woe*, and endured it (Heb. 12:2); and He came to our
    *lowness*, to lift us out of it (Phil. 2:8).
2.  **Compassion of the Good Samaritan.** “He had compassion on him”
    (Luke 10:33). Repeatedly we read of Christ being moved with
    compassion in His life, but the compassion of His compassion was,
    when He took pity upon us, as He saw us in our sin (Ezek. 16:8), and
    died on our account (Rom. 5:6, 8), for as David had compassion on
    Mephibosheth, and brought him to his own house (2 Sam. 9), so Christ
    has had compassion upon us, in dying to meet our need.
3.  **Care of the Good Samaritan.** There are seven things the Good
    Samaritan did for the man.
    1.  He “*went to him*.” He did not send a deputy to do his work. So
        with Christ. He saves (2 Tim. 1:9). He gives (John 14:27). He
        sustains (Isaiah 41:10). He accompanies (Ex. 33:14), and He
        keeps (Jude 24).
    2.  He “*bound up his wounds*.” So with Christ. He heals by His
        stripes (Isaiah 53:5), and comforts by His grace (2 Cor. 12:9).
    3.  He “*poured in oil and wine*.” So with Christ. He gives unction
        of His Spirit (1 John 2:27; 2 Cor. 1:21), and the wine of His
        joy (Psalm 104:15).
    4.  He “*set him on his own beast*.” In like manner, Christ gives us
        to sit in the place where He had been (Eph. 2:6).
    5.  He “*brought him to an inn*.” So Christ brings us to a place of
        safety (Isaiah 32:2), and into the banqueting house of His
        fellowship (Song of Solomon 2:4).
    6.  He “*took care of him*.” So with Christ. Those who are taken up
        by Him are not given up. They are in His mighty grip (John
        10:28), and cared for (1 Peter 5:7).
    7.  *He left supplies for the man*. “He took out two pence.” What a
        supply we have in Christ (Eph. 1:3; Phil. 4:19).


# 407. The Gospel

1.  **Divine Gospel.** “Separated unto the Gospel of God” (Romans 1:1).
2.  **Gracious Gospel.** “To testify the Gospel of the grace of God”
    (Acts 20:24).
3.  **Wondrous Gospel.** “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
    the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).
4.  **Life-giving Gospel.** “1 Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
    the Gospel” (1 Cor. 4:15).
5.  **Saving Gospel.** “The Gospel of your salvation” (Eph. 1:13).
6.  **Peace-securing Gospel.** “Your feet shod with the preparation of
    the Gospel of peace” (Eph. 6:15).
7.  **Full Gospel.** “I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the
    Gospel of Christ” (Rom. 15:29).
8.  **Powerful Gospel.** “I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for
    it is the power of God unto salvation” (Rom. 1:16).
9.  **Practical Gospel.** “Only let your conversation be as it becometh
    the Gospel of Christ” (Phil. 1:27).
10. **Glorious Gospel.** “Lest the light of the glorious Gospel of
    Christ” (2 Cor. 4:4).
11. **Everlasting Gospel.** “Having the everlasting Gospel to preach
    unto them” (Rev. 14:6).

\




# 408. The Gospel Proclaims

1.  **Pardon** for the guilty (Acts 26:18).
2.  **Peace** for the troubled (Eph. 2:17).
3.  **Power** for the strengthless (Rom. 5:6).
4.  **Purity** for the defiled (Acts 15:9).
5.  **Plenty** for the needy (Luke 14:16, 23).
6.  **Pleasure** for the dissatisfied (Phil. 4:6-11).
7.  **Productiveness** of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22).

\

    free” (Romans 8:2).
2.  **Spirit of God** to indwell. “The Spirit of God dwell in you”
    (Romans 8:9).
3.  **Spirit of Christ** to identify. “Have not the Spirit of Christ, he
    is none of His” (Romans 8:9).
4.  **Spirit of Power** to raise. “The Spirit of Him that raised up
    Jesus” (Romans 8:11).
5.  **Spirit of Might** to quicken. “Quicken your mortal bodies by His
    Spirit” (Romans 8:11).
6.  **Spirit of Leading** to guide. “Led by the Spirit of God” (Romans
    8:14).
7.  **Spirit of Witnessing** to cheer. “The Spirit Himself beareth
    witness” (Romans 8:16, R.V.).
8.  **Spirit of First-fruits** to pledge. “The first-fruits of the
    Spirit” (Romans 8:23).
9.  **Spirit of Help** to enable. “The Spirit also helpeth our
    infirmities” (Romans 8:26).
10. **Spirit of Intercession** to plead. “The Spirit Himself maketh
    intercession for us” (Romans 8:26, R.V.).
11. **Spirit of Interpretation** to make known. “The mind of the Spirit”
    (Romans 8:27).

* * * * *

\* The word “spirit” which occurs in the rest of the chapter, refers to
the new nature, as may be gathered from the R.V., where the term is
given with a small s.

7.  **Army to fight.** “The mountain was full of horses and chariots of
    fire round about” (2 Kings 6:17).

# 412. The Lord as the Helper

"HITHERTO the Lord hath helped us." What a Helper the Lord is!

1.  **Shielding Helper** (Psalm 33:20; Heb. 13:6); it matters not how
    many the enemies are, He is able to protect us by His presence,
    while effecting our deliverance.
2.  **Supplying Helper** (Psalm 40:17; Heb. 4:16); He gives more than
    cold help; He supplies all our need, and thus helps us indeed.
3.  **Sure Helper** (Psalm 46:1); we need not fear that He will fail us,
    we can always count upon Him.
4.  **Strong Helper** (Psalm 54:4); some friends are quite willing to
    help us, but they have not got the strength. Not so the Lord, He is
    the God (Elohim, the Three in One), who can aid us whatever the
    emergency is.
5.  **Sympathising Helper** (Psalm 89:19). The One who helps us is one
    of us-Christ-and therefore, understands our case completely.
6.  **Satisfying Helper** (Psalm 146:5). He meets our case at every
    point, and satisfies all our need.
7.  **Sustaining Helper** (Isaiah 41:10). There is an arm beneath us
    that is able to sustain us, we may therefore lean hard.

    (Psa. 115:11).
14. **Sheltering Shield.** “My Hiding-place and my Shield” (Psa.
    119:114).
15. **Subduing Shield.** “My Shield…who subdueth” (Psa. 144:2).

# 414. The Lord's Prayer

THE Lord’s Prayer may be summed up as follows:—

**Position.** A son adopted. “Our Father, which art in heaven.”

**Fitness.** A worshipper sanctified. “Hallowed be Thy name.”

**Allegiance.** A citizen enfranchised. “Thy kingdom come.”

**Usefulness.** A servant employed. “Thy will be done on earth as it is
in heaven.”

**Provision.** A beggar fed. “Give us this day our daily bread.”

**Pardon.** A sinner absolved. “And forgive us our debts, as we forgive
our debtors.”

**Safety.** A pilgrim guided. “And lead us not into temptation.”

**Victory.** A soldier succoured. “But deliver us from evil.”

**Testimony.** A witness’s confession. “For Thine is the kingdom.”

**Supply.** A weakling empowered. “The power.”

**Praise.** A chorister’s song. “And the glory.”

**Assurance.** A saint’s belief. “For ever.”

**Prayer.** A believer’s acquiescence. “Amen.”
# 415. The Lord's Preservation

I. CHRONICLES 18:6

1.  **Lips.** The Lord preserves our *lips* from evil speaking, as the
    tongue is seasoned with the salt of His grace (Col. 4:6).
2.  **Eyes.** The Lord preserves our *eyes* from evil occupation, as we
    look unto Jesus (Heb. 12:2).
3.  **Feet.** The Lord preserves our *feet* from going into by-paths, as
    we walk with Him (Mal. 2:6).
4.  **Hands.** The Lord preserves our *hands* from idleness, as we are
    used by Him in His service (Col. 1:29).
5.  **Heart.** The Lord preserves our *heart* from impurity, by His
    indwelling presence (Eph. 3:17).
6.  **Spirit.** The Lord preserves our *spirit* from backsliding, as we
    commune with Him (Song of Solomon 2:14).
7.  **Soul.** The Lord preserves our *soul* from ill, as its affection
    is set on Him (Col. 3:2).



# 416. The Lord's Supper

THERE are three ways to which the Lord’s Supper points. It bids us *look
back* to the *Cross*, and reminds us of what Christ *has done*; it
beckons us to *look up* to the *Throne*, and tells us of what Christ *is
doing*; and it beseeches us to *look on* to the *coming* Christ, and
proclaims what He is yet *going to do*. Let us look at these three
looks.

1.  **The backward look of Faith.** There are seven things in Mark
    14:22-23, that we note in relation to Christ’s action with the bread
    and cup.
    1.  He “*took*” the bread and cup. The bread represents the body,
        and the cup the blood of Christ. As Christ takes the bread and
        cup we are reminded of the fact that He took upon Him human
        nature (Heb. 2:16), that He might suffer for us in His divinely
        prepared body (Heb. 10:5, 10).
    2.  Christ “*blessed*” the bread, and gave “*thanks*” for the cup.
        In this we are reminded of the Lord Jesus as He acquiesced in
        the Divine plan, although it meant so much suffering to Him, for
        we must never forget that it pleased God to bruise Christ
        (Isaiah 53:10), and to give Him the bitter cup He drank (Mark
        14:36; John 18:11).
    3.  Christ “*brake*” the bread. In the broken bread we see
        symbolized the sufferings that Christ endured in His body
        (Isaiah 53:5).
    4.  Christ “*said*,” in explaining what the bread and wine
        represented, that they signified His body and blood. Not, as
        Rome teaches, that the bread and wine are actually the body and
        blood of Christ, but that they are symbolized by them.
    5.  Christ “*gave*” the bread and wine to His disciples. In like
        manner He has given Himself *for* us, and given Himself *to* us
        (Gal. 2:20; Song of Solomon 2:16).
    6.  Christ told His disciples to “*take*” the bread and wine. We
        take Christ by an act of faith (John 1:12), and make all He
        *has* and *is*, ours by so doing.
    7.  Christ bade His disciples, not only to take the bread, but to
        “*eat*” it. It is an essential that those who believe in Christ
        should feed upon Him, as He Himself says in John 6:54.

    As we look to the Cross and remember the Christ who suffered there,
    we gladly say, “His death is the *price* of our salvation” (1 Cor.
    6:20), the *pass* into God’s presence (Heb. 10:19), the
    *propitiation* for our guilt (Rom. 3:25), the *peacemaker* for our
    reconciliation (Col. 1:20), the *power* of our Christian life (Heb.
    13:12), the *provider* of our blessing (Eph. 1:7), and the *plea* of
    our testimony (1 Corinthians 15:1).
2.  **The upward look of Love.** “This do in remembrance of Me” (1 Cor.
    11:25). The Lord’s Supper not only reminds us of what Christ has
    done for us, but of the great Worker who accomplished the task.
    Faith leads us to rest on the work of atonement, but love leads us
    to praise the Atoner, and causes our heart’s affection to twine
    around Him, even as the ivy clings round the oak. Love leads us to
    appreciate Christ for what He *is*, as well as for what He has done,
    even as Mephibosheth thought more of the king than he did of his
    gifts (2 Sam. 19:30). It is the Person of Christ which gives value
    to the work, and, while we must never under-estimate the work of
    Christ on the cross, we must ever remember the Person who died (2
    Tim. 2:8), and call to mind that Christ is the living, loving
    Saviour, who bids us remember Him in the breaking of bread (Acts
    20:7), and says, “It is I, Myself” (Luke 24:39), and as we thus
    consider Him (Heb. 3:1), our heart’s affection will be drawn to Him,
    even as the needle is attracted to the magnet, and we in turn shall
    influence others (Song of Solomon 1:4).
3.  **The outward look of Hope.** “Till He come” (1 Cor. 11:26). We are
    bidden to remember Christ in the simple and yet speaking ordinance
    of the Lord’s Supper. Thus hope goes up the stairs of faith, and
    looks out of the window which love has opened, and views the coming
    of the Lord Jesus in His grace and glory (1 Thess. 4:16-17; Col.
    3:4; 1 John 3:2).

The whole triangle or trinity of Christ’s work is brought before us in
the Lord’s Supper. What He has done, what He is doing, and what He is
yet going to do, are pressed upon our attention as we gather around the
Lord and sit with Him at His table. The three appearings of Hebrews
9:24-28, are thus illustrated in remembering the Lord’s death.
# 417. The Man of Faith

1.  **Testimony of Faith.** “There shall be no loss of any man’s life
    among you” (Acts 27:22).
2.  **Fellowship of Faith.** Presence of the Lord. “There stood by me
    this night the angel of God” (Acts 27:23).
3.  **Promise of Faith.** “Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before
    Caesar” (Acts 27:24).
4.  **Confidence of Faith.** Power. “I believe God that it shall be”
    (Acts 27:25).
5.  **Rest of Faith.** Peace. “Abide in the ship” (Acts 27:31).
6.  **Cheerfulness of Faith.** Praise. “They were all of good cheer”
    (Acts 27:36).
7.  **Reward of Faith.** Preserved. “They escaped all safe to land”
    (Acts 27:44).

# 418. “The Man of God”

THE title, “the man of God,” only occurs twice in the New Testament, but
it is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament. If the following
Scriptures are pondered, a few of the many traits which should be seen
in the life of a man of God will be discovered, but the principal
thought in connection with this title is, a man of God is one who is
walking with God, and therefore He can speak to him, and through him to
others. A man of God is:-

1.  A man of blessing to cheer (Deut. 33:1).
2.  A man of atonement to direct (2 Chron. 30:16).
3.  A man of messages to speak (Josh. 14:6; 1 Kings 12:22; 13:1, 4-8,
    11-12, 14, 21, 26, 29, 31).
4.  A man of chastisement to afflict (1 Sam. 2:27).
5.  A man of piety to witness (1 Sam. 9:6-8, 10).
6.  A man of prayer to influence (1 Kings 17:18, 24).
7.  A man of encouragement to stimulate (1 Kings 20:28).
8.  A man of power to demonstrate (2 Kings 1:9-13).
9.  A man of sympathy to console (2 Kings 4:27).
10. A man of humbling to humiliate (2 Kings 5:8-14).
11. A man of warning to guard (2 Kings 6:10).
12. A man of feeling to commiserate (2 Kings 8:11).
13. A man of thoroughness to exterminate (2 Kings 13:19).
14. A man of prophecy to foretell (2 Kings 23:16-17).
15. A man of order to arrange (2 Chron. 8:14).
16. A man of restraint to hinder (2 Chron. 11:2).
17. A man of praise to worship (Neh. 12:24, 36).
18. A man of holiness to separate (1 Tim. 6:11).
19. A man of Scripture to equip (2 Tim. 3:17).

# 419. The Mercy-Seat

CHRIST, as the Propitiation or Mercy Seat, is mentioned in 1 John 2:2.
The words mercy seat and atonement come from a root word which means to
cover; it is a blessed fact, that not only are our sins forgiven, but we
are completely covered by Him who is our Mercy Seat. As illustrating
Him, let us look at the mercy seat in the tabernacle.

1.  **All-gold mercy seat** (Ex. 37:6). Reminding us that God, and God
    alone, is the *Source* and *Dispenser* of mercy, that Christ alone
    is the *Channel* of mercy, and the Holy Spirit the only One that
    reveals this fact to us.
2.  **Blood-sprinkled mercy seat** (Lev. 16:14-15). On the day of
    atonement the blood was sprinkled once on, and seven times before
    the mercy seat. This reminds us of what Christ has done, namely,
    perfectly met the claims of God, and brought us into a perfect
    standing before God.
3.  **Firmly-secured mercy seat** (Ex. 37:12). There was a border or
    crown round about it to keep it in its place. To remove the mercy
    seat was death (see 1 Sam. 6:19), because the ministration of death
    (the law) was in the ark, but the border would keep the mercy seat
    on the ark, telling us that not only is Christ our Mercy Seat, but
    the One who maintains His position as such before God for us,
    because of what He is in Himself-“the righteousness of God.” Thus we
    see in the mercy seat, mercy, and in the border, righteousness, or
    “mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace kissing each
    other.”

# 420. The Most Comprehensive Verse in the Bible

“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life”
(John 3:16).

DR. A. T. PIERSON calls this verse “the heart of the Gospel.” Verily,
every word is warm with the life of the love of God, for the blood of
His compassion courses through every vein of it. But we have not merely
the heart of the Gospel in this verse. We have also the height of the
Gospel, for it takes us up to the throne of God, as we muse upon the
term “God,” from whom all love emanates; and it also carries us on to
the far-reaching sea of the eternal blessedness of the redeemed in
glory, as we meditate on the words “eternal life.”

The comprehensiveness of this verse may be gathered if we carefully and
prayerfully ponder each word, for as each leaf of the tree is a
*fac-simile* of the tree itself, so each word of this verse portrays the
love of God.

1.  The **association of love** is found in the conjunction “*for*.”
2.  The **Embodiment of love** is found in the name “*God*.”
3.  The **expressiveness of love** is made known in the monosyllable
    “*so*.”
4.  The **fact of love** is revealed in the verb “*loved*.”
5.  The **exclusiveness of love** is proclaimed in the definite article
    “*the*.”
6.  The **object of love** is seen in the noun “*world*.”
7.  The **gift of love** is evidenced in the word “*gave*.”
8.  The **sacrifice of love** is discovered in the word “*only*.”
9.  The **becomingness of love** is unfolded in the adjective
    “*begotten*.”
10. The **relationship of love** is made known in the noun “*Son*.”
11. The **purpose of love** is seen in the conjunction “*that*.”
12. The **offer of love** is made in the relative pronoun “*whosoever*.”
13. The **condition of love** is stated in the verb “*believeth*.”
14. The **power of love** appears in the words “*in Him*.”
15. The **salvation of love** shines forth in the connection with the
    verb “*perish*.”
16. The **assurance of love** is revealed in the verb “*have*.”
17. The **bestowment of love** is preached in the words “*everlasting
    life*.”

\




# 421. The New Birth

THE new birth is the door of the Kingdom of God (John 3:3)

1.  **Necessity of the new birth.** “Ye must be born again” (John 3:7).
    The “must” tells us of the absolute necessity.
2.  **Author of the new birth.** “Of His own will begat He us” (James
    1:18). God is the Author of the new creation, as well as of the old.
3.  **Procurer of the new birth.** “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is
    the Christ is born of God” (1 John 5:1). The Christ, who died, is
    the Procurer of the new life.
4.  **Effecter of the new birth.** “Born of the Spirit” (John 3:6). The
    Holy Spirit is the Effective Worker in grace.
5.  **Instrument of the new birth.** “Being born again, not of
    corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God” (1 Peter
    1:23).
6.  **Evidence of the new birth.** (See 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1;
    5:18, R.V.).

# 422. The New Home in Canaan

DEUT. 6:3-15

“NO place like home!” is a refrain that finds an echo in most hearts.
Rest and refreshment, comfort and company, are the characteristics of a
true home.

1.  **The blessing of home.** The home of the soul is the Lord Himself.
    When we are right with the Lord it is well with us. Mark the railway
    that may be made in the Bible in connection with the word “well.”
    -   “Well with them” (Deu. 5:29).
    -   “Well with you” (Deu. 5:33).
    -   “Well with thee” (Deu. 6:3).
    -   “Well with thee” (Deu. 6:18).

    See also the forerunners of this wellness-
    -   “Keep” (Deu. 5:29).
    -   “Walk” (Deu. 5:33).
    -   “Observe” (Deu. 6:3).
    -   “Do” (Deu. 6:18).

    The prodigal found all his trouble, want, and misery through getting
    away from home, and he found all the blessings of home when he came
    back to his father. The moral is this: if we want the blessings of
    home, we must keep at home (Psalm 91).
2.  **Provision in the home** (Deu. 6:3). The land of Canaan was a land
    of plenty. As the Lord gave Israel plenty of earthly blessing, so He
    has given the believer the riches of His grace and glory. We are
    blest according to the riches of His grace (Eph. 1:7), supplied
    according to the riches in glory (Phil. 4:19), strengthened
    according to the riches of His glory for spiritual life (Eph. 3:16),
    and saved according to the riches of His mercy (Eph. 2:4). Mark the
    *measure* of the supply, not “*out of*” the riches of the Lord, as
    is often said, but “*according*” to the riches of His glory.
3.  **The head of the home.** “The Lord our God is one Lord” (Deu. 6:4).
    These words denote the Lord’s supremacy, sovereignty, and strength,
    and because He is the one only Jehovah, He, therefore, claims the
    entire affection of the heart (Deu. 6:5). He will not allow any
    rival. Every Dagon must fall before the ark of His presence (1 Sam.
    5), and the glory of every person must fade before the glory of
    Himself (Matt. 17:5-8).
4.  **The rules for the home** (Deu. 6:6-9). The rules that God gave,
    were to be in the hearts of the Israelites; as Trapp says, “Bible
    men should get stamped in their heads and in their hearts, as David
    did (Psalm 119:11). Knowledge that swims in the head only, and sinks
    not down into the heart, does no more good than rain in the middle
    region doth, or than the unicorn’s horn in the unicorn’s head.” If
    the word of the Lord is photographed on the heart, it will give
    forth its impression in the life.\
     Note, the *mind* is to *observe* (Deu. 6:3), the *heart* is to
    *treasure up* (Deu. 6:6), the *tongue* is to *teach* (Deu. 6:7), the
    *conversation* is to be *saturated* (Deu. 6:7), the *walk* is to be
    *influenced* by (Deu. 6:7), the *hand* is to be *guided* (Deu. 6:8),
    the *eyes* are to be *directed* (Deu. 6:8), the *house* is to be
    *identified* with (Deu. 6:9), and every *attitude* is to be
    controlled by (Deu. 6:7) the Word of the Lord.
5.  **Warning to the members of the home** (Deu. 6:10-13). The children
    of Israel were warned not to “forget” the Lord, and charged to
    “fear,” “serve” and “swear by His name.” Trapp quaintly remarks,
    “Saturity oft breeds security, fulness, forgetfulness. The best,
    when full fed, are apt to wax wanton, and will be dipping their
    fingers in the devil’s sauce. The moon never suffers eclipse but at
    the full, and that by the earth’s interposition. The young mulets,
    when they have sucked, turn up their heels and kick at the dam.
    Should we with the fed hawk forget our Master? Or being full of
    God’s benefits, like the moon, be then most removed from the sun,
    from whom she hath all her light? (see Prov. 30:8-9). We are no
    sooner grown rich, but we are apt to utter that ugly word, ‘This I
    may thank myself for.’”
6.  **Remaining at home** (Deu. 6:14-15). Israel was not permitted to go
    after other gods. The Lord was to be their portion. What a portion
    He is! We cannot be poor when we have Him. We must be poor without
    Him. What David said to Abiathar, “Abide thou with me, fear not; for
    he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life; but with me thou shalt be
    in safeguard” (1 Sam. 22:23), the Lord says to us. Let us trust and
    obey, and all will be well.

# 423. The Observant Christ

“HE SAW”

NO needy object escaped the beneficent look of Christ. “He saw” are
notes which Holy Spirit plays upon continually, in drawing our attention
to the swiftness of Christ’s gaze in noting those who were needing His
help and His readiness to aid them.

1.  **Blessing.** He saw the faith of others, and blessed for their
    faith’s sake (Luke 5:20).
2.  **Calling.** He saw one who was willing to serve Him, and called him
    to follow after Him (Luke 5:27).
3.  **Comforting.** He saw a sorrowing one, and comforted her by raising
    her son from the dead (Luke 7:13).
4.  **Delivering.** He saw one bound by Satan, and delivered her (Luke
    13:13).
5.  **Cleansing.** He saw those who were diseased, and cleansed them
    (Luke 17:14).
6.  **Saving.** He saw a seeking one, and saved him (Luke 19:5).
7.  **Rescuing.** He saw those who were distressed, and rescued them
    (Mark 6:48).
8.  **Revealing.** He saw the blind man, and revealed Himself to him
    (John 9:1).


# 424. The Passover Instituted

EXODUS 12:1-14

THE Lord passes over His people in judgment, but passes through the
midst of those who do not belong to Him. This is strikingly illustrated
in the two passings mentioned in Exodus 12: We direct attention-

1.  **Jehovah passing; over His people.** The Hebrew word “Pesak,”
    rendered passover, comes from “Pasak,” which means “to leap over,”
    or “to move from one object to another.” The noun “Pesak” occurs
    forty-eight times in the Old Testament, and is always given
    “passover.” The verb “Pasak” is translated “pass over” in Exodus
    12:13, 23, 27, and Isaiah 31:5. The same term occurs in 1 Kings
    18:26, where the priests of Baal are said to have “leaped upon the
    altar,” or as the Vulgate “leaped over,” or as the Septuagint “ran
    over.” The Prophet Elijah uses the same expression in 1 Kings 18:21,
    when he says, “How long halt ye between two opinions?” The image is
    taken from birds hopping backward and forward from one branch of a
    tree to another. Young brings this out in his translation of the
    passage. He renders it:—“Till when are ye leaping on the two
    branches? If Jehovah is God, go after Him; and, if Baal, go after
    him.” The Israelites, in mixing up the worship of Jehovah with that
    of Baal, were like lame men, who tread not firmly but dubiously.\
     It is of interest to know that the same term is used in describing
    the result of the accident which happened to Mephibosheth, who in
    consequence of the nurse letting him fall, “became lame” (2 Sam.
    4:4). As the priests of Baal went over the altars erected to him; as
    the Israelites in their sin, sought to identify the worship of
    Jehovah with the worship of Baal, thus were passing over from the
    one to the other; and as the lame man passes over the ordinary gait
    in his walk through his lameness; so Jehovah passed over his people
    when He was about to deal with the land of Egypt in judgment. The
    Lord uses the same word in Isaiah 31:5, when He promised to defend
    Jerusalem from the Assyrians:—“As birds flying, so will the Lord of
    Hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also He will deliver it; and
    passing over, He will preserve it.”\
     As an eagle, seeing a bird of prey approaching its young, passes
    over them to the object of danger, and in meeting and overcoming it
    preserves its offspring from the peril to which they were exposed;
    so the Lord passed over the city of Jerusalem to the army of the
    king of Assyria, that lay encamped against it, and by smiting him
    and his host, protected the earthly Zion from the destruction which
    threatened it.\
     How was it Jehovah passed over the first-born of Israel, seeing
    that they were mixed up with Egypt’s sins and idolatry, and
    therefore deserved judgment as well as the first-born of Egypt? It
    was-\
     *For the sake of the Lord Jesus*, whose death was prefigured in the
    slain lamb and sprinkled blood. There can be no question about this
    in the light of Rom. 3:24-25 (R.V.), where it says, “Christ Jesus,
    whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, by His
    blood, to shew His righteousness, because of the *passing over of
    the sins done aforetime*, in the forbearance of God.” Mark the words
    that we have put in italics, for they say in an unmistakable manner
    that the ground of God’s action of grace towards His people in the
    past, was founded on the death of Christ; as Dr. Brown says, “The
    sins which are here referred to, are not those of the believer
    before he embraces Christ, but those committed *under the ancient
    economy*, before Christ came to “put away sin by the sacrifice of
    Himself.” Hence the apostle, instead of using the common word which
    signifies *remission*, studiously uses a very different word,
    nowhere else employed, signifying ‘pretermission’ or ‘passing by’;
    and hence also this ‘passing by’ is ascribed to ‘the *forbearance*
    of God,’ who is viewed as not so much *remitting*, as *bearing with
    them*, until an adequate atonement for them should be made.”\
     “In thus not imputing them, God *was* righteous, but He was not
    *seen* to be so. There was no ‘manifestation of His righteousness’
    in doing so under the ancient economy; but now that God can ‘set
    forth’ Christ as a ‘propitiation through faith in His blood,’ the
    righteousness of His procedure in passing by the sins of believers
    before, and in now remitting them, is ‘manifested,’ declared,
    brought fully out to the view of the whole world.”\
     *The reason why God passes over the believer now is the same as
    that given to Israel*, viz., “When I see the blood, I will pass over
    you” (Ex. 12:13). Not when I see your good resolutions, your firm
    intentions, your earnest prayers, your much almsgiving, your zealous
    works, your extreme fasting, your penitent tears, your strong faith,
    but “when I see the blood.”
    -   “It is not our tears of repentance, nor prayers,
    -   But the blood that atones for the soul.”

2.  **Passing through the midst of the Egyptians.** “I will pass through
    the land,” &c. (Ex. 12:12, 23). The expression that relates to the
    Lord passing through the land of Egypt is different from that which
    is used of the Lord passing over the Israelites. In the latter case
    it means a “leaping over,” or “flying over from one object to
    another;” but in the former it signifies “a passing through the
    midst,” as when the burning lamp passed between the pieces of
    Abram’s sacrifice (Gen. 15:17); or when a traveller passes through a
    given district. The following instances where the same Hebrew word
    occurs, which is rendered “pass through” in Ex. 12:12, 23, will give
    us to see the above more clearly.
    1.  Moses and God’s glory. “While My glory passeth by” (Exodus
        33:22).
    2.  Edom and Israel. “Edom refused to give Israel passage” (Numbers
        20:21).
    3.  God’s decree to the sea. “Waters should not pass His
        commandment” (Proverbs 8:29).
    4.  Saul’s confession to Samuel. “I have transgressed the
        commandment” (1 Sam. 15:24).
    5.  The Psalmist’s iniquities. “Mine iniquities are gone over mine
        head” (Psalm 38:4).
    6.  The frailty of man compared to grass. “The wind passeth over it”
        (Psalm 103:16).
    7.  Judgment. “The overflowing scourge shall pass through” (Isaiah
        28:15).

    From the above passages of Scripture it will be gathered that the
    term under consideration means “to pass over the face of an object,”
    as when the Psalmist says his iniquities have gone over him, as a
    wave that submerges the swimmer, or as when the Psalmist uses the
    figure of the wind passing over the grass and withering it. The word
    also signifies “to pass alongside,” as when the Lord passed by
    Moses, and enabled him to behold His goodness. Yet, again, the
    expression is expressive of “passing through,” as when Edom would
    not allow Israel passage through their country; or as when one
    passes through a command by going beyond its prescribed boundary; or
    as when an overwhelming scourge causes the inhabitants of a certain
    place to be destroyed because they are in the way of its onward
    rush. Parkhurst, in his Hebrew Lexicon, gives the following
    illustrations of the appellation:—
    “A ferry-boat, for passing over a river” (2 Sam. 19:18).
    “A pass or passage” (1 Sam. 14:4).
    “In Gen. 10:21, Shem, the progenitor of the holy line, is styled the
    father of all the children (not of Eber, his great grandson, for how
    was he more the father of him than of his other descendants? but) of
    passage or pilgrimage. The father of all those who were passengers,
    pilgrims, itinerants, passing from one place to another, as the holy
    line were, till their settlement in Canaan, and who also confessed
    themselves to be strangers and pilgrims on earth, plainly declaring
    thereby that they sought a better country. Of Abraham in particular
    it is written that he passed through the land (Gen. 12:6), and
    during his pilgrimage from one place to another in the land of
    promise, wherein he sojourned as in a strange country, the epithet a
    pilgrim or stranger is used.

# 425. Touch of the Lord

THE touch of the Lord signifies His power (Daniel 8:18; Amos 9:5;
Matthew 8:3).

1.  **Subjugation.** The touched *thigh* signifies His power to subdue
    (Gen. 32:25).
2.  **Purification.** The touched *lips* denote His power to cleanse
    (Isaiah 6:7).
3.  **Inspiration.** The touched *mouth* refers to His power to enable
    to speak (Jeremiah 1:9).
4.  **Illumination.** The touched *eyes* signify His power to give sight
    (Matthew 9:29).
5.  **Impartation.** The touched *ear* points to His power to cause to
    hear (Mark 7:33).
6.  **Liberation.** The touched *tongue* indicates His ability to
    unloose the powers of speech (Mark 7:33).
7.  **Compassion.** The touched *hand* illustrates His power to raise
    for His service (Matt. 8:15).
8.  **Attraction.** The touched *heart* shows His power to mould the
    wills of men in causing them to follow His word and to fulfil His
    pleasure (1 Sam. 10:26).

God-touched hearts are sympathetic hearts to succour, steadfast hearts
to influence, sure hearts to comfort, strong hearts to sustain, stalwart
hearts to encourage, staunch hearts to endure, and sincere hearts to
follow.


# 426. The Passage of the Red Sea

EXODUS 14:19-29

WE have a striking illustration in the children of Israel at the Red
Sea, of what it means for the Lord to be *for* us or to be *against* us.

Israel was for God in obeying His word in relation to the Pascal lamb
and Passover feast, hence the Lord is for them in protecting them in the
moment of their peril. If we side with God, God is on our side.

1.  **The Lord for us means that He is between us and every foe.** The
    “angel of God” removed from the front of the camp to the rear, and
    thus was between Israel and the Egyptians (Exo. 14:19). “A tradition
    current in the West of Scotland, tells that when one of the
    Covenanting preachers and his little band of hearers had been
    suprised on a hillside by the military, the minister cried out,
    ‘Lord, throw Thy mantle over us and protect us.’ And immediately out
    of the clear sky there fell a mist, which sundered and protected the
    pursued from the pursuers. And a Netherland tradition tells how a
    little army of Protestants were once saved from the King of Spain’s
    troops by the flashing lights and noise as of an army sent by the
    Lord to throw confusion into the camp of the enemy. Some will
    remember the story of the Christian woman who, calmly awaiting in
    her home the approach of the enemy, was, in answer to her prayer,
    saved from them by a circling wall of snow. The dividing pillar is a
    reality yet.”\
     When the Lord is between us and the foe, or any danger, they must
    touch Him before they can touch us, for “the Angel of the Lord
    encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them”(Psalm
    34:7).
2.  **The Lord for us means that we have light.** The pillar of cloud
    gave light to Israel at night (Exo. 14:20). As when Israel was in
    Goshen there was light in their dwellings when there was darkness
    over the land of Egypt for three days, so that the Egyptians did not
    rise from their places, nor saw each other; so there is light from
    the pillar of cloud for Israel’s comfort and guidance when before
    the Red Sea. Those who are not the Lord’s are in darkness (Isaiah
    60:2), but those who are the Lord’s are called out of darkness into
    light, that is, from a state of sin, ignorance, and unbelief, into a
    state of knowledge, faith, and holiness (1 Peter 2:9), and are also
    said to be “light in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8).
3.  **The Lord for us means that we have an opening through a seemingly
    impassable sea of difficulties.** There was no prospect, humanly
    speaking, for Israel to escape from the Egyptians. The mountains on
    either side of them, the enemy in the rear, and the sea in front,
    but the Lord “maketh a way in the sea” (Isaiah 43:16). The Lord bids
    His children to “go forward” into the *sea of difficulty* counting
    upon His guidance, into the *sea of sorrow* receiving His comfort,
    into the *sea of trial* leaning on His strength, into the *sea of
    life* trusting in Himself, into the *sea of the world* abiding in
    His presence, into the *sea of conflict* armed in His armour, and
    into the *sea of labour* looking to Him to supply all the need.
4.  **The Lord for us means deliverance from the enemy.** How repeatedly
    we find the Lord to the front in the verses before us.\
    *Presence*-“The angel of God” (Exo. 14:19).
    *Power*-“The Lord caused” (Exo. 14:21).
    *Penetration*-“The Lord looked” (Exo. 14:24).
    *Protection*-“The Lord fighteth” (Exo. 14:25).
    *Direction*-“The Lord said” (Exo. 14:26).
    *Punishment*-“The Lord overthrew” (Exo. 14:27).

# 427. The Prince of Peace

ISAIAH 9:2-7

THE following acrostic on the title “Prince,” illustrates what kind of a
Prince, Christ is.

 P Powerful Prince. 
:   He is “the Mighty God” (Isa. 9:6). He is mighty in many ways. His
    mighty acts declare His power. He is mighty to *save* (Psalm 89:19);
    He is mighty to *deliver* (Deut. 6:21; 7:8, 19); He is mighty to
    *conquer* (Josh. 4:24; 2 Cor. 10:4); He is mighty to *strengthen*
    (Gen. 49:24); He is mighty to use in His *service* (Col. 1:29); He
    is mighty in *word* (Luke 24:19); and He is mighty in *work* (Mark
    6:2).
 R Royal Prince. 
:   Some men have occupied princely places who have not a royal
    pedigree. Not so with Christ, for He is the “Son” (Isa. 9:6). His
    royalty is of heavenly origin, for He is the Son of God; and He is
    of the royal line of David, and as such will sit upon the “throne of
    David” (Isa. 9:7), in the time to come. Christ is royal in every
    sense of the word. He is royal in birth, royal in giving, royal in
    love, royal in grace, royal in truth, royal in action, and royal in
    utterance.
 I Incarnate Prince. 
:   He who was the Son of God became the Son of Man that He might make
    the sons of men, who believe in Him, sons of God; hence we read,
    “Unto us a Child is born.” By His birth He became our Kinsman (Heb.
    2:14), that He might have the right to redeem us. The action of
    Christ as the Saviour is a trinity, as seen in His incarnation,
    crucifixion, and resurrection. These must never be separated, for
    the one is essential to the other to complete the triangle of
    Christ’s complete redemptive work as far as it relates to His
    atonement.
 N Noble Prince. 
:   He is “Wonderful,” and “Counsellor.” Christ is noble in His
    wonderful love. David said of Jonathan’s love that it surpassed the
    love of women (2 Sam. 1:26). We must say of Christ’s love that it
    surpasses all other love. It is a height without a top, a depth
    without a bottom, a length without a measure, and a breadth without
    a calculation. Christ is noble in His comprehensive counsel. The
    Septuagint renders “Counsellor” “Messenger of great counsel.” “Who
    teacheth like Him?” None. He eclipses all others. “Never man spake
    like this Man” (John 7:46).
 C Conquering Prince (Isa. 9:4). 
:   Christ is the mighty Man of valour. He goes forth conquering and to
    conquer. He overcomes the strong man armed (Luke 11:22), and strips
    the powers of darkness (Col. 2:15). He is the Angel that will cast
    Satan into the bottomless pit and set a seal upon him (Rev. 20:1-3).
    He leads forth His armies and gains the victory (Rev. 19:11-15); and
    as we have faith in Him we, too, overcome by His power (1 John 5:4).
 E Eternal Prince (Isa. 9:6-7). 
:   He is the “Everlasting Father,” and the One of the increase of whose
    government there shall be “no end”; yea, “for ever” shall His
    righteous rule be prolonged. Unlike earthly monarchs, who come and
    go, this One shall remain, for His kingdom is spoken of as “the
    everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (2 Peter
    1:11).

# 428. The Report of the Spies

NUMBERS 13:17-20, 23-33

THERE are certain words and expressions we may take as hubs around which
the spokes of thought are found.

1.  **The “Get you up” of commission** (Numbers 13:17). Moses bids the
    spies go search the land and see what kind of a land it was, and
    what kind of inhabitants dwelt in it. It is well to know the
    strength and character of the enemy we have to conquer. As with
    Israel, so with us, when the Lord bids us to go in a given
    direction, it matters not how great the difficulties, or how
    formidable the foe, we shall have grace to surmount the one and to
    overcome the other. With every “*Go*” of command, He gives us the
    “*Lo*” of His presence (Matthew 28:19-20).
2.  **The “be ye of good courage” of fortitude** (Numbers 13:20). True
    courage is the outcome of the fear of God. He who fears God need
    fear no foe. He who has looked into the face of God can look into
    the face of any man. True courage has consistency as its forerunner
    (Joshua 1:6-7). Ken says,
    -   “Stand but your ground, your ghostly foes will fly-
    -   Hell trembles at a heaven-directed eye;
    -   Choose rather to defend than to assail-
    -   Self-confidence will in the conflict fail:
    -   When you are challenged, you may dangers meet-
    -   True courage is a fixed, not sudden heat;
    -   Is always humble, lives in self-distrust,
    -   And will itself into no danger thrust.
    -   Devote yourself to God, and you will find
    -   God fights the battles of a will resign’d.
    -   Love Jesus! love will no base fear endure;
    -   Love Jesus! and of conquest rest secure.”

3.  **The “nevertheless” of unbelief** (Numbers 13:28). Unbelief always
    magnifies difficulties and makes them far larger than they are.
    “There is always a ‘nevertheless’ where man is concerned, and when
    unbelief is at work. The unbelieving spies *saw* the
    difficulties-great cities, high walls, tall giants. All these things
    they saw; but they did not see Jehovah at all. They looked at the
    things that were seen, rather than at the things which were unseen.
    Their eye was not fixed upon Him who is invisible. Doubtless, the
    cities were great; but God was greater. The walls were high; but God
    was higher. The giants were strong; but God was stronger.”
4.  **The “well able” of faith** (Numbers 13:30). The man of faith who
    looks to God, and remembers what He is able to do, exclaims, “We are
    well able to overcome.” C. H. M. well remarks, “Faith looks the
    difficulties straight in the face. It is not ignorant-not
    indifferent-not reckless; but-what! IT BRINGS IN THE LIVING GOD. It
    looks to Him; it leans on Him; it draws from Him. Here lies the
    grand secret of its power. It cherishes the calm and deep conviction
    that there never was a wall too high for the Almighty God-never a
    city too great-never a giant too strong. Faith is the only thing
    that puts God in His proper place; and, as a consequence, is the
    only thing that lifts the soul completely above the influences of
    surrounding circumstances, be they what they may.”
5.  **The “not able” of despair** (Numbers 13:31). What a contrast this
    to the “well able” of Caleb! “Stronger than we” is the exclamation
    of despair, as the enemy is compared with the self-occupied ones;
    but surely the foe is not stronger than *He*! Ah! It makes all the
    difference whether it be “*He*” or “*We*.” There is only the
    difference of one letter, but to take away the “*W*” and put “*H*”
    in its place, means the displacement of self, and the destruction of
    despair. If the warfare depends upon us there will be defeat, but
    since it depends upon the Lord there must be victory, if we trust
    Him. Despair is born of self-occupation and through viewing self’s
    resources. There is only one way to get rid of self, and that is, to
    put Him in front of it, then self reads Himself. Or to put it in
    another way, the way to displace “I” is to put “Chr” in front of it
    and “st” behind it, then “I” is lost in Christ-
    CHR-I-ST (Gal 2:20).
6.  **The “evil report” of half-heartedness** (Numbers 13:32).
    Half-heartedness is a worm that will kill any plant of grace. The
    reason why so many fail is, because there is a lack of thoroughness.
    Half-heartedness is the forerunner of defeat. Half-heartedness
    magnifies difficulties, hesitates in danger, discourages timid ones,
    breeds unbelief, lacks hack-bone, cripples devotion, and thinks much
    of itself.
7.  **The “we saw” of short-sightedness** (Numbers 13:33). The
    evil-reporters saw the great ones of earth, but they did not see the
    Great One of heaven. If tbey had looked at the great ones from God’s
    point of view, they would have seen that they were but as
    “grasshoppers” in His sight (Isaiah 40:22). Instead of this, the
    spies say that they are “as grasshoppers.” If we look at
    difficulties and dangers through the medium of earth’s spectacles we
    shall be discouraged, and a discouraged man is a defeated one; but
    if we stand on the mountain top of fellowship with God, earth’s
    great ones will be pigmies.

# 429. The Rich Young Ruler

MARK 10:17-27

LUKE tells us that the rich young ruler only lacked one thing (Luke
18:22), but that was a fatal defect. For a chain to lack one sound link
means the danger of that which it upholds.

1.  **What the rich young ruler wanted.** “Eternal life” (Mark 10:17).
    Eternal life is the life which is the “life indeed” (1 Tim. 6:19,
    R.V.). What it means to want this life may be gathered by noting
    what it is. Eternal life-
    -   God is its Source (John 5:26).
    -   The Risen Christ is its Channel (Hebrews 7:16).
    -   The Holy Spirit is its Power (Rom. 8:2).
    -   Faith is its Receiver (John 3:36).
    -   Fruit is its Evidence (Rom. 6:22).
    -   Christ Himself is its Embodiment (1 John 5:20).
    -   Glory is its Manifestation (Col. 3:4).
    -   Eternity is its Duration (John 10:28).
    -   Union with Christ is its Meaning (John 6:53-54),
    -   Knowing God and Christ as the Sent One is its Explanation (John
        17:3).

    The one mistake the young ruler made, was that he wanted to earn
    this life by his doing. “What must I *do* to enherit eternal life?”
    is his cry. No man’s doing can give Him the right to this blessing,
    for eternal life is the gift of God (Rom. 6:23).
2.  **What the young ruler had done.** According to the ruler’s
    statement, he had a good record behind him (Mark 10:19-20). But
    man’s estimate of the worth of his actions, and God’s are two
    different things. God weighs man’s actions in the scales of the
    sanctuary, and the verdict of every doing of man is “come short”
    (Rom. 3:23). If there are none that doeth good (Rom. 3:12), how can
    any do good in the truest sense of the word? Yea, Christ Himself
    said to this young man, “There is none good, but One, that is God”
    (Mark 10:18). See the “*Alls*,” the “*Nones*,” the “*Not ones*” of
    Romans 3:9-23, as to the universality of human depravity. There are
    degrees in sinning, but there is no degree in that all are tainted
    by sin. No difference as to what we *are*, there is a difference as
    to what we have *done*. There may be six crab apple trees in a wood,
    which are very different as to the apples they bear with regard to
    the quantity, but there is no difference as to the fact that they
    are all crab apple trees; so with us, there is no difference as to
    the fact that all are sinners, but there is a great difference as to
    the fruit of sin in the lives.
3.  **What the young ruler would not do.** Christ told the ruler to do
    five things, which are associated with the five following words:—
    “Sell,” “give,” “come,” “take,” “follow.” He was to sell what he
    had, give it to the poor, come to Christ, take up his cross and
    follow Christ. The ruler did not stand the test, for he went away
    sorrowful. The one great lesson in the incident is, that if anything
    is a hindrance to coming to Christ and following Him, it must be
    given up. It matters not how dear it is; if it is some earthly
    friend, better to separate from him than be separated from Christ
    (Luke 14:26), if it be a member of the body that is a
    stumbling-block, better for it to be cut off (Matt. 5:29-30), than
    to be cut off from the Lord of Life and Glory.

Thank God, it is easy to be saved, because Christ by His death has
removed the hindrance (Heb. 9:26), but it is not an easy thing to live
as a Christian (1 Peter 4:18). There is a battle to be fought (1 Tim.
6:12), a trust to be kept (2 Cor. 5:18), a talent to be used (Matt.
25:14, &c.), an enemy to overcome (1 Peter 5:8-9), a watch to maintain
(Mark 13:37), a ministry to fulfil (John 13:14), and a prize to win
(Phil. 3:14).
# 430. The Secret of Victory

II. CHRONICLES xx

THEY who side with God are always sure of having the Lord on their side.
See the case of the Levites in Exodus 32:26.

1.  **Seeking** the Lord is the forerunner of victory (2Chron. 20:3).
2.  **Praying** to the Lord is the plea for victory (2Chron. 20:12).
3.  **Dependence** upon the Lord is the attitude for victory (2Chron.
    20:4).
4.  **Recognising** that the battle is the Lord’s is an essential in
    victory (2Chron. 20:15-17).
5.  **Worhipping** before the Lord is praising the Victor (2Chron.
    20:18-19).
6.  **Faith** in the Lord is assurance for victory (2Chron. 20:20).
7.  **Gladness** in the Lord is the result of victory (2Chron. 20:27).
8.  **Rest** in the Lord is another outcome of victory (2Chron. 20:30).

# 431. The Son of God

THE Son of God, in the First Epistle of John. Twenty-four times in this
Epistle is He said to be the Son of God.

1.  **What did God send His Son to be and do?**
    That we might live (1Jo. 4:9).
    To be a Saviour (1Jo. 4:14).
    To be a Propitiation (1Jo. 4:10).
    To destroy the works of the devil (1Jo. 3:8).
2.  **The result of believing in Him as the Son of God**
    We have eternal life (1Jo. 5:12).
    We know it (1Jo. 5:13).
    We have the witness (1Jo. 5:10).
    We are in Him (1Jo. 5:20).
    We know He has come (1Jo. 5:20).
    God dwelleth in us (1Jo. 4:15).
    We have the Father and Son (2 John 9).
3.  **The proof that we believe in Him as the Son of God.**
    Believe on His Name (1Jo. 2:23; and 1Jo. 5:13).
    Acknowledge Him as the Son (1Jo. 2:23).
    Confess Him as the Son of God (1Jo. 4:15).
    Have fellowship with Him (1Jo. 1:3).
    Continue in Him (1Jo. 2:24).
    That we know His blood cleanseth us from all sin (1Jo. 1:7).
    Overcome the world (1Jo. 5:5).
4.  **Those who disbelieve that He is the Son of God,**
    Make God a liar (1Jo. 5:10).
    Have not eternal life (1Jo. 5:12).

# 432. The Tempter

GENESIS iii

THE tempter used the serpent to tempt Eve, just as he used Judas to
betray Christ.

1.  **The tempter is subtle.** Thomas Watson says: “Satan did not break
    over the hedge where it was weakest; he knew he could more easily
    insinuate and wind himself about her by a temptation. An expert
    soldier, when he is to storm or enter a castle, observes warily
    where there is a breach, or how he may enter with more facility; so
    did Satan tempt the weaker vessel.”
2.  **The tempter questioning.** “Hath God said, &c.?” Bunyan, in his
    *Holy War*, speaks of one “Mr. Evil-questioning,” who was a
    Diabalonian, and an enemy of Man-soul. This man went by another
    name, viz., “Honest-inquiry,” but for all that, he was condemned and
    put to death. As the bait covers the hook, so the questions of Satan
    and his instruments hide the hook of doubt in the bait of
    questioning.
3.  **The tempter lying.** Said a quaint New England preacher, “Beware
    of Bible commentators who are not willing to take God’s words just
    as they stand. The first commentator of that sort was the devil in
    the Garden of Eden. He proposed only a slight change, just the one
    word ‘not’ to be inserted-‘Ye shall not surely die.’ The amendment
    was accepted, and the world was lost. Satan is repeating that sort
    of commentary with every generation of hearers.”
4.  **The tempter deceiving.** “Ye shall be as gods,” but Satan only
    presents one side. “Martha Browning, a young woman, aged 24, was
    executed many years ago for murder. The fatal deed was committed to
    obtain possession of a £5 note, but when the tempting bait was at
    last really possessed, it proved not a note of the Bank of England,
    but a flash note of the Bank of Elegance!”
5.  **The tempter cursed** (Gen. 3:14). God will not allow sin to go
    unpunished, either in the instrument or the one who uses the
    instrument. The serpent crawls along on its belly, and dust is to be
    its meat (Isaiah 65:25; Micah 7:17); and that old serpent the devil
    is thrust into the abyss during the Millenium (Rev. 20:2, R.V.), and
    ultimately into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10).
6.  **The tempter hurting.** “Thou shalt bruise His heel.” By these
    words we are told that Satan would injure Christ in some way. We
    know how effectually he succeeded in getting Christ to be crucified
    as a malefactor. The reviling, the suffering, the false accusation,
    and His being esteemed smitten of God and afflicted, tell out the
    malice of the enemy.
7.  **The tempter conquered.** “*He* (not *It*) shall bruise (crush) thy
    head.” Christ is the Seed of the woman (Gal. 4:4). Christ is the
    Stronger Man, who has overcome the strong one (Luke 11:21, 22).
    Christ has been the death of death by His death (Heb. 2:14); He has
    spoiled (stripped) all the hosts of hell (Col. 2:15), and undone the
    whole kingdom of Satan (1 John 3:8) for those who believe in Christ.

# 433. The Temptation of Jesus

MATTHEW 4:1-11

AFTER a time of blessing there comes a time of trial. It was after
Israel had come out of Egypt that they were met by Amalek (Exodus 17:8).
It is the same in Christian experience. When one has decided for Christ,
then begins the conflict with Satan. As long as we are his, he leaves us
alone, but as soon as we side with Christ, then he opposes us all he
can. Bunyan pictures this in Pilgrim’s Progress. As long as Christian is
in the world he is unmolested, but as soon as he seeks to enter the
wicket-gate then the arrows of the enemy are shot at him.

The temptation of Christ is threefold, and corresponds to the tempter’s
tactics with Eve in the garden of Eden.

1.  The first temptation relates to **Christ’s person.** Satan would get
    Christ to use His deity, to meet the need of His humanity. Satan had
    heard the voice from heaven acknowledging Christ as the Son of God,
    and now he says, “Being*the Son of God, it is an easy matter for
    You to make the stones into bread to meet Your hunger.” But if
    Christ had done so at the suggestion of Satan, it would have been
    distrust of God. Christ meets the enemy with the tried and true
    blade of the sword of God’s Word, and thus discomforts and defeats
    him. Satan cannot stand before the “It is written,” for that is a
    weapon which cuts through the toughest part of his armour.
2.  The second temptation relates to **Christ’s work.** Christ came to
    lay the foundation of a kingdom that should stand the test and
    stress of any power that might be brought against it. The first Adam
    lost his position and power by sin. The last Adam had come to gain
    them back again by His devotion to the Father’s will, in an
    obedience to the death of the cross. And as a result of that
    obedience, the Father would make the kingdoms of this world to be
    Christ’s in crowning Him King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev.
    11:15; 19:16). Satan offers to Christ without the cross the kingdoms
    of the world,\* but Christ scorns his offer, and meets him again
    with the keen sharp weapon of God’s truth.
3.  The third temptation relates to **Christ’s trust in God.** Satan
    takes our Lord and places Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple, and
    urges Him to cast Himself down, upon the plea that God will preserve
    Him from danger; but for Christ to do as He was bid, would be for
    Him to presume upon God’s mercy. As Godet says, “Satan seems to say,
    ‘1 Thou art a being to whom it appertains to call God Thy Father in
    an unique sense, do not fear to do a daring deed, and give God an
    opportunity to show the particular care He takes of Thee.’”\
     ….“This is very subtle-what was the real bearing of this
    temptation? With God, power is always employed in the service of
    goodness, of love; this is the difference between God and Satan,
    between divine miracle and diabolical sorcery. Now the devil, in
    this instance, aims at nothing less than making Jesus pass from one
    of these spheres to the other, and this in the name of that most
    sacred and tender element in the relationship between two beings
    that love each other-confidence. If Jesus succumbs to the temptation
    by calling on the Almighty to deliver Him from a peril into which He
    has not been thrown in the service of goodness, He puts God in the
    position of either refusing His aid, and so separating Christ’s
    cause from His own-a divorce between the Father and the Son-or of
    setting free the exercise of His omnipotence, at least for a moment,
    from the control of holiness-a violation of His own nature. Either
    way, it would be all over with Jesus, and, even, if we dare so
    speak, with God.”\
     It is of interest to note that Christ quotes from the Book of
    Deuteronomy each time He appeals to Scripture (Deut. 8:3; 6:13;
    6:16). “This book, which recorded the experience of Israel during
    the forty years’ sojourn in the desert, had perhaps been the special
    subject of Jesus’ meditations during His own sojourn in the
    wilderness.”\
     Gurnall well says, in speaking of the believer, like Christ,
    meeting the suggestions of the evil one with the Scriptures,
    “Provide thyself with Scripture answers to Satan’s false reasonings,
    with which he puts a fair colour on his foul notions, the better to
    gain thy consent. He is wily; thou hadst need to be wary. He not
    only propounds the sinful object, but sets a fair gloss upon it, and
    urges the soul with arguments to embrace his offer. And when sin
    comes thus forth Goliath-like, it is not Saul’s armour, but the
    smooth stones of the brook-not thy own resolution, but the divinity
    of Scripture argument that can preserve thee, or prostrate thy
    enemy. Now, thou wilt find in, the Word an answer put into thy mouth
    to repel all Satan’s sophistry. And this indeed, is to be an
    Apollos, mighty in the Scriptures, when we can stop the devil’s
    mouth, and choke his bullets, with a word seasonably interposed
    between us and the temptation.”

* * * * *

\* The words “1 Thou art the Son of God,” express something very
different from a doubt; this “*If*” has almost the force of “*Since*.”
“1 Thou art really as it seems,” &c. Satan alludes to God’s salutation
at the baptism.-*Godet*.

\* This is no idle offer. Billy Bray used to say of this offer of Satan,
“The old rascal, to offer Christ the kingdoms of the world, why he never
possessed so much as a tater skin.” But B.B. was wrong, for Satan is
called “The prince of this world” (John 12:31); “the god of this world”
(2 Cor. 4:4); “the prince of the power of the air” (Eph. 2:2). And these
are not meaningless and empty titles, but designations of his power and
place.


# 434. The First Disciples of Jesus

JOHN 1:35-51

As the sea is deeper the farther one advances into it, so the experience
of the disciples of Christ deepens as it goes on.

1.  **Looking to Jesus** (John 1:36). The message of John the Baptist
    is, “Behold the Lamb of God.” We must not forget that John had
    already spoken of Christ to his disciples as the Sin-Bearer (John
    1:29), and as the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit (John 1:33). John
    seems to say to his followers, “I pointed you to Jesus as the Lamb
    of God, and as the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit yesterday, and now
    to-day I direct your attention to the Person of Jesus as your
    Example in the character of the Lamb of God. See His lowly attitude,
    mark His loving manner, ponder His compassionate actions, note His
    spotless character, meditate upon His gentle love, muse upon His
    righteous life, behold His lovely Person, and imitate Him, and thus
    follow Him. But remember, that you must first have looked to Him as
    the One who has removed your sins from your conscience, on the
    ground of His sacrificial death, and have received from Him the
    Baptism of the Holy Spirit, before you will have power to follow
    Him. And remember, all this comes by beholding Him. Gaze upon Him
    till you become like Him, even as the flowers reflect the glory of
    the sun, being beautified by the colours that they draw from it,
    through their being in it, and looking towards it.”\
     The beholding that John enjoins upon his disciples is no passing
    glance, but as Godet says, “The word indicates a penetrating look
    which searches its object to its depths.”
2.  **Following after Jesus** (John 1:37). In the disciples of John
    following Jesus, we have an illustration of what follows looking to
    Him. They who look to Christ place themselves under the charm of His
    personal power, and are drawn after Him, even as the needle will fly
    to the load-stone the moment it comes under its influence.\
     To follow Christ means the denial of self, and cross bearing. It is
    reported of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, on being told “that if
    ever her son came to be an emperor he would be her murderer,” she
    made the reply, “I am content to perish, if he may be Emperor.” What
    she said vain-gloriously, we should be willing to say and do in
    following Christ-Perish the self-life, so long as Christ is Lord of
    our life, and the inspiration of our actions.
3.  **Abiding with Jesus** (John 1:39). Abiding with Christ is the
    result of following Him. To abide with Christ means to live in the
    consciousness of His presence, and to have fellowship with Him. We
    little know how much the desciples learnt during their stay with
    Jesus, but it must have been very precious, for “all the sweetness
    of a recollection was still living in the heart of the evangelist at
    the moment of his writing.” They who abide with Christ are sure to
    receive some hallowed revelation from Him, as the two disciples
    found, who were journeying to Emmaus, when in answer to their prayer
    “Abide with us,” He went in to abide with them (Luke 24:29, R.V.),
    and while in the house, at the evening meal, He made Himself known
    to them as He broke the bread and blessed it (Luke 24:30-32).
4.  **Testimony for Jesus** (John 1:41-45). Both Andrew and Philip bear
    testimony to having found the Christ, and invite Peter and Nathaniel
    to the One they have found. We little know the power of individual
    effort. Andrew brought Peter to Jesus, and Peter was used in one day
    in bringing 3,000 to Christ. Let the following table speak for
    itself. If one hundred believers were each to bring one soul to
    Christ in the course of a year, and each one brought to Christ was
    to bring one other to Him in the course of a year, how many would be
    converted in the course of twenty-five years?
    First year, 100.
    Thirteenth year, 409,600.
    Second year, 200.
    Fourteenth year, 819,200.
    Third year, 400.
    Fifteenth year, 1,638,400.
    Fourth year, 800.
    Sixteenth year, 3,276,800.
    Fifth year, 1,600.
    Seventeenth year, 6,553,600.
    Sixth year, 3,200.
    Eighteenth year, 13,107,200.
    Seventh year, 6,400.
    Nineteenth year, 26,214,400.
    Eighth year, 12,800.
    Twentieth year, 52,428,800.
    Ninth year, 25,600.
    Twenty-first year, 104,857,600.
    Tenth year, 51,200.
    Twenty-second year, 209,715,200.
    Eleventh year, 102,400.
    Twenty-third year, 419,430,400.
    Twelfth year, 204,800.
    Twenty-fourth year, 838,860,800.
    Twenty-fifth year, 1,677,721,600.

# 435. The Temptation of Jesus

MATTHEW 4:1-11

THE four “Thens” may be said to be like the four points of a compass.

1.  **The “then” of the Spirit’s leading.** “*Then* was Jesus led of the
    Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil” (Matt. 4:1).
    It was after the blessing that Christ received from His Father that
    He received this buffeting from the devil.\
     But, mark, the Saviour was led by the Holy Spirit to be tempted of
    the devil. God can make the devil to be a means of grace to us. As
    Trapp says: “The better to fit Him thereby for His ministry. Luther
    observed of himself, that when God was about to set him upon any
    special service, He either laid some fit of sickness upon him
    beforehand, or turned Satan loose upon him, who so buffeted him by
    his temptations, that neither heat, nor blood, nor sense, nor voice
    remained; the very venom of the temptations drank up his spirit, and
    his body seemed dead. Hence it was that in his sermons God gave him
    such grace that when he preached they that heard him thought his own
    temptation enabled them to be severally touched and noted.”
2.  **The “then” of Satan’s power.** “*Then* the devil taketh Him up
    into the holy city, and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the Temple”
    (Matt. 4:5). This is no mere figure of speech, but an actual
    reality, and goes to show in some measure the power that Satan has.
    One has only to call to mind the names and titles that are applied
    to him in Scripture, to understand the great power he has. Christ
    found the adversary no mean enemy with which to contend, neither
    shall we. Men often speak of Satan in contemptuous tones, but we
    should be careful lest we underrate his power, and thus give him an
    advantage over us. If he had the power to place Christ in a high
    place, and to tell Him to cast Himself down, and thus to presume
    upon His Father’s care, shall we say that he has less power with us?
    But mark, he has no power to cast us down; he can only suggest, as
    in the case of Christ. Matthew Henry says: “High places are slippery
    places; advancement in the world makes a man a fair mark for Satan
    to shoot his fiery darts at. God casts down, that He may raise up;
    the devil raiseth up that he may cast down: therefore, those that
    would take heed of falling, must take heed of climbing.” Satan only
    elevates that he may destroy. On the rocky shore of Cornwall may be
    seen the black cormorant seizing its prey, a shellfish, flying up
    with it into the air, and then letting it fall upon some rock, that
    the shell may be broken in pieces. Satan’s temptations are all on
    this principle.
3.  **The “then” of the Saviour’s answer.** “*Then* saith Jesus unto
    him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,” &c. (Matt. 4:10).
    Christ meets the temptation of the adversary each time by the sword
    of the Spirit. Trapp remarks: “This two-edged sword our Saviour had
    found to be metal of proof, and therefore holds him to it. Only the
    Scriptures scare the devil, as only faithful prayer can charm him
    (Isaiah 26:16). Prayer is called a charm. Athanasius writeth that
    evil spirits may be put to flight by that Psalm (Psa. 68), ’Let the
    Lord arise, and His enemies be confounded.’ But this is true of the
    whole Word of God, which is armour of proof against the devil.” We
    read that Oliver Cromwell had in his army one regiment-a fine,
    strong regiment-called “The Ironsides.” They were very religious
    men, and it was quite the custom for almost every soldier to carry
    his Bible to battle with him. They used to carry their Bible under
    their dress, and more than once, in a battle, the soldier would have
    been shot through the heart but for his Bible. The bullet went
    through the Bible, or it would have gone through the soldier’s
    heart. The Bible saved the heart. Even so with the Truth of God. It
    is the *armour* to protect from the fiery darts of the evil one; it
    is the *sickle* to cut down the tares that the enemy sows among the
    wheat of God’s truth; it is the *trumpet* to cause the walls of evil
    to fall before it, as the walls of Jericho fell before the blast of
    Israel’s rams’ horns; it is the *ark* to cause the dagon of iniquity
    to bow before it, and to topple to the ground; it is the *rapier* to
    pierce through the enemy’s armour; it is the *stone* to cause the
    Goliath of hell to fall to the ground; and it is the *sword* to cut
    through the devil’s devices.
4.  **The “then” of the serpent’s departure.** “*Then* the devil leaveth
    Him,” &c. Foiled at every point by the Lord, Satan retreats like a
    whipped cur. Trapp says: “1 Christ command him away, there is no
    abiding for him. Here he was foiled and quelled, and, as it were,
    cast down and killed, by Christ our Champion. He came into the field
    like another Goliath, cracking and calling craven, but ere he went
    thence was made to hop headless, as he first was a terror,
    afterwards a scorn, as it was anciently said of those chariots armed
    with scythes and hooks. Charles VIII., in his expedition against
    Naples, came into the field like thunder and lightning, but went out
    like a snuff, more than a man at first, less than a woman at last.
    Henceforth, therefore, though we are ever to expect temptations till
    such time as we have gotten that great gulf between the devil and
    us, yet fear none of those things that ye shall suffer.”

# 436. The Thirst of Christ

“I THIRST.”

1.  **He thirsts for admittance.** “Behold, I stand at the door, and
    knock” (Rev. 3:20; Solomon’s Song 5:2).
2.  **He thirsts for holiness.** “Bring no more vain oblations,” &c.
    (Isaiah 1:13-15).
3.  **He thirsts for love.** “And anointed the feet of Jesus” (John
    12:3).
4.  **He thirsts for prayer.** “Let Me hear thy voice” (S.S. 2:14).
5.  **He thirsts for listeners.** “Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,
    and heard His word” (Luke 10:39).
6.  **He thirsts for workers.** “Who will go for Us” (Isa. 6:8).
7.  **He thirsts for aid.** “Thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink” (Matt.
    25:42; Judges 15:18-19).

# 437. The Thorny-Ground Hearer

THERE are four ugly thorns that are mentioned in the different accounts
of the thorny ground hearer, any one of which would kill the good seed
of the Word, and these are “Cares,” “Riches,” “Lusts,” and “Pleasures.”

1.  **Cares** (Luke 8:14; Mark 4:19; Matt. 13:22). The Lord Jesus knew
    the engrossing and enslaving character of care, hence the repeated
    injunction which He gave in that memorable sermon of His, when He
    said, “Be not anxious for your life,” &c. (see Revised Version of
    Matt. 6:25, 27-28, 31, 34). When the mind is divided and distracted
    by anxiety, the attention is diverted from eternal realities.
    Anxiety is like a parasite which clings round a tree and destroys
    it, as when the ivy entwines itself round a young oak and eats all
    its life away by living upon it.
2.  **Riches** (Luke 8:14; Mark 4:19; Matt. 13:22). Riches in themselves
    are not an evil, when they are regarded as the godly merchant looked
    upon them. He said that he was “handling trust funds.” The evil is,
    when money is loved (1 Tim. 6:10), when we make “uncertain riches”
    (1 Tim. 6:17) the object of our trust instead of the Living God, and
    when they are a hindrance to following Christ, as in the case of the
    young ruler (Luke 18:23-24). “Riches are like thorns; they may be
    touched, but not rested upon. Canst thou set thy heart upon a thorn
    without piercing thyself through with many sorrows?” There is a
    story in Greek mythology which tells of one who lost the race
    because she stopped to pick up the gold which was thrown in her way.
    Ambrose says, “In gold there is a halter; in silver there is
    bird-lime; in the farm there is a bond; in the love of the world
    there is a chain; while we search for gold we are strangled; while
    for silver we stick fast; while we seize upon the farm we are taken
    prisoners.”
3.  **Lust.** “Lust of other things” (Mark 4:19). We need to remember
    that the word “lust” does not mean merely, that which is associated
    with uncleanness. Our word “desire” is more comprehensive, and is
    the thought that is signified here. To desire that which God forbids
    is sin (Gen. 3:6).
4.  **Pleasures** (Luke 8:14). It is related of Robert Burns that he was
    once under serious impression. He had times of serious reflection,
    as recorded by his own pen. He beautifully describes himself in the
    review of his past life as a lonely man walking amid the ruins of a
    noble temple, where pillars stand dismantled of their capitals, and
    elaborate works of purest marble lie on the ground overgrown by
    tall, foul, rank weeds. As Burns thought how this illustrated his
    own case he was filled with great alarm. The seed of the Word had
    begun to grow. He sought counsel from one called a minister of the
    Gospel. Alas, that in that crisis of his history, he should have
    trusted the helm to the hands of such a pilot! This so-called
    minister laughed at the poet’s fears, bade him dance them away at
    balls, drown them in bowls of wine, and fly from these phantoms to
    the arms of pleasure. Fatal, too pleasant advice! He followed it,
    and “The lusts of other things choked the Word.”

# 438. The Test

LINACRE, on his death-bed, took up a New Testament, and read the words
of the Lord Jesus, “Swear not at all” (Matt. 5:34). He immediately
closed the Book, with the exclamation, “Either this Book is not true, or
we are not Christians.” It goes without saying that the Book is true,
therefore, if men do not answer to its teaching, they must come to
Linacre’s conclusion-they are not Christians. An old writer has said,
“Christ is not only the *Root* from which we grow, but the *Rule* by
which we square.” What, then, is the test of a man being a Christian? In
answer to the question, let us take three “*I knows*” of the Apostle
Paul.

1.  **Consciousness of sin.** “*I know* that in me (that is, in my
    flesh) dwelleth no good thing” (Rom. 7:18). The first step towards
    being right, is to know that we are wrong; not merely that we have
    done wrong, but that the cause of wrong-doing is in the nature,
    which is altogether wrong. The fruit of the tree is bad because the
    tree itself is bad. The stream of the life is polluted because the
    source of the life-the heart-is defiled (Matt. 15:19). To know that
    we are lost, is the initiative to seeking that we may be saved. To
    see that we are under the curse, will urge us to crave the blessings
    of the Gospel of Christ. Do we know, in the Biblical sense of
    knowing, that we are sinful-that is, do we not merely know it in the
    head, but is it a thing we have realised in our heart, so that it
    has made us cry out, “O, wretched man that I am!”
2.  **Confidence in the Saviour.** “*I know* Him whom I have believed,
    and I am persuaded that He is able to guard that which I have
    committed unto Him against that day” (2 Tim. 1:12, R.V.).\
     There are many who know *about* Christ, but who do not *know Him*.\
     To know Christ as the *Saviour*, is to trust Him for salvation, and
    to deposit ourselves in His safe keeping, as the apostle says that
    he had done. To know Christ as our *High Priest*, is to be
    continually saved from sinning as we come to Him in faith and prayer
    (Heb. 7:25). To know Christ as our *Prophet*, is to be instructed by
    Him, and to sit at His feet even as Mary did (Luke 10:39). To know
    Christ as our *Lord*, is to recognise that we are His property, and
    to submit ourselves wholly to His rule (John 13:13-17). To know Him
    as the *Christ*, is to receive Him to live and reign in us
    (Galatians 2:20).
3.  **Conscience void of offence.** “*I know* nothing against myself” (1
    Cor. 4:4, R.V.). The apostle did not mean to say that he had no
    faults and failings. As Trapp well says, “Paul, a chosen vessel, but
    yet an *earthen* vessel, knew well that he had his cracks and his
    flaws which God could easily find out.” What the apostle said was,
    that as far as his consciousness went, he knew nothing against
    himself. To be able to honestly say this, there must be (1) implicit
    obedience to the Word of God, (2) initiation in the ways of God, (3)
    instruction in the will of God, and (4) intimate fellowship with God
    alone.

# 439. The Transfiguration

LUKE 9:28-36

THE scene on the Mount of Transfiguration lived in the memory of Peter
like a smouldering fire, for he referred to what he then saw years
after, and spoke of it as a picture of the coming glory of Christ in His
kingly majesty (2 Peter 1:16-18).

1.  **The privileged men** (Luke 9:28). As there are different circles
    among our friends, some more intimate than others, so there were
    different groups in relation to the disciples and Christ. There
    were, at least, three circles. The outer circle was composed of the
    seventy; the middle circle was composed of the twelve; and the inner
    circle was made up of Peter, James, and John. These three disciples
    saw the power of Christ when He raised the ruler’s daughter from the
    dead (Luke 8:51); they saw the agony of Christ in the garden of
    Gethsemane (Matt. 26:37); and they saw the glory of Christ on the
    mount. All believers may have the privileges of grace if they will.
    It is not a question of withholding on God’s part, it is a question
    of receiving on our part.
2.  **The praying Christ** (Luke 9:29). Luke makes special mention of
    Christ as a Man of prayer, and remarks that it was while Christ was
    praying that He was transfigured, as if the praying was the cause of
    the transformation. There is a moral transformation that the
    believer may know now (the same word rendered “transfigured” in
    Matt. 17:2, is translated “changed” in 2 Cor. 3:18), by prayerfully
    beholding the glory of the Lord; for as we prayerfully behold the
    glory of the Lord, we reflect His moral glory in our lives, even as
    the mirror reveals the face of the person who is looking into it.
3.  **The pressing topic** (Luke 9:30-31). The topic of the conversation
    that Christ had with Elijah and Moses was the “decease” that He
    should “accomplish at Jerusalem.” Moses represents the books which
    were written by him, namely, the Pentateuch, and Elijah represents
    the prophets; therefore, it is fitting that they should be with
    Christ and talk with Him about His atoning death, for the burden of
    their prophecies is the sacrificial death of Christ, as He Himself
    said when He journeyed to Emmaus with the two sorrowing disciples
    (Luke 24:27), and as He also stated to the disciples when He
    appeared to them in the upper room (Luke 24:44). There is no topic
    that is of such moment to heaven, of such benefit to earth, and of
    such dismay to hell, as the death of Christ.
4.  **The picture of the coming glory.** The transfiguration, as Peter,
    by the Holy Spirit, informs us, is a type of the coming glory and
    kingdom of Christ (2 Peter 1:16). The several persons named, are
    representative characters. Moses represents those believers who have
    fallen asleep in Christ, and will be raised when Christ comes (1
    Thess. 4:14). Elijah, who was translated to heaven without dying (2
    Kings 2:11), represents those believers who will be caught up to
    meet Christ in the air (1 Cor. 15:51), when He comes. Christ is the
    central figure, and speaks of the One who makes the believer’s
    glory, glory; and the three disciples on the mount, represent those
    who will see the glory of the heavenly saints, such as the Jews and
    the saved nations (2 Thess. 1:10; Rev. 21:).
5.  **Peter and the rest of the disciples asleep** (Luke 9:32). How much
    Peter and his companions lost of the glory through their sleepiness
    we are not told, but it is significantly said, “When they were awake
    they saw His glory.” They might have seen a good deal more if they
    had not gone to sleep. How much believers lose through
    soul-sleepiness! There are certain things to which we should always
    be awake, namely, to righteousness (1 Cor. 15:34), and to strength
    (Isaiah 52:1). To be awake to our privileges and responsibilities we
    are commanded (Rom. 13:11; Eph. 5:14).
6.  **The proclamation of the Father** (Luke 9:35). The proclamation is
    a commendation, and an exhortation. A proclamation of the worth of
    the Son, as the One who was specially beloved and delighted in, by
    the Father, and an exhortation for the disciples of Christ to “hear
    Him.”

# 440. The Twelve Sent Forth

MATTHEW 10:5-16

“AND as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand”
(Matthew 10:7).

There were nine things the apostles were to do, namely, “Go,” “Preach,”
“Heal,” “Cleanse,” “Raise,” “Cast out,” “Give,” “Salute,” “Shake off;”
and two things they were to be, viz.: “Wise,” and “Harmless.”

1.  **What the Apostles were to do.** 1 Christ’s instructions to His
    disciples we have an illustration of what all His people are to do.
    1.  **“Go.”** The disciples were restricted in the sphere of their
        labours. They were not to go to the Gentiles, but only “to the
        lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matt. 10:5-6); but believers
        are not so limited now, we are to go “into all the world” (Mark
        16:15), to “all nations” (Matt. 28:19), and to “the uttermost
        part of the earth” (Acts 1:8).
    2.  **“Preach.”** The disciples had to preach “the kingdom of heaven
        is at hand” (Matt. 10:7), that is, Christ coming as Israel’s
        Messiah and King. We, on the other hand, proclaim that Christ
        has come; hence our message is the Gospel of the grace of God.
        The essence of which is the death and resurrection of Christ (1
        Cor. 15:1-4).
    3.  **“Heal.”** “Heal the sick” was the commission of the twelve,
        but no man has the gift of bodily healing now, although God may
        heal in answer to prayer if it be His will. The spiritual health
        that Christ gives, as men come in contact with Him, is
        communicated to them as believers-being in touch with Him.
    4.  **“Cleanse.”** “Cleanse the lepers.” One line in the message of
        salvation is, that the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse from
        the leprosy of sin. Moral lepers are healed as we get them to
        come to Christ with the “1 Thou wilt” of expressed need, then
        they can hear Christ’s “I will, be thou clean” (Matt. 8:2-3).
    5.  **“Raise.”** “Raise the dead.” Those who are dead in sins (Eph.
        2:1) we may quicken as the message of John 5:24-25, is uttered
        in the power of the life-giving Spirit of God.
    6.  **“Cast out.”** “Cast out devils.” As believers are walking in
        fellowship with Christ, He will use them in casting out the
        demons that possess men; for God can still use us, if it be His
        will, as He used Paul (Acts 19:11-12).
    7.  **“Give.”** “Freely ye have received, freely give.” One rule
        that always holds good in the realm of Christ is, He gives that
        we may give. No believer must conserve to himself the blessing
        Christ gives, for it will be like the manna that was hoarded up
        by the Israelites if he does (Exodus 16:20). If we would have
        the cistern of our spiritual being ever full with the fresh and
        refreshing grace of God, we must take good heed that the tap of
        obedience, in seeking to be a blessing to others, is ever turned
        on.
    8.  **“Salute”** (Matt. 10:12). The salutation of the Christian to
        those with whom he comes in contact, should ever be, “Peace be
        unto you.” The best way to bring peace to any home or heart is
        to tell of Christ the Peace-maker (Col. 1:20), for those who
        believe in Christ have peace with God through Him (Rom. 5:1).
    9.  **“Shake off”** (Matt. 10:14). If there were any who would not
        receive the messengers of Christ, then they were to shake the
        dust off their feet and go elsewhere. Those who are most
        dependent upon God are the least dependent upon men. As in the
        days of the apostles, so now, there are ever those who believe
        and those who believe not (Acts 28:24).

2.  **What the disciples were to be.** They were to be “wise as serpents
    and harmless as doves” (Matt. 10:16). There was to be the simplicity
    of single-heartedness and the tact of godly wisdom. Thomas Watson
    says, “This beautifies a Christian, when he hath the serpent’s tooth
    in the dove’s head. We must have the innocence of the dove, that we
    may not betray the truth, and the wisdom of the serpent, that we may
    not betray ourselves. In short, religion without policy is too weak
    to be safe; policy without religion, is too subtle to be good. When
    wisdom and innocency, like Castor and Pollux, appear together, they
    presage the soul’s happiness.”\
     Wisdom is like the rudder of the ship, it keeps the vessel on its
    course; and harmlessness is like the sails, which, filled with the
    wind, propel the ship on its way.\
     To possess true wisdom, that which is not the wisdom of the old
    serpent, is to possess Christ, who is the Wisdom of God (1 Cor.
    1:24), and to be truly simple-not silly-is to keep in, what the Holy
    Spirit calls, “the simplicity that is in Christ” (2 Cor. 11:3), for
    we are in the Divine realm of His protection and power, as we abide
    in Him, besides having the special promise, “The Lord preserveth the
    simple” (Psalm 116:6).\
     The harmlessness of the dove is an illustration of the godly
    sincerity that should be the feature in the life of the child of God
    as he is in the world (Phil. 2:15, margin). To be simple concerning
    that which is evil (Rom. 16:19) is to be Christ-like, for He was
    “harmless” (Heb. 7:26), or “simple,” as the word is rendered in Rom.
    16:19.

# 441. The Word of Life

I. JOHN 1:1

THIS title seems to bring before us Christ as the Eternal One,
manifested to us on the ground of His death and resurrection by the Word
and Spirit of God, and to whom we are united by the power of the Holy
Spirit. The first Epistle of John speaks of-

1.  The manifestation of His life to us when we were born again (1Jo.
    1:2)
2.  Who is our Life? “The Son of God” (1Jo. 5:20).
3.  The character of our life-“eternal” (1Jo. 1:2).
4.  The gift of the life by the Father (1Jo. 5:11).
5.  The position He has brought us into-“out of death into life” (1Jo.
    3:14, R.V.)
6.  The knowledge of it through the Word of God (1Jo. 5:13).
7.  Where the life is-in Christ (1Jo. 5:11). Where the life is-in us
    (1Jo. 5:12).
8.  Who have the life-believers (1Jo. 5:12).
9.  Who have not life-unbelievers (1Jo. 5:12).
10. Future manifestation of it (1Jo. 2:25; Col. 3:4).

Let us remember Christ is our Life. He is the Prince of Life, let us be
ruled by Him; He is the Path of Life, to walk in Him; He is the Light of
Life, to look to Him; He is the Fountain of Life, to drink of Him; He is
the Bread of Life, to feed upon Him; He is the Tree of Life, to abide in
Him; He is the Word of Life, to rest in Him.
# 442. Things that Differ

IT is essential to mark the difference between salvation and service. To
note the blessings that are the gifts of God’s grace and those which are
the reward and outcome of service.

1.  **We do not run to be saved.** “It is not of him that willeth, nor
    of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy” (Rom. 9:16).\
     **We are saved to run** in the way of God’s commands. “Run with
    patience the race” (Heb. 12:1).
2.  **Salvation is not a prize to be gained, but a gift received.** “It
    is the gift of God” (Ephesians 2:8).\
     **We endeavour to gain the prize of the high calling of God.** “For
    the prize of the high calling” (Phil. 3:14).
3.  **To be accepted in the Beloved is an act of God’s favour.**
    “Wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved” (Eph. 1:6).\
     **To be acceptable (well-pleasing) to the Lord is the outcome of
    devotion to the Lord.** “Holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
    reasonable service” (Rom. 12:1).
4.  **To be made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light,
    depends on God’s action.** “Meet to be partakers of the inheritance
    of the saints in light” (Col. 1:12).\
     **But to be made meet for His service is the result of allowing Him
    to work in us and through us.** “God which worketh in you both to
    will and to do” (Phil. 2:13).
5.  **We do not strive for eternal life, for it is the gift of God.**
    “Given to us eternal life” (1 John 5:11).\
     **But we do strive for the victory to receive the overcomer’s
    crown.** “Receive the crown of life” (James 1:12).
6.  **We do not follow Christ to apprehend Him, that He may apprehend
    us.** “I am apprehended of Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:12).\
     **But we follow after, that we may apprehend that for which we have
    been apprehended of Christ Jesus.** “I follow after” (Phil. 3:12).
7.  **There is a difference between sonship and service.** As children
    of God, and as members of the body of Christ, we can never be
    castaways. “I am persuaded “none can” separate us from the love of
    God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:38-39).\
     **But as servants we may.** “Lest….I myself should be a castaway”
    (1 Cor. 9:27).

# 443. Things Which We Obtain by Faith

1.  **Salvation.** “By grace are ye saved through *faith*” (Eph. 2:8).
2.  **Justification.** “Being justified by *faith*, we have peace with
    God” (Rom. 5:1).
3.  **Introduction.** “By Whom also we have access by *faith*” (Romans
    5:2).
4.  **Adoption.** “For ye are all the children of God by *faith* in
    Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:26).
5.  **Sanctification.** “Sanctified by *faith* that is in Me” (Acts
    26:18).
6.  **Purification.** “Purifying their hearts by *faith*” (Acts 15:9).
7.  **Occupation.** “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by *faith*”
    (Eph. 3:17).
8.  **Progression.** “We walk by *faith*, not by sight” (2 Cor. 5:7).
9.  **Preservation.** “Kept by the power of God through *faith*” (1
    Peter 1:5).
10. **Expectation.** “We, through the Spirit, wait for the Hope of
    Righteousness by *faith*” (Gal. 5:5).

# 444. Thorny-Ground Hearers

MATTHEW 13:22

1.  **Orpah** (Ruth 1:15). Orpah’s decision was the result of impulsive
    feeing, of filial affection; it was strong suddenly, it grew up in
    an instant, and in an instant it perished.
2.  **Demas** loved the world (2 Tim. 4:10).
3.  **Simon Magus** was not real (Acts 8:21).
4.  **Hymenaeus** and **Alexander** made shipwreck of themselves (1 Tim.
    1:19-20).
5.  **Phygellus** and **Hermogenes** turned away (2 Tim. 1:15).
6.  The **rich young ruler** made enquiry, but got no farther (Luke
    18:23).
7.  **There were those who turned away from Christ** (John 6:66). These
    are compared to a washed sow which goes back and wallows in the
    mire; and to a dog which licks up his own vomit (2 Peter 2:20-22).

# 445. Three Appearings

HEBREWS 9:24-28

IT must be remarked that the words rendered “appear” in Heb. 9:24-28,
are three different words in the Greek.

1.  **The past appearing** (Heb. 9:26). Here the word “appear” means,
    for one to be seen who had been hidden, as when one comes from
    behind a curtain which had concealed him.
2.  **The present appearing** (Heb. 9:24). The term here indicates
    appearing in an official sense. Christ now appears in the presence
    of God, as the Representative of His people, to plead on their
    behalf, and to look after their interests.
3.  **The future appearing** (Heb. 9:28). Here it signifies to see face
    to face, as when Paul saw Jesus, when he was on his way to Damascus
    (1 Cor. 15:8).

# 446. Three Crosses of Calvary

THE men who were associated with Christ, are an object lesson for us, as
to the difference there is between the believer and the unbeliever in
relation to the question of sin. Let us look at the three men.

Upon the centre cross is Christ. Is there sin *in* Him? No. He did no
sin (1 Peter 2:22), He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21), and in Him was no sin
(1 John 3:5).

Was there sin *on* Him? Yes. For God made to meet upon Him the iniquity
of us all (Isaiah 53:6, M.).

Was there sin *in* the thieves? Yes. For they were, like all, conceived
in sin (Psalm 51:5).

Was there sin *on* the thieves? Yes, and no.

Upon the believing thief there was no sin, for Christ was his
Sin-Bearer.

Upon the unbelieving thief there was sin, for he did not look to Christ
for salvation from it.

  **Believing thief.**   **Christ.**         **Unbelieving Thief.**
  ---------------------- ------------------- ------------------------
  Sin *in* him.          Sin not *in* Him.   Sin *in* him.
  No sin *on* him.       Sin *on* Him.       Sin *on* him.
  †                      †                   †

The relation to Christ of the thieves made all the difference as to
their state before God. So is it now. They who believe in Christ have
their sins borne away by Christ (1 Peter 2:24), and those who do not are
rewarded according to their works (Rev. 20:12).


# 447. Threefold Death

DEATH, THE ISSUE OF SIN.

THERE is a threefold death as the result of sin.

1.  **Bodily death.** The common portion of man naturally, as a
    consequence of sin, is death (Heb. 9:27).
2.  **Spiritual death.** Sin has alienated man from God, hence man is
    dead in trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:1).\
     There are three illustrations given in the New Testament of
    spiritual death.
    1.  The prodigal was dead, as long as he was separated from his
        father (Luke 15:24).
    2.  The woman who lives in pleasure is dead, as long as she
        continues in a course of worldliness (1 Tim. 5:6).
    3.  Those who have a name to live, but who have not been quickened
        by the Holy Spirit, are dead in a spiritual sense (Rev. 3:1).

3.  **Eternal death.** “The second death” is eternal separation from
    God, from all that He is, and from all that He has to give (Rev.
    20:14).



# 448. Three Looks

MARK 10:17-27

WE have three looks in the verses before us-“Jesus beholding” (Mark
10:21), “Jesus looked” (Mark 10:23), “ Jesus looking” (Mark 10:27).

1.  **The look of love.** “Jesus beholding him, loved him,” &c. (Mark
    10:21). Love as embodied in Christ is seen in three attitudes.
    1.  *Love searches.* “One thing thou lackest” is the verdict of
        Love, as He listens to what the young man says he has done.
        Christ ever turns on the search light of His penetrating gaze,
        for His eyes are as a flame of fire (Revelation 1:14), that the
        weakness in the character may be made known, or that the hidden
        evil may be brought out into the light. See the “*I knows*” of
        Christ in Revelation 2 and 3 There were many things commendable
        about this young man, but the one thing lacking, spoiled all. As
        it has been said, “What then, did this young man lack? Not right
        desires: he wished to innerit eternal life. Not a good moral
        character: all the moral law he had kept from his youth up; he
        had been an honouring son, an honoured citizen, a pure man. Not
        earnestness: he came running to Christ. Not reverence: he
        kneeled before Him. Not humility: he made willing and public
        confession of his desire and his faith, before the multitude in
        the open roadway. Not an orthodox belief: if words are creeds,
        no creed could be more orthodox than that which he compacted
        into the two words, ‘Good Master.’ Not a humane and tender
        spirit: for Christ looking on him, loved him. But he lacked
        absolute and unquestioning allegiance, entire and implicit
        consecration; the spirit of the soldier who only asks what the
        marching orders are; the spirit of the Master Himself, whose
        prayer was ever, ‘Thy will, not Mine, be done.’ And lacking
        this, he lacked everything, and ‘went away sorrowful.’”
    2.  *Love demands.* “Sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
        poor.” The principle of this demand comes to all. As Dr. Lyman
        Abbot says, “It came to Luther when Christ bade him forsake the
        church of his fathers and of his childhood; to Coligny, when
        Christ bade him abandon his wife, and home, and peace; to
        William of Orange; to the Puritans; to John Howard; to David
        Livingstone.” In one form or another it comes to every
        Christian; for to every would-be Christian the Master says,
        “Give up your property, your home, your life itself, and take
        them back as Mine, and use them for Me in using them for your
        fellow men. He who cannot-does not-do this, is no Christian.”
    3.  *Love commands.* “Follow Me.”

2.  **The look of faithfulness** (Mark 10:23). As Christ saw the rich
    young ruler leaving Him, He looked round on His disciples and said,
    “How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of God.”
    Christ points to the retreating figure of the sorrowful rich young
    man, and in faithfulness reminds His disciples of the evil of
    riches. Old Humphrey says: “I was walking through an orchard looking
    about me, when I saw a low tree laden more heavily with fruit than
    the rest. On a nearer examination, it appeared that the tree had
    been dragged to the very earth, and broken by the weight of its
    treasures. ‘Oh!’ said I, gazing on the tree, ‘here lies one who was
    ruined by his riches.’ In another part of my walk, I came up with a
    shepherd, who was lamenting the loss of a sheep that lay mangled and
    dead at his feet. On enquiry about the matter, he told me that a
    strange dog had attacked the flock; that the rest of the sheep had
    got away through a hole in the hedge, but that the ram now dead had
    more wool on his back than the rest, and the thorns of the hedge
    held him fast till the dog had worried him. ‘Here is another,’ said
    I, ‘ruined by his riches.’”
3.  **The look of encouragement** (Mark 10:27). Impossibilities with men
    are possibilities with God. The disciples are dismayed and
    discouraged by the words of Christ, but He at once directs their
    gaze from themselves to God. From man’s standpoint it is impossible
    for man to span the great gulf which sin has made, but Christ has
    bridged over the impassable chasm by His death and resurrection, and
    now in His grace and love He says, “I am the Way,” and bids all to
    come to God by Himself (John 14:6).

# 449. Three Representative Women

THE three women are Dubious Orpah, Decided Ruth, and Disappointed Naomi
(Ruth 1:14-22).

1.  **Dubious Orpah.** Orpah started with her sister and mother-in-law
    from Moab, but she was easily persuaded to go back to the old
    country, the old sins, and idolatry. Her mind was never made up to
    go to the land of Israel, and she at once takes the bait when Naomi
    suggests that she and her sister should return, for it is but the
    expression of the desire that is in her own heart (Ruth 1:14-15).\
     Many, like Pliable in Pilgrim’s Progress, start well, but they soon
    go back.
    1.  The stony ground hearer received the word into his heart, and
        received it with joy, but he did not keep it there (Matt.
        13:20).
    2.  It is not profession, but possession that is the essential
        thing, as is illustrated in what Peter said to Simon Magus; the
        latter professed faith in Christ in baptism, but, as Peter
        looked through the window of his soul, he saw he had no
        possession of Christ (Acts 8:20).
    3.  The house of the soul may be swept with the broom of morality,
        and be garnished with the flowers of self-effort, but unless
        there is cleansing by the blood of Christ, and possession by
        Christ Himself dwelling in the heart, all else is vain (Luke
        11:25; Eph. 3:17).
    4.  To be associated with Christians as Demas was (Col. 4:14), is
        not sufficient; we must be associated with Christ, or we shall
        soon be llke Demas, and go back to the beggarly elements of the
        world, which we had professed to leave (2 Tim. 4:10; 2 Peter
        2:21). Beware of being like Orpah! She started well, but, alas,
        she soon went back. Continuance is the mark of discipleship
        (John 8:31), and the evidence of faith in Christ.

2.  **Decided Ruth.** Ruth stands in unmistakable contrast with her
    sister-in-law. The latter is like a piece of wreckage tossed about
    by the waves, while the former is like the limpet which clings to
    the rock. It is a very suggestive word that is used of Ruth in Ruth
    1:14, where it says she “clave unto her.” The word “*clave*” is used
    of the clods of earth which “*cleave fast together*” (Job 38:38); of
    the scales of leviathian, which are “*joined one to another*” so
    closely that no air can come between them (Job 41:15-17); to the
    bone which “*cleaveth*” to the skin (Job 19:20); in connection with
    one of David’s mighty men, to whose hand the sword “*clave*” when he
    had been fighting, so intense had been his grip in grasping his
    sword (2 Sam. 23:10); of Naaman’s leprosy “*cleaving*” to Gehazi (2
    Kings 5:27); of a girdle “*cleaving*” to the loins (Jer. 13:11); and
    of the Psalmist of whom it is said he “*followeth hard*” after the
    Lord (Psalm 63:8). From the use of the word “*clave*” we gather, how
    intensely in earnest Ruth was. There was no hesitation or
    vacillation about her. There was real grit and grip in her
    determination to go with Naomi, and to serve Naomi’s God. There must
    be the like spirit with all who serve Christ. When Barnabas went
    down to Antioch and saw the work the Lord had been doing, in the
    salvation of those who had believed in Christ, he exhorted them to
    *cleave* to the Lord with purpose of heart (Acts 11:23).
3.  **Disappointed Naomi** (Ruth 1:19-22). Naomi is typical of a
    backslider. She left her native land full, like many a believer who
    gets away from Christ when full of gladness and power, but she came
    back, or was brought back, “empty.” It is the same with the child of
    God when he gets out of communion. Naomi does not wish to be called
    “Naomi,” that is, “pleasant;” but, she says, call me “Mara,” that
    is, “bitter.” Bitterness of spirit is born of backsliding, and is
    always the outcome of departure from God. David found it so, when he
    cried for the restoration of the joy he had lost through his sin
    (Psalm 51:12). Peter had the same experience, when he went out of
    the Lord’s presence to weep, because of his denial of his Lord (Luke
    22:62). Naomi had to learn that the cause of her emptiness,
    bitterness, and affliction was found in her leaving the Lord. She
    had thought to obtain all she desired in Moab, but she got a worse
    famine there than in Bethlehem, for she lost husband and sons by her
    self-will. If we lie on the bed of roses which the world offers, we
    are sure to be pricked by the thorns on the roses. We cannot have
    the devil’s bait without the devil’s hook. The world offers gifts
    for its advantage, and not ours, however much they may seem to
    promise benefits.

# 450. Three Sights

LUKE 19:1-10

THE sight Zacchaeus saw from the sycamore tree; the sight that the
Saviour saw when He looked up and discovered the publican in the tree;
and the sight which the people had, when they saw Christ condescending
to be the guest of Zacchaeus.

1.  **The sinner’s sight.** “He sought to see Jesus” (Luke 19:3). There
    are many sights that the sinner seeks to have. Eve had a sight of
    the tree of knowledge, which led to her fall (Gen. 3:6); and Achan
    looked on the Babylonish garment and the wedge of gold, which led to
    his death (Jos. 7:21); but Zacchaeus saw Jesus and was saved.\
     There are many things said about this man in his desire to see
    Christ.
    1.  It was a sight attended with difficulty, for Zacchaeus was small
        of stature, and could not come near to Christ for the crowd,
        therefore he climbed up a tree. No one will be deterred by
        difficulty if he is truly in earnest about his eternal welfare.
        Difficulties are opportunities to evidence the reality of the
        seeker.
    2.  It was a sight associated with curiosity. He sought to “see who
        He was.” Better curiosity than indifference, for indifference is
        like a bog which swallows up everything, but curiosity is the
        road that leads to the glen of interest, where the flowers of
        grace shall fascinate and fix us to the spot.
    3.  It was a sight preceded by earnestness. We read that Zacchaeus
        “ran” and “climbed.” A spirit of determination prompted him to
        act as he did. Earnestness is like the steam in the engine, it
        causes one to move with haste.
    4.  It was a sight from a vantage point. The publican knew that
        Christ was to “pass that way.” There is one point of vantage
        where we may view Christ, and that is from the Word of God.
        Christ ever shows Himself through the lattice of the truth (S.S.
        2:9).\
         A sight of Christ is the best of all sights. A sight of Christ
        gives us:—
        -   A sight of ourselves (Job 42:5).
        -   Salvation (Isaiah 45:22).
        -   Gladness (John 20:20).

2.  **The Saviour’s sight** (Luke 19:5). The Lord Jesus looked up as He
    came to the sycamore tree, and saw the anxious enquiring man hid
    among its branches. The Lord Jesus never passed by a person who was
    really desirous of knowing who He was, and what His claims were. The
    eyes of the Lord are as a flame of fire to search us (Rev. 1:14),
    but they are also as doves’ eyes by the rivers of water (Song of
    Solomon 5:12). It is said that doves, when they drink water, do not
    look up till they have finished drinking. If this is so, it may be
    taken as an illustration of the fact that the Lord loves with an
    intensity that is eternal in its duration.
3.  **The people’s sight.** The people did not murmur as long as Christ
    was showing forth His power in miracle (Luke 18:43), but directly he
    went to be the guest of a man who was looked upon with contempt-for
    the tax-gatherers were oppressors of the people-then they began to
    grumble. It is the same to-day, many begin to grumble when they see
    one who has been noted for his wickedness converted to Christ, and
    if such a one is welcomed among God’s people, many of the latter,
    instead of encouraging the one who has believed, express themselves
    in a cold manner, by “hoping he will hold out.”\
     The people, if they had looked long enough and deep enough, would
    have seen in Zacchaeus a man who was-
    -   Called by Christ (Luke 19:5).
    -   Converted through Christ (Luke 19:9).
    -   Consecrated to Christ (Luke 19:8).
    -   Communing with Christ (Luke 19:7).


# 451. The Word of the Lord

THE servants of God are not to speak what they like, they are
commissioned to proclaim Christ. To proclaim Him:

1.  **In the saving of His grace.** “This is a faithful saying…Christ
    Jesus came into the world to save sinners” (1 Tim. 1:15).
2.  **In the strength of His power.** “It is the power of God unto
    salvation” (Rom. 1:16).
3.  **In the claim of His lordship.** “We preach not ourselves, but
    Christ Jesus the Lord” (2 Cor. 4:5).
4.  **In the sufficiency of His substitution.** “Preached unto him
    Jesus” (Acts 8:35).
5.  **In the forgiving of His love.** “Through this Man is preached unto
    you the forgiveness of sins” (Acts 13:38-39).
6.  **In the power of His resurrection.** “Preached through Jesus the
    resurrection from the dead” (Acts 4:2).
7.  **In the glory of His person.** “Teaching those things which concern
    the Lord Jesus” (Acts 28:31).
8.  **In the coming of His kingdom.** “This gospel of the kingdom shall
    be preached in all the world…then shall the end come” (Matt. 24:14).

# 452. Then

ADVERB of time, “*Then*,” in connection with Christ’s return.

1.  **In 1 Cor. 13:11-12, we have the “then” of perfect knowledge.**
    “Now I know in part: but *then* shall I know even as also I am
    known.” We do not know perfectly at present, for we see through an
    obscure glass, but when we are in the glorified state we shall see
    things with a perfect vision.
2.  **In 1 Cor. 4:5, we have the “then” of commendation.** “*Then* shall
    every man have praise of God.” The practical word to the Christian
    worker is, to “judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come.”
3.  **In 1 Cor. 15:54, we have the “then” of victory over death.** “So
    when…this mortal shall have put on immortality, *then* shall be
    brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in
    victory.” Meantime death swallows up those who come under its power,
    but there is a time coming when it shall be defeated.
4.  **In 1 Thess. 4:17, we have the “then” of union.** “*Then* we who
    are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
    clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.” With the loved ones who have
    fallen asleep, we shall be for ever with the Lord when He comes, but
    not till then.
5.  **In Col. 3:4, we have the “then” of glory.** “When Christ, who is
    our Life, shall appear, *then* shall ye also appear with Him in
    glory.” When Christ is manifested to the world in His resplendent
    glory, then we, with Him, shall be seen in the glory which He has
    put upon us.
6.  **In Matt. 25:1, we have the “then” of the end.** The Great
    Tribulation in relation to the Jewish people, who are likened to
    wise and foolish virgins. “*Then* shall the kingdom of heaven,” &c.
7.  **In 1 Cor. 15:28, we have the “then” of the eternal state.**
    “*Then* shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all
    things under Him, that God may be all in all.” Meantime Christ is
    seen as the Son, and will be seen as such through the Millennium.
    After the Millennium, His Sonship will be merged into the Godhead.

# 453. Things of Christ in Philippians

1.  **Day of Christ** (Philippians 1:10). Yet to come.
2.  **Gospel of Christ** (Philippians 1:27). To be preached.
3.  **Work of Christ** (Philippians 2:30). Our employment.
4.  **Knowledge of Christ** (Philippians 3:8). Our assurance.
5.  **Faith of Christ** (Philippians 3:9). Our study.
6.  **Apprehended of Christ** (Philippians 3:12). Our security.
7.  **Cross of Christ** (Philippians 3:18). Our suffering.

# 454. Towardness of Our Beloved

“I AM my Beloved’s, and His desire is toward me” (S.S. 7:10).

1.  **Peace towards us.** “Peace on earth, good will *toward* men”;
    (Luke 2:14).
2.  **Love towards us.** “God commendeth His love *toward* us&”; (Romans
    5:8).
3.  **Life towards us.** “In this was manifested the love of God
    *toward* us…that we might live through Him”; (1 John 4:9).
4.  **Mercy towards us.** “Great is Thy mercy *toward* me” (Psalm
    86:13).
5.  **Supply towards us.** “He hath abounded *toward* us” (Eph. 1:7-8).
6.  **Power towards us.** “God is able to make all grace abound *toward*
    you” (2 Cor. 9:8).
7.  **Kindness towards us.** “His kindness *toward* us through Christ
    Jesus” (Eph. 2:7).

# 455. Treasures of the New Testament

1.  **In Christ are found “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”;**
    (Col. 2:3). The red sardius of the blessing of His atonement, the
    green emerald of the power of His life, the blue sapphire of the
    heavenly gladness of His joy, the variegated agate of the many
    sidedness of His grace, and the flashing diamond of the glory of His
    coming, are all made known by Christ, and are found by us as we are
    in Him.
2.  **Israel is Jehovah’s peculiar treasure** (Exodus 19:5; Psalm
    135:4), which He found in the field of the nations of this world
    (Matt. 13:44), and for which Christ has given all He had (John
    17:5), in emptying Himself of His glory (Phil. 2:7, R.V.), and
    becoming poor (2 Cor. 8:9). This privilege now applies to the Church
    during Israel’s rejection (Ephesians 1:18-23).
3.  **The Gospel is a treasure.** The apostle, by the Holy Spirit, in
    speaking of the &“glorious Gospel,” says, we have “this treasure in
    earthen vessels” (2 Cor. 4:7). As the lights were in the pitchers of
    Gideon and his followers, and flashed forth to the discomfort of the
    Midianites (Judges 7:16-17), so the light of the Gospel of Christ,
    with which every true servant of Christ is entrusted, shall shine
    forth, as they live it truly and tell it out faithfully, and it will
    cause the darkness of sin to flee, the gloom of unbelief to be
    scattered, and the fog of iniquity to be gone.
4.  **There is treasure in the heart of every man** (Matt. 12:35). The
    treasure is either a blessing or a curse, according to its
    character. When it is the good treasure of the truth of God, then
    the life is beautiful with holiness, and fruitful with the graces of
    the Spirit; but when it is the evil treasure of the world, then the
    character is blighted by sin, and marred with iniquity.
5.  **Earthly treasure** (Luke 12:21). Thieves may steal it, moth may
    corrupt it, rust may spoil it, time will decay it, failure may take
    it, friends may borrow it, and death will say, “you must leave it.”
6.  **Heavenly treasure** (Matt. 6:20). This is enduring in its nature,
    incorruptible in its texture, safe in its keeping, heavenly in its
    origin, holy in its character, ennobling in its possession, and
    worth the having.
7.  **Treasures of wrath** (Rom. 2:5). The thunderbolts of God’s
    indignation against sin, the lightnings of His wrath, the fire of
    His judgment, and the putting forth of His power, are but slumbering
    till the self-willed sinner has filled up his cup of iniquity, when
    they shall burst upon him to his eternal shame, confusion, and
    punishment.

# 456. Trial of Abraham's Faith

GENESIS 22:1-14

There are several characters in which Abraham appears. Let us note them.

1.  **The Tried Believer.** “God did prove Abraham” (Gen. 22:1, R.V.).
    If the Lord gives us a special blessing, He will test our
    appreciation of it. If He places us in a position, He will prove our
    fitness for it. If He gives an Isaac, He will ask that that Isaac
    may be given to Him. “When a person took the first Napoleon a
    shotproof coat of mail, the Emperor fired many shots at it, while
    the inventor had it on. Finding it answer, the Emperor gave the
    maker a reward. Storms of trial, sacrifices to be made, obedience
    required, or loving services demanded, will test us. Constantine
    thus tested the Christians in his household when he required them to
    give up their religion under a heavy penalty. Those, however, who
    were faithful he took into his particular favour and service.”
2.  **The Responsive Saint.** “Behold, here I am.” When the Lord called,
    there was a ready response. Like Jacob (Gen. 46:2-3), Moses (Exodus
    3:4), Samuel (1 Sam. 3:4-6, 8, 10), and Isaiah (Isaiah 6:8), Abraham
    responds at once to the voice of the Lord. As the courtier stands in
    the Queen’s presence, ready to respond to the command of Her
    Majesty, so the believer should ever be ready to answer in willing
    obedience every command of the Lord.
3.  **The Loving Father.** “Thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
    lovest” (Gen. 22:2). The heart of Abraham twined round his son in
    holy affection, as the creeper clings to its support. This is the
    first time that the word “love” occurs in the Bible, and it is
    suggestive of that greater love that God had for Christ, of which He
    speaks in John 3:35. Mark how God speaks of Isaac—(1) “Thy *son*.”
    (2) “Thine *only* son.” (3) “*Isaac*.” (4) “Whom thou *lovest*.”
4.  **The Early Riser** (Gen. 22:3). Trapp remarks “upon Abraham rising
    early, to show his prompt and present obedience. He neither
    consulted with his wife nor with his own reason. She might have
    haply hung upon him and hindered him, as Zipporah did Moses, to the
    hazarding of his life (Ex. 4:25-26). He consecrates all the powers
    of the soul to his Creator.” The early seekers are sure to find the
    Lord (Prov. 8:17; Luke 24:22; John 20:1), and receive blessing from
    Him (Psalm 57:8-10; 63:1; 108:2), even as Israel found the manna
    every morning before the sun “waxed hot” (Exodus 16:21).
5.  **The Persevering Follower** (Gen. 22:4-5). For three days Abraham
    plods on in obedience to the Divine word, and there is no hesitation
    in following out its direction. An old writer tersely says, “We must
    not weigh the cross, for then it will prove heavy; we must not chew
    the pill, but swallow it whole, else it will prove bitter; we must
    not plod too much, but ply the throne of grace for a good use and a
    good issue of all our trials and tribulations.”
6.  **The Confident Answerer** (Gen. 22:8). When Isaac asks the question
    as to the lamb, Abraham confidently answers that God will provide
    it. The answer of the patriarch reminds us of Him who is “the Lamb
    of God.” Christ did not come and die to make God love us; it was
    because God loved us, that Christ came and died. The cause of God’s
    grace is in Himself, even as the electric light is caused by the
    generating power.
7.  **The Careful Priest** (Gen. 22:9). Everything is done in an orderly
    and careful manner. What a type this is of Christ as the sacrifice
    for sin! He came at the appointed time (Gal. 4:4). He died upon a
    cross—that it might be said He was pierced (Zech. 12:10; John
    19:37)—and not according to the mode that the Jews put to death,
    namely, by stoning; not a bone of His body was broken, that
    Scripture might be fulfilled (John 19:36; Exodus 12:46); and He was
    carefully placed in a rich man’s tomb that prophecy might be
    fulfilled to the letter (Isaiah 53:9; Matt. 27:57).
8.  **The Resolute Believer** (Gen. 22:10; Heb. 11:17-19). Who can tell
    the feelings of Abraham as he stands over his son with uplifted
    knife in hand? But he is in the line of obedience to God’s will, and
    he has faith in God’s power, even though he slays his son, that the
    Lord will raise him up to life. Faith looks not at consequences, but
    to God. “When the knife was up, the Lord came.” The Lord is never
    too late to aid His people.
9.  **The Waiting Servant.** “Here am I” (Gen. 22:11). No sooner does
    the Lord speak than Abraham responds, and stands in a waiting
    posture to hear what the Lord wills. Our safety and blessing are
    found in being attentive to the voice of God in His Word. The
    posture of young Samuel should ever be ours, namely, that of
    reverent, prayerful attention to the Lord.
10. **The God-fearing Man.** “I know that thou fearest God” (Gen.
    22:12). We are told how Abraham feared God, in that he was willing
    to give his son. All his hopes were centred in Isaac, but he yielded
    him at God’s command, and by so doing evidenced his faith. As James
    says, “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
    offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought
    with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?” (James
    2:21-22). As Canaan proved it was a “good land” by the fruit that
    came from it (Num. 13:23), so faith evidences its existence by its
    fruit. Faith receives God’s “All,” even Christ (John 1:12), and
    shows it has received Christ by giving the soul’s all to Him.
11. **The Obedient Offerer** (Gen. 22:13). At God’s bidding the ram is
    offered up in “the stead of Isaac.” What a type of Christ, who has
    been offered up in the stead of the believer! “He gave Himself for
    us.” Thus God answers Isaac’s question of Gen. 22:7, and illustrates
    His title of Jehovah-Jireh in Gen. 22:14.

# 457. Trinity

A SEVENFOLD light regarding the three Persons of the Godhead, is found
in connection with the following truths.

1.  **Death of Christ.** “How much more shall the blood of *Christ*, who
    through the eternal *Spirit* offered Himself without spot to God,
    purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living *God*?”
    (Heb. 9:14).
2.  **Resurrection of Christ.** “But if the *Spirit* of Him that raised
    up *Jesus* from the dead dwell in you, *He* that raised up Christ
    from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His *Spirit*
    that dwelleth in you” (Romans 8:11).
3.  **Christ preaching.** “The *Spirit* of the *Lord* is upon *Me*”
    (Luke 4:18).
4.  **New Birth.** “*Jesus* answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
    except a man be born of water and of the *Spirit*, he cannot enter
    the kingdom of *God*” (John 3:5).
5.  **Prayer.** “And *He* that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
    mind of the *Spirit*, because He maketh intercession for the saints
    according to the will of *God*” (Rom. 8:27).
6.  **Access.** “For through *Him* we both have access by one *Spirit*
    unto the *Father*” (Eph. 2:18).
7.  **Union.** “In *Whom* ye also are builded together for an habitation
    of *God* through the *Spirit*” (Eph. 2:22).

# 458. Twelve Apostles

MARK 3:13-19

THE Lord Jesus, in choosing and ordaining the twelve apostles, had a
six-fold purpose in view, as we are told in the following verses. He
chose them to, and for Himself (John 13:18; Acts 1:2), to be with Him,
to be sent forth by Him (Mark 3:14), to be separate from the world, and
to bring forth fruit (John 15:16-19).

Many of the names of the twelve men chosen are indicative of their
character. Let us note the meaning of the names, and one leading trait
in the life of the persons who bear them, as suggesting what we should,
or should not do, as believers in Christ.

1.  **Honoured Peter.** Peter was honoured, because that to him were
    given the “keys of the kingdom of heaven,” that is, not that he had
    or has the power to admit into heaven or refuse admission, but that
    he was privileged to open the dispensation of the Spirit to the Jews
    on the day of Pentecost, and to the Gentiles, as illustrated in the
    case of Cornelius (See Acts 10). Those who believe are also honoured
    in that they are privileged to proclaim the Gospel of the grace of
    God, and offer salvation to all who will believe in Christ.
2.  **Privileged James.** James, the son of Zebedee, was one of the
    apostles who was among the privileged three, the others being Peter
    and John. They were with Christ when He was on the Mount of
    Transfiguration (Mark 9:2); they were with Christ when He raised the
    ruler’s daughter to life (Mark 5:37); and they were also with Him
    when He went to the garden of Gethsemane (Matt. 26:37). Thus James
    was privileged to behold the glory of Christ, the power of Christ,
    and the agony of Christ. Those who believe in Christ have seen the
    agony of Christ, in that they have beheld Him by faith dying for
    them on the accursed tree; they have experienced the power of
    Christ, in that they have been quickened by His power from the death
    of sin; and they shall see the glory of Christ when He comes again.
3.  **Loving John.** John was loving because he was loved, and he was
    loved because he was loving. He was loving because he was loved;
    that is, he knew the love of Christ, and that was the constraining
    power which moved him to love others, even as the steam in the
    engine is the motor that moves the train. And he was loved because
    he was loving; that is, the love of Christ that acted through him
    drew others to him, even as the law of gravitation draws things to
    the earth.
4.  **Faithful Andrew.** The faithfulness of Andrew flashes out in more
    ways than one, but especially is it seen in his seeking out his
    brother Peter after he had found Christ for himself (John 1:40-41).
    A man who is full of faith is sure to be a faithful man, and his
    faithfulness will evidence itself in seeking the salvation of his
    own kith and kin, and telling them of the Lord who can save.
5.  **Friendly Philip.** Godet says: “It seems that Jesus was on terms
    of special cordiality with him.” This is borne out by Christ’s
    question in John 6:5, in the action of the Greeks who came to him
    when they would see Jesus, and in Philip’s question to Christ as
    recorded in John 14:8. He evidently was an approachable man. If the
    love of God is in the heart, the joy of the Lord in the countenance,
    and the peace of God in the mind, they will make a way to the hearts
    of others; so that we, in turn, shall be able to introduce others to
    Christ, even as Philip did (John 12:22).
6.  **Devotional Bartholomew.** “The name Bartholomew signifies son of
    Tolmai; it was, therefore, only a surname. It has long been supposed
    that the true name of this apostle was Nathanael, for in John 21:2,
    Nathanael is named amongst a number of apostles, which proves
    unquestionably that he was one of the twelve.” The devotional spirit
    is the one thing that Christ commends in him, as we read in John
    1:48. Prayer and praise are the lungs of the Christian life; but if
    we allow the congestion of neglect to set in, there will be pain and
    defeat. The prayer of faith is the inbreathing of God’s bestowed
    blessing, and the act of worship is the outbreathing of the soul in
    thanksgiving and praise to God.
7.  **Humble Matthew.** It will be noticed that the apostles are seen in
    pairs. Thus Matthew and Thomas are together. I draw attention to
    this fact for the simple reason that in the way he speaks of
    himself, without straining to do it, he brings out his humility. For
    instance, in Mark 3:18 the name of Matthew appears first; the same
    order also occurs in Luke 6:15; but when Matthew is recording the
    call of the apostles he puts the name of Thomas first. Again, Mark
    and Luke, in speaking of Matthew, simply call him “Matthew,” but
    when Matthew speaks of himself he calls himself “Matthew the
    publican” (10:3). The epithet would remind him of the old life in
    sin. While God in His grace calls us His “children” and “saints,”
    the humble soul always says “sinner” (1 Timothy 1:15).
8.  **Confessing Thomas.** In looking at the doubting of Thomas, we are
    apt to forget the confession of Thomas after he was convinced that
    Christ was risen from the dead (John 20:28). Trapp says of the
    confession of Thomas: “This is true faith indeed that individuates
    God, and appropriates Him to itself. Were it not for this possessive
    ‘mine,’ the devil might say the creed to as good a purpose as we. He
    believes there is a God and a Christ; but what torments him is, he
    can never say ‘my’ to an article of faith.”
9.  **Discriminating James.** This James is distinguished from James the
    son of Zebedee, by being called “the son of Alphaeus.” It is
    generally thought that this James is the one who is so often
    mentioned in the Acts and in the Galatians, as the brother of our
    Lord. He was the bishop of the Church in Jerusalem. It is in his
    address, as recorded in the fifteenth of the Acts, that his
    discrimination and holy common sense are seen (see Acts 15:13-21).
    To discriminate between God’s will and our own will, in
    whole-hearted obedience to the former, is the secret of joy; and to
    discriminate between the world and Christ, by being separated from
    the former to the latter, is the essence of holiness.
10. **Silent Thaddaeus.** Godet has well remarked upon the apostles
    about whom little is said: “All these men have had their share in
    the fulfilment of the apostolic task, the transmission of the holy
    figure of Christ to the Church through all time.” Many a Christian
    who has never been known, and whose name has never been mentioned,
    will be found to have fulfilled his mission in the day of Christ,
    even as the unseen stone is essential to the support of the
    prominent outside stone.
11. **Zealous Simon.** “The surname *Zealot*, given to Simon, is
    probably a translation of the adjective *kanna, zealous*.” To be
    zealous in good works is the best form of zealousness.
12. **Betraying Judas.** Even Judas fulfilled his apostolic function;
    his despairing cry, “I have betrayed the innocent blood,” is a
    testimony which resounds through the ages as loudly as the preaching
    of Peter at Pentecost, or as the blood of the martyr James. Let us
    be careful not to imitate the example of Judas in any way, and
    neither in work, look, nor action to deny our Lord.

# 459. Two Adams

SIN is the legacy that our first parents have left the human race.
Thomas Boston says: “God made Adam captain of the ship, in which were
all our goods, and he ran us on to the rocks and made shipwreck of us.”
Romans 5 reminds us that there are two great representative heads—the
first and last (not second, there is no other) Adam. We can gather what
we lost in the first, by pondering the following contrasts:—

  **In Adam**                  **In Christ**
  ---------------------------- --------------------------------
  Sin (Rom. 5:12) …            … Righteousness (2 Cor. 5:21).
  Death (Rom. 5:17) …          … Life (1 John 5:11).
  Banishment (Eph. 2:13) …     … Nearness (Eph. 2:13).
  Condemnation (Rom. 5:18) …   … Justification (Rom. 5:1).
  Curse (Gal. 3:10) …          … Blessing (Eph. 1:3).
  Judgment (John 3:36) …       … Deliverance (2 Cor. 1:10).
  Shame (Ezekiel 16:5) …       … Glory (John 17:24).
  Poverty (Isaiah 55:1) …      … Riches (2 Cor. 8:9).
  Sickness (Isaiah 1:5-6) …    … Health (Psalm 23:3).
  Defeat (2 Tim. 2:26) …       … Victory (1 John 5:4).
  Sorrow (Gen. 3:17) …         … Joy (Rom. 5:11).
  Weakness (Rom. 5:6) …        … Power (Phil. 4:13).
  Enmity (Rom. 8:7) …          … Oneness (Gal. 3:28).
  Bondage (Heb. 2:15) …        … Liberty (Gal. 5:1).

The above may be illustrated by taking two books and a card-one book
representing Adam, and the other representing Christ. Put the card in
the book Adam, and then put it in the book Christ.

“Scripture bears witness, with the vast experience of mankind, to the
depravity of men, and to their distortion universally (1 Kings 8:46;
Psalm 51:5; 143:2; Jer. 17:9; Matt. 7:11; Rom. 3:19-20; Eph. 2:1-3).”
The Chinese moralists teach that “man is born good.” Yet an ancient
Chinese proverb speaks of “two good men—one dead, the other unborn;”
which is another way of saying, “there are none good.”

The Fall was the key that unlocked the flood-gates of evil, and allowed
the waters of iniquity to cut us off from God; the fall was the fatal
touch that imparted to our nature the disease of sin; the fall was the
hand that dropped into our cup the poison of iniquity; the fall was the
robber that robbed us of the blessings of Paradise; the fall was the
rust that corrupted the nature of man; the fall was the blight that
marred God’s fair creation; and the fall was the depositor of all the
germs of evil in our nature. Watson says, “Let us lay to heart original
sin, and be deeply humbled by it. It cleaves to us as a disease, it is
an active principle in us, stirring us up to evil. Some think, as long
as they are civil, they are well enough; ay, but the nature is poisoned.
A river may have fair streams, but vermin in the bottom.”
# 460. Two Followings

1.  **Coldness.** “And Peter followed afar off” (Luke 22:54). This is
    one of the seven downward steps in the fall of Peter. The first was
    self-confidence; the second was sleeping instead of watching; the
    third was doing what he had no authority to do, namely, cutting off
    the ear of the servant of the high priest; the fourth was following
    afar off; the fifth was sitting down in the company of the ungodly;
    the sixth was denying his Master; and the seventh was denying Him
    with oaths and curses (Luke 22:33, 45, 50, 54, 55, 57; Matt. 26:72,
    74). Beware of the first step, for it leads to all the rest.
2.  **Cleaving.** “My soul followeth hard after Thee” (Ps. 63:8), or as
    it might be rendered, “is glued to Thee.” The Hebrew word rendered
    “followeth” here is the same as is rendered in Gen. 2:24, “cleave”;
    in Ruth 1:14 “clave”; in Psalm 119:31 “stuck”; in Jeremiah 42:16,
    “follow close”; in Job 41:17 “joined”; and in Gen. 31:23 “overtook.”
    Now if we look at the above Scriptures, we find the following
    thoughts:—Affection, devotion, faithfulness, attention, oneness, and
    earnestness. If we are following hard after the Lord there will be:—
    1.  Affection for Him.
    2.  Devotedness to Him.
    3.  Faithfulness to Him.
    4.  Attention to Him.
    5.  Oneness with Him.
    6.  Earnestness of aim to be near Him.

    “Hard after Thee.” As the sheep follows the shepherd; as the student
    his studies; as the business man his business; as the athlete for
    the prize; as the bird after its food; and as a hunter after the
    prey.\
     “Thee.” Not theories, not dogmas, not self, not the world, or
    pleasure, but Thee, Thee alone, and Thee always.

# 461. Two Siftings

1.  **Subtleness.** “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
    you, that he may sift you as wheat” (Luke 22:31). Satan sifts to get
    rid of the wheat. Beware of the Devil’s riddle.
2.  **Searching.** “I will sift the house of Israel among all nations,
    like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain
    fall upon the earth” (Amos 9:9). The Lord will bring Israel to
    Himself yet, but we may apply this to ourselves now. The Lord puts
    us in the sieve of chastisement, the sieve of trial, the sieve of
    humiliation, the sieve of difficulty, the sieve of disappointment,
    the sieve of persecution, and the sieve of wake-up-edness. What for?
    To get rid of the wheat? No; but to get rid of the chaff of pride,
    worldliness, sloth, and unbelief.

# 462. Two Wants

1.  **Penury.** “Began to be in want” (Luke 15:14). Notice the downward
    steps of the prodigal:—
    1.  His discontent. “;Give me the portion of goods that falleth to
        me.”
    2.  His distance. “Took his journey into a far country.”
    3.  His dissipation. “There wasted his substance in riotous living.”
    4.  His destitution. “And when he had spent all, there arose a
        mighty famine in that land.”
    5.  His distress. “He began to be in want.”
    6.  His disgrace. “Joined himself to a citizen of that country, and
        he sent him into his fields to feed swine.” Thomas Fuller says,
        “He came from the keeping of harlots to the minding of the
        hogs.”
    7.  His dismay. “I perish with hunger.”

    It is to the fifth downward step we draw attention now, viz., his
    distress or penury. “He began to be in want.” The word “*hustereo*,”
    translated “*want*” in the above passage, is rendered in Romans
    3:23, “*short*;” in Phil. 4:12, “*suffer*;” and in Heb. 11:37,
    “*destitute*.” The meaning of the word is, to be behind, to be
    lacking, to fall short, to be last or inferior. Now, if we bear this
    in mind, and look at the Scriptures where this word occurs, we see
    the prodigal’s condition portrays to the letter the condition of the
    sinner. Coming short of God’s glory, we are bound to suffer need,
    that brings us into a state of destitution, and thus we are sure to
    be in want. He that wants Christ lacks everything; he that has
    Christ needs nothing.
2.  **Plenty.** “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want” (Psalm
    23:1). It has often been noticed that six of the titles of Jehovah
    are illustrated in this Psalm, but all ten of the titles may be
    seen.
    1.  *Jehovah-Rohi.* “Jehovah, my Shepherd” (Psalm 23:1). What a
        Shepherd He is! The Good Shepherd who died; God’s Shepherd to
        bear His wrath; the Great Shepherd who rose again; the One
        Shepherd over His flock; the Chief Shepherd, who is coming
        again; and last, but not least, the believer can say, “My
        Shepherd.”
    2.  *Jehovah-Jireh.* “The Lord will provide” (Gen. 22:14 M.). “I
        shall not want.” He has provided for our need as sinners in the
        death of Christ. He provides for our need as saints in the Risen
        Christ. He provides for our need as servants by His Word and
        Spirit. He provides for our need as warriors in the Truth. And
        when He comes again, He will provide for us for ever.
    3.  *Jehovah-Shalom.* “Jehovah, send peace” (Judges 6:24). “He
        maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside
        the still waters.” He provides rest and refreshment, provender
        and peace; He does it all. We have to be careful for nothing,
        prayerful about everything, and thankful for anything.
    4.  *Jehovah-Tsebahoth.* “Jehovah of hosts” (1 Samuel 1:3, &c.). “He
        leadeth me.” He goes before; ours it is to follow. He directs;
        ours it is to obey. He guides; ours it is to be led.
    5.  *Jehovah-Ropheca.* “Jehovah that healeth thee” (Ex. 15:26). “He
        restoreth my soul,” &c. He renews our strength. He brings us
        back if we wander, forgives our backsliding, and heals us of the
        causes of it.
    6.  *Jehovah-Tsidkenu.* “The Lord our Righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6;
        33:16). “He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness.” He has
        put us right before God. He is our Righteousness, and He keeps
        us right before men.
    7.  *Jehovah-Shammah.* “Jehovah is there” (Ez. 48:35). “Thou art
        with me.” With us to sustain, comfort, succour, cheer,
        sympathize, defend, save, keep, sanctify, and bless.
    8.  *Jehovah-Nissi.* “Jehovah my Banner” (Exodus 17:15). “Thou
        preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.” He
        is the Captain who never lost a battle. He feasts us in the
        sight of our foes; He furnishes with armour for the conflict;
        and fits us for the fray.
    9.  *Jehovah-Mekaddeshcem.* “Jehovah that doth sanctify you.” (Ex.
        31:13). If we spell holiness with five letters-Jesus-we shall
        find that they will be like David’s five smooth stones taken out
        of the brook, and slung in the strength of God, will kill any
        giant that we may meet.
    10. *Jehovah-Heleyon.* “Jehovah most high” (Psalm 7:17) "Dwell in
        the house of the Lord for ever.”


# 463. Typical Colours

Exodus 25:3-7

THE different things brought by the children of Israel represent the
glory of the person and work of Christ.

As the children of Israel brought the different things to the Lord for
the tabernacle, so we may bring spiritual sacrifices to Him, praising
Him for all that He has revealed Himself to be in the Person and work of
His Son, for having revealed Christ in us, and praying Him to reveal the
moral beauties of the Person of Christ through us in our life, that
glory may be brought to Him thereby.

**Gold** represents the divine glory of the Lord Jesus as the Son of
God, and also the Lord Jesus as the Righteousness of God (Canticles
5:11).

**Silver** represents Christ in the value of His person atoning for sin,
and the result of it to us, viz., redemption (1 Peter 1:18; Exodus
30:11-16).

**Bronze or brass** represents Him enduring the fire of God’s judgment
against sin (Revelation 1:15; John 3:14).

**Blue** is the heavenly colour, and represents Him as the Heavenly One
in the beauty of His person, dispensing heavenly blessings (Exodus
24:10; Ezekiel 1:26).

**Purple** is the royal colour, and represents Him as the Lord and King
(Judges 8:26; John 19:2, 5).

**Scarlet** represents Jesus as the suffering One; and as the glorified
One—“ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to have entered
into His glory?” (Heb. 9:19; Matt. 27:28).

**Fine linen or silk** (margin) represents Him as the spotless Son of
Man in His person and ways (Rev. 15:6; 19:8; 1 Pet. 1:19).

**Goats’ Hair.** This seems to have a double meaning: *first*, it is the
memorial of Jesus as the Sin Bearer, from the fact that the goats’ hair
covering of the tabernacle was bigger than the other coverings, the
extra piece being doubled and hung down in front of the tabernacle
(Exodus 26:7, 9; 2 Cor. 5:21); for it was a goat that was slain on the
day of atonement as a sin offering (Lev. 16:15), thus the goats’ hair
covering would remind the children of Israel of the slain goat.
*Second*, the hair has reference to separation, from the fact that the
Nazarite was to let his hair grow long, and it would thus represent
Jesus as separate from all outward evil and sin (Hebrews 7:26).

**Rams’ Skins Dyed Red,** which represents Christ’s obedience unto
death, even the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8).

**Badger Skins,** which represents the outward appearance of Christ to
the world. They could not appreciate the beauty of His Person and His
perfect holiness. He was to them as a Root out of a dry ground, without
form or comeliness (Isaiah 53:2).

**Shittim Wood,** which represents Christ’s holy humanity (Luke 1:35).

**Oil for the Light,** which represents Christ in the power of the
Spirit testifying to the glory of God (Acts 10:38).

**Spices for the Anointing Oil,** which represent Christ acting in the
power of the Spirit in His life, death, and resurrection, and the
fragrance that went up to the Father as He did so (John 8:29).

**Sweet Incense.** Christ’s intercession for us now (Rom. 8:34).

**Onyx Stones.** Job speaks of the precious onyx stone (Job 28:16),
therefore this represents Christ as the precious One—“Unto you,
therefore, which believe He is precious” (1 Peter 2:7).

**Stones for the Ephod and Breastplate.** The moral glories and beauty
of the Person of Christ (Canticles 5:10-16).
# 464. Understanding Heart

An understanding heart is a—

1.  **Christ-knowing Heart.** “That we may know Him that is true” (1
    John 5:20).
2.  **Truth-enlightened Heart.** “The eyes of your understanding being
    enlightened” (Ephesians 1:18).
3.  **Christ-instructed Heart.** “Then opened He their understanding”
    (Luke 24:45).
4.  **Faith-influenced Heart.** “Through faith we understand that the
    worlds were framed by the Word of God” (Heb. 11:3).
5.  **Bible-loving Heart.** “Daniel understood by books” (Daniel 9:2).
6.  **Word-keeping Heart.** “That I may live, and keep Thy Word” (Psalm
    119:17).
7.  **Grace-taught Heart.** “The Lord give thee understanding in all
    things” (2 Timothy 2:7).

# 465. Unfailing Things

THINGS that have to do with man fail, but the things which have to do
with God, are like Himself—unfailing (Zeph. 3:5).

Things which do not fail—

1.  **The Lord’s Presence.** “The Lord thy God, He it is that doth go
    with thee; He will not *fail* thee” (Deut. 31:6).
2.  **The Lord’s Faithfulness.** “Nor suffer My faithfulness to *fail*”
    (Psalm 89:33).
3.  **The Lord’s Compassions.** “His compassions *fail* not”
    (Lamentations 3:22).
4.  **The Lord’s Care.** “Neither shall the cruise of oil *fail*” (1
    Kings 17:14).
5.  **The Lord’s Law.** “It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than
    one tittle of the law to *fail*‟ (Luke 16:17).
6.  **The Lord’s Christ.** “Thy years shall not *fail*” (Heb. 1:12).
7.  **The Lord’s Promise.** “There *failed* not ought of any good thing
    which the Lord had spoken” (Joshua 21:45).
8.  **The Lord’s Love.** “Love never *faileth*” (1 Cor. 13:8., R.V.).
9.  **The Lord’s Stars.** “Not one *faileth*” (Isaiah 40:26).

# 466. Unfaithfulness

1.  **Unfaithfulness is the Forerunner of Defeat,** as seen in the case
    of Achan touching the consecrated wealth (Joshua 7:).
2.  **Unfaithfulness is the Extinguisher of Testimony,** as indicated in
    Christ‖s threat to the Church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:5).
3.  **Unfaithfulness means the Rod of Chastisement,** as is evidenced in
    the Lord’s action to the chastised in the Church at Corinth (1
    Corinthians 11:30-32).
4.  **Unfaithfulness means Loss of Power,** as illustrated in the lack
    of Church discipline in the case of the Church at Corinth, when they
    allowed the leaven of evil to be in their midst unjudged (1
    Corinthians 5).
5.  **Unfaithfulness is the Cup of Bitterness** which we fill for our
    own drinking, as is exhibited in King Saul when he failed to carry
    out the Divine behest in the utter destruction of Amalek (1 Samuel
    15).
6.  **Unfaithfulness is the Napkin of Laziness,** like the man who
    wrapped his talent in a napkin, and was punished for his wilful
    neglect (Matthew 25:30).
7.  **Unfaithfulness is the Sapper of Judgment** which undermines the
    house of the unfaithful one, and brings it down upon him to his
    destruction, as is illustrated in the house of Eli (1 Sam. 2:27-36).

# 467. Unity

THE secret of the blessing the early Christians enjoyed, and the power
they were for good, may be summed up in one word—“Unity.” This is seen
in connection with those trite and telling words, “One accord,” which
occur again and again in the Acts. Mark “Accord,” not “Discord.” The
Church should be like a well-tuned harp, upon which the Master of
Assemblies can play the melodies of righteousness and holiness of life,
love to each other, and glory to God in the highest.

1.  **Unity in Prayer.** “These all continued with *one accord* in
    prayer and supplication” (Acts 1:14).
2.  **Unity in Obedience.** “They were all with *one accord* in one
    place” (Acts 2:1).
3.  **Unity of Presence.** “They were all with *one accord* in one
    place” (Acts 2:1).
4.  **Unity of Purpose.** “Continuing daily with *one accord* in the
    temple.” “Praising God” (Acts 2:46-47).
5.  **Unity in Praise.** “Lifted up their voice to God with *one
    accord*” (Acts 4:24).
6.  **Unity in Service.** “They were all with *one accord* in Solomon’s
    porch“ (Acts 5:12).
7.  **Unity in recognizing God’s Servants.** “It seemed good unto us,
    being assembled with *one accord*, to send chosen men unto you, with
    our beloved Barnabas and Paul” (Acts 15:25).

# 468. Unsurpassed Glory of the Lord

1.  **His Ways are Untrackable.** “His ways past finding out” (Romans
    11:33).
2.  **His Riches are Unsearchable.** “The unsearchable riches of Christ”
    (Ephesians 3:8).
3.  **His Love is Unknowable.** “The love of Christ which passeth
    knowledge” (Ephesians 3:19).
4.  **His Joy is Unspeakable.** “Joy unspeakable, and full of glory” (1
    Peter 1:8).
5.  **His Goodness is Unsurpassable.** “Behold therefore the goodness…of
    God” (Romans 11:22).
6.  **His Peace is not Understandable.** “Peace of God, which passeth
    all understanding” (Philippians 4:7).
7.  **He Himself is Indescribable.** “He is altogether lovely”
    (Canticles 5:16).

# 469. Unto Him

1.  **Gathering.** Unto Him let us gather. “*Unto Him* shall the
    gathering of the people be” (Genesis 49:10).
2.  **Listening.** Unto Him let us listen. “Then drew near *unto Him*
    all the publicans and sinners for to hear Him” (Luke 15:1).
3.  **Coming.** Unto Him let us bring everything. “Mary was come…*unto
    Him*” (John 11:32).
4.  **Suffering.** Unto Him let us go outside the camp bearing His
    reproach. “Let us go forth therefore *unto Him* without the camp,
    bearing His reproach” (Hebrews 13:13).
5.  **Living.** Unto Him let us live. “Should not henceforth live unto
    ourselves, but *unto Him*” (2 Corinthians 5:15).
6.  **Looking.** Unto Him that is able to do, let us look. “*Unto Him*
    that is able to do exceeding abundantly” (Ephesians 3:20).
7.  **Glory** unto Him we shall soon be gathered in the glory. “By our
    gathering together *unto Him*” (2 Thessalonians 2:1).\
     And our song then, as now, shall be, “*Unto Him* be glory”
    (Ephesians 3:21).

# 470. “Upon”

THE Gospel according to “*Upon*,” that is, as revolving around the
preposition “*Epi*,” is full of instruction.

1.  **The Substitute upon the Tree frees the Believer from sin’s
    consequences.** “Bare our sins in His own body *on* (Epi) the tree”
    (1 Peter 2:24).
2.  **The Righteousness of God upon the Believer makes him beautiful.**
    “*Upon* all them that believe” (Rom. 3:22).
3.  **Being built on Christ, the Foundation makes the Believer to
    partake of His life.** “Build *upon* this foundation” (1 Corinthians
    3:12).
4.  **To cast all care upon the Lord is the Believer’s Privilege.**
    “Casting all your care *upon* Him” (1 Peter 5:7).
5.  **The Spirit of God resting upon the Believer is his Glory and
    Power.** “Spirit of God resteth *upon* you” (1 Peter 4:14).
6.  **The Power of Christ upon the Believer, is the Strengthener for
    every trial.** “Power of Christ may rest *upon* me” (2 Corinthians
    12:9).
7.  **The Grace of the Holy Spirit upon the Believer is the Outcome of
    Whole-hearted Surrender to Him.** “Great grace was *upon* them all”
    (Acts 4:33).

# 471. Upper-Room Meetings

THE “upper room” in Jerusalem was a place which was memorable because of
what occurred there. It was in the upper room that Christ uttered those
words which we have recorded in the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th chapters
of John. I remember a good brother at a prayer meeting in Peterhead, in
the north of Scotland, praying for a mission, which was to be conducted
by myself, asking that we might have “upper room meetings.” I quickly
responded “Amen!”

What kind of meeting did Christ have in the upper room? The following
seven P’s will indicate what is associated with the meeting of Christ
and His disciples in the upper room.

1.  **Promise** of Christ’s return (John 14:1-7).
2.  **Presence** of the Holy Spirit to comfort and help (John 14:16-26).
3.  **Peace** of Christ to calm and still (John 14:27).
4.  **Progress** in fruit-bearing through abiding in Christ (John
    15:1-17).
5.  **Persecution** from the world through our association with Christ
    (John 15:18-25).
6.  **Power** of the Holy Spirit through the believer, convicting of sin
    (John 16:7-14).
7.  **Prayer** of Christ for His people; an illustration of what He is
    doing at present (John 17).

# 472. Walk

THOSE who are saved by Christ, endeavour to fulfil His commands to—

1.  **Walk in Love.** “*Walk* in love, as Christ also hath loved us”
    (Ephesians 5:2).

4.  **Walk by faith.** “We *walk* by faith” (2 Cor. 5:7).
5.  **Walk in Newness of Life.** “*Walk* in newness of life” (Romans
    6:4).
6.  **Walk Honestly.** “Let us *walk* honestly” (Rom. 13:13).

4.  **Thoroughly.** In the truth (2 John 4).

6.  **Dependently.** In the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, 25).
7.  **Submissively.** In the Lord (Colossians 2:6).

# 474. Watchfulness

MATTHEW 24:42-51

THERE are many things against which we should watch. We should watch
ourselves, lest any evil arise and hurt our life (1 Thess. 5:6). We
should watch against the enemy of our souls, who prowls about like an
evil beast in search of prey (1 Peter 5:8). We should watch against the
allurements of the world, which will fascinate the soul like the
boa-constrictor does the bird, when it is held by the gaze of the
serpent; and we should watch for Christ, as the watcher guards the city,
for Christ may come at any time, and it becomes us to be ready.

1.  **We should watch for Christ, because of the Person who commands us
    to do so.** “Your *Lord*” (Matt. 24:42). One of the forgotten truths
    of today, is the Lordship of Christ. His Lordship reminds us of His
    right to us, for we are His by purchase (1 Corinthians 6:20), and
    purpose (Ephesians 1:4). Christ as our Lord tells us of His claim
    upon us, for since we are His we have no right to ourselves;
    therefore, His will should be our delight (Psalm 40:8), His word our
    law (Psalm 119:44), and His way our pattern (1 Peter 2:21). Further,
    Christ as Lord speaks of our being His bond servants, *i.e.*,
    slaves. Paul ever gloried in being the “servant (slave) of Jesus
    Christ” (Romans 1:1). The negro Christian expressed the truth when
    in prayer he asked the Lord to keep him, in the following words: “O
    Lord, if You do not look after Your property, it will go wrong.”
2.  **We should watch for Christ, because we do not know when He may
    come** (Matt. 24:44). The coming of Christ is a subject that has
    been brought into ill-repute because of unholy speculation. *When*
    Christ may come we dare not say, but that He *is* coming, He Himself
    has said. Dare we question His word on the one hand, or speculate
    about it on the other?
3.  **We should watch for Christ, for it will make us morally and holily
    ready for Him.** The hope of Christ’s return is purifying in its
    effect, as we read in 1 John 3:2-3. “Ready for either,” is the
    inscription upon the seal of one of our Missionary Societies, which
    seal has also upon it an ox, standing between a plough and an altar;
    this at once suggests that the ox is ready for service or sacrifice.
    Thus all who are Christ’s should be ready to do His will, whether
    that will means suffering or serving.\
     Of those who go into the marriage supper of the Lamb, readiness is
    the result of their righteous acts (Revelation 19:8, R. V.).
4.  **Watching for Christ is an indication of our faithfulness to Him**
    (Matt. 24:45). Faithfulness is only another word for obedience. King
    Saul lost his kingdom, through his unfaithfulness in not obeying the
    voice of the Lord (1 Samuel 15:23); while Paul the Apostle has a
    “crown of righteousness,” because he kept the faith and ran in the
    race faithfully (2 Timothy 4:7-8). The wise and faithful servant is
    one who gives to the household their meat in due season (verse 45).
    Those who act according to God’s heart (Jeremiah 3:15), ever seek to
    give, by life and lips, the Bread of Life to hungry souls.
5.  **Watching for Christ will bring blessing now and reward hereafter**
    (Matt. 24:46-47). Blessing is the gift of grace (Eph. 1:3), but
    reward is the outcome of service (2 Cor. 5:10).
6.  **Watching for Christ will preserve us from evil, and beget
    faithfulness to Him in every particular** (Matt. 24:48-51).

# 475. Weak Ones

1.  The weak ones whom Jehovah uses are **tested** ones (Judges 7:2-7).
2.  The weak ones whom the Lord uses are **not anxious** about their own
    comfort (Judges 7:6).
3.  The weak ones whom God uses are **obedient** (Judges 7:17-20).
4.  The weak ones whom God uses are **dependent** ones (Judges 7:18,
    20).
5.  The weak ones whom God uses are **united** (Judges 7:22).
6.  The weak ones whom the Lord uses are **victorious** ones (Judges
    7:21).
7.  The weak ones are used as **reflectors** of God’s glory (Judges
    7:2).
8.  The used of God are **sure** to have their action called in question
    by their brethren (Judges 8:1).
9.  The instruments of God are **persevering**, although faint (Judges
    8:4).
10. The instruments of the Lord are **faithful** (Judges 7:8).
11. The instruments of the Lord may **fall into sin** unless careful
    (Judges 8:24, 27)Â·
12. The weak ones are a **source of blessing** to others (Judges 8:28).

# 476. We Have

THERE are many things that the Holy Spirit says we have in Christ—

1.  **Peace.** “We *have* peace with God” (Romans 5:1).
2.  **Redemption.** “In Whom we *have* redemption through His blood”
    (Ephesians 1:7).
3.  **Eternal Life.** “These things have I written unto you that believe
    on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye *have*
    eternal life” (1 John 5:13).
4.  **The Spirit of Adoption.** “Ye *have* received the Spirit of
    adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father” (Rom. 8:15).
5.  **Strong Consolation.** “We might *have* a strong consolation”
    (Hebrews 6:18).
6.  **A Sure Anchor.** “Which hope we *have* as an anchor of the soul,
    both sure and stedfast” (Hebrews 6:19).
7.  **A Great High Priest.** “We *have* such an High Priest” (Hebrews
    8:1).
8.  **A Glorified Body in Reserve.** “We *have* a building of God, a
    house not made with hands” (2 Cor. 5:1).
9.  **Provision.** “We *have* an Altar” (Heb. 13:10).

# 477. Well Pleasing

1.  **Whole-hearted Presentation of Ourselves.** “Present your bodies a
    living sacrifice, holy, *well-pleasing* (margin) to God” (Romans
    12:1, R.V.).
2.  **The Purpose in all our Life.** “Make it our aim…to be
    *well-pleasing* unto Him” (2 Cor. 5:9, R.V.).
3.  **Walking as Children of the Light.** “Proving what is
    *well-pleasing* unto the Lord” (Eph. 5:10, R.V.).
4.  **Ministering to the Need of Others.** “A sacrifice acceptable,
    *well-pleasing* to God” (Phil. 4:18).
5.  **Obedience to those who are over us.** “Children obey your
    parents…for this is *well-pleasing* in the Lord” (Colossians 3:20,
    R.V.).
6.  **An Illustration of Well-pleasingness.** “Enoch…had been
    *well-pleasing* unto God” (Heb. 11:5, R.V.).
7.  **Holding fast Grace for Service.** “We may offer service
    *well-pleasing* to God” (Heb. 12:28, R.V.).
8.  **Doing good to others.** “To do good…God is *well-pleased*” (Heb.
    13:16, R.V.).
9.  **Allowing God to Work in us.** “Working in us that which is
    *well-pleasing*” (Heb. 13:21, R.V.).

# 478. Went Down

THE down-grade towards, and in, evil and error is no modern practice.

1.  **A Saint out of Communion.** “Abram *went down* into Egypt”
    (Genesis 12:10).
2.  **A Backsliding Worker.** “Jonah *went down* to Joppa” (Jonah 1:3);
    “*went down* into it” (Jonah 1:3); “*went down* to the bottoms”
    (Jonah 2:6).
3.  **A Self-willed Actor.** “Samson *went down* to Timnath…She is right
    in mine eyes” (Judges 14:1-3, M.).
4.  **A Disobedient Alliance.** Jehoshaphat “*went down* to Ahab” (2
    Chron. 18:1-2; 2 Cor. 6:14).
5.  **A Robbed Man.** “*Went down* from Jerusalem” (the place of
    blessing) “to Jericho” (the cursed place), “and fell among thieves”
    (Luke 10:30). An illustration of what sin has done for man.
6.  **Cleansed Leper.** Naaman “*went down* and dipped himself seven
    times in Jordan…and he was clean” (2 Kings 5:14). Jordan means
    judgment; Christ went down into the Jordan of God’s judgment, that
    we might be cleansed from sin (Matt. 3; Rom. 8).
7.  **Punished Rebels.** “Korah…*went down* alive into the pit” (Sheol,
    Numbers 16:32-33).

    God” (Acts 8:37).

# 481. What an Imperfect Heart Means

SOLOMON’S SIN. I. KINGS 11:4-13

SOLOMON began well, but he ended ill. The fair morning of his life is
followed by the foul weather of inconsistency in the evening of his
career. The rosy apple has a maggot which spoils it. As the Thames for
many miles from its source is sweet and healthful, but when it passes
through London it is polluted by the pollution that pours into it; so
the first part of Solomon’s life is beautiful with godliness, but the
latter part of it is blighted with idolatry and sensuality. And all this
arose from one cause, namely, an imperfect heart.

1.  **An imperfect heart is a divided heart** (1 Kings 11:4-5). Solomon
    could give good instruction (1 Kings 8:61), but he did not continue
    in following up his own precept. He thought he could share his
    affection with the gods of the heathen. There are many today who
    think that they can go with the world, and with Christ too. No one
    can serve two masters (Matt. 6:24); we must be for Christ, or
    against Him (Matt. 12:30). A friend of the world is an enemy to God
    (James 4:4).
2.  **An imperfect heart is a defaulting heart.** Solomon was was not
    like his father David (1 Kings 11:4), who, in spite of his failures,
    was true in his loyalty to the Lord, and did not get into the meshes
    of idolatry. The remembrance of what David was, should have kept
    Solomon true to Jehovah. When the eyes of the soul get off the Lord,
    and look to that which is pleasing to the flesh, then it will not be
    long before we mix with the ungodly as Lot did (Genesis 19:1), boast
    in self-confidence as Peter did (Luke 22:33), lie as Abraham did
    (Genesis 20:2), get in danger as Jehoshaphat did (2 Chronicles
    18:31), look to men as the Corinthians did (1 Corinthians 1:12),
    feel the chastening hand of God as Israel did (1 Cor. 10:5), and
    listen to the voice of the ungodly as Solomon did, when he hearkened
    to the voice of his wives.
3.  **An imperfect heart is a distant heart** (1 Kings 11:6). “Went not
    fully.” Ah! here is the cause of his declension. If we note what it
    is to follow the Lord fully, we shall be better able to determine
    what it is, not to thus follow Him. To follow the Lord fully,
    signifies that we consecrate\* ourselves to Him as Israel did (2
    Chron. 29:31); we act in faith as Joshua did, when he wholly\*
    followed the Lord (Joshua 14:8); we fulfil\* the Word of the Lord,
    as Judah did unconsciously when carried away into captivity (2
    Chron. 36:21); we devote our whole strength to the Lord, as when
    Jehu drew the bow with his full\* strength (2 Kings 9:24); we serve
    the Lord, as He has enjoined, as Jacob fulfilled\* the specified
    time for Rachel (Genesis 29:28); we occupy the place the Lord
    intends, as the precious stones were set\* in the breastplate of the
    High Priest according to His instructions (Exodus 39:10); and we are
    guided and empowered by the Holy Spirit, as the workmen of the
    tabernacle were filled\* with the Spirit for their employment
    (Exodus 28:3). It goes without the saying that the antithesis to all
    this is, not to follow the Lord fully.
4.  **An imperfect heart is a defiled heart** (1 Kings 11:7). Solomon’s
    association with idolatry would bring him into contact with the
    ungodly, hence, he was bound to be defiled. The breath of the world
    will tarnish the brightness of our faith; the contaminating touch of
    iniquity will blacken our life; the influence of covetousness will
    damp down the fire of our love; the infection of doubt will poison
    our confidence; the malaria of envy will fever our soul; the frost
    of self will chill our affection; and the leprosy of sin will infect
    our nature, and extinguish our testimony.
5.  **An imperfect heart is a displeasing heart** (1 Kings 11:9). The
    ire of Jehovah was kindled against Solomon, because of his
    backsliding. He had received many privileges, for the Lord had twice
    appeared to him (1 Kings 3:5; 9:2). But he forgets his blessing. To
    displease the Lord means, that we place ourselves under His
    chastening hand, which will bring us sorrow of heart, and soreness
    of spirit.
6.  **An imperfect heart is a disobedient heart** (1 Kings 11:10).
    Solomon was disobedient in a twofold sense. First, in marrying the
    “strange women” (1 Kings 11:1-2), for the Lord had given plain and
    specific instructions that none of His people were to do this
    (Exodus 34:16; Deuteronomy 7:3-4); and second, Solomon was
    disobedient in going after “other gods” (Exodus 20:4). These
    commands have an application to us now (2 Corinthians 6:14; Matthew
    4:10), and well for us if we follow the Divine instruction, for
    obedience is always the pathway of blessing.
7.  **An imperfect heart is a disintegrating heart** (1 Kings 11:11).
    Solomon’s sin led to the dismemberment of his empire. He did not
    live to see it, but it came in God’s appointed time. If God’s mills
    grind slowly, they none the less grind surely. When we sin, we not
    only bring damage to ourselves, but we also bring distress to
    others.

* * * * *

\* The words “*consecrate*” in 2 Chronicles 29:31, “*wholly*” in Joshua
14:8, “*fulfil*” in 2 Chronicles 36:21, “*full*” in 2 Kings 9:24,
“*fulfilled*” in Genesis 29:28, “*set*” in Exodus 39:10, and “*filled*”
in Exodus 28:3, are the same in the Hebrew.
# 482. “What Does It Mean to Follow Jesus?”

IT is well that we should ponder the privileges of the Christian life,
but we must not forget that those privileges mean corresponding
responsibilities; and it is also well to remember that we cannot fulfil
the responsibilities, only as we enjoy by faith the privileges. To come
to Christ, and to receive from Christ, are our privileges; and to abide
in Christ, and to follow after Him, are our responsibilities.

To follow Christ, means at least three things; and these are—\
 sacrifice, suffering, and glory.

1.  **Sacrifice.** In the case of the disciples it meant leaving their
    nets (Matthew 4:19-20): with Matthew, forsaking the “receipt of
    custom” (Matthew 9:9); and with the rich young ruler it was “sell
    all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor” (Luke 18:22). To
    follow Christ, means at least two things, namely, the denial of self
    itself (Matthew 16:24); and the putting Christ and His claims first
    (Luke 9:57-62).
2.  **Suffering.** Christ’s distinct and definite command to Peter, as
    He tells him that he will have to die for Him, is, “Follow Me” (John
    21:19). Peter understood that to mean death (2 Peter 1:14). There is
    a “cross” for every follower of Christ (Mark 10:21), and a death to
    the self-life, in order that we may bring forth fruit unto God (John
    12:24-26). Jordan with its baptism, Gethsemane with its bitter cup,
    Gabbatha with its fiendish mockery, Golgotha with its shame, the
    Cross with its suffering, the darkness with its cry, and Calvary
    with its death, have their counterpart in our experience.
3.  **Glory.** It is to His followers that Christ promises that they
    shall “sit in the throne of His glory” (Matthew 19:28); who shall be
    with Him, and also be honoured by the Father (John 12:26). Christ
    not only leads His followers to the Mount of Calvary to suffer with
    Him, but He also leads them to the Mount of Transfiguration, that
    they may be glorified with Him.

To follow Christ in holiness of life, in compassion of heart, in
devotion of service, in abandonment of will, in patience of spirit, in
earnestness of soul, and in loyalty to truth, is to evidence that we are
His sheep (John 10:27). Surely, this is the least we can do, even as
Bartimaeus (Mark 10:52), and the noble band of women (Matthew 27:55). Of
the former we read, “He followed Jesus in the way,” and of the latter we
read, “which followed Jesus into Galilee, ministering unto Him.”
# 483. What Every Man Needs

ALL men need the following seven things, among many others, whether they
know it or not:—

1.  **Saviour, to deliver** from the power of darkness (Col. 1:13), as
    Israel needed to be delivered from Pharaoh’s power (Exodus 3:8).
2.  **Strength, to empower** the soul to walk in God’s ways (Isaiah
    40:31), as the lame man required power to enable him to walk (Acts
    3:6).
3.  **Satisfier to fill,** that the longing of the heart may be met
    (Psalm 107:9), as the need of the multitude was satisfied with
    Christ’s provision (John 6:11-12).
4.  **Sanctifier to separate,** that the believer may be separated from
    the evil, and kept to the good (2 Cor. 7:1), as the Levites were
    sanctified by Aaron (Numbers 18:2, &c.).
5.  **Succourer, to aid** in the hour of weakness and temptation
    (Hebrews 2:18), as David was the succourer of Israel when he acted
    on their behalf (1 Samuel 17:50).
6.  **Shield, to defend** in the time of aggressive warfare (Eph. 6:16),
    as Paul indicates when he writes to Timothy (2 Timothy 2:1-4).
7.  **Sovereign to rule,** that the domain of man-soul may be kept under
    the rule of Emmanuel (1 Peter 3:15, R.V.); this is illustrated in
    the centurion, who said that he was a man under authority (Luke
    7:8).

# 484. What is a Christian?

1.  **Believer in faith.** “Believeth on the Son” (John 3:36).
2.  **Servant in responsibility.** “Blessed is that servant” (Luke
    12:43).
3.  **Branch in union.** “I am the Vine, ye are the branches” (John
    15:5).
4.  **Friend in privilege.** “I have called you friends…I have made
    known unto you” (John 15:15).
5.  **Witness in testimony.** “Thou shalt be His witness unto all men”
    (Acts 22:15).
6.  **Steward in trust.** “As good stewards of the manifold grace of
    God” (1 Peter 4:10).
7.  **Light in influence.** “Ye are the light of the world…Let your
    light so shine” (Matthew 5:14, 16).
8.  **Salt in power.** “Ye are the salt of the earth” (Matt. 5:13).

# 485. What is a Christian?

WHAT is a Christian? Many are the answers that have been given to the
above question. The servant girl’s definition of Christians was very far
out, who, when asked what Christians were, replied, “People that go to
church and chapel, that talk about religion, and take the parson home to
tea.” That was her idea of a Christian, which, doubtless, she had
gathered from the *professing* Christians with whom she had come in
contact, but we need hardly say that this is not the Scriptural
definition of a Christian.

“Christian names are everywhere;\
 Christian men are very rare.”

The little girl was nearer the mark when she said, “A Christian is a
born-again person;” for to be born again, is to be—

**Saved by the grace of God.** “By grace *are* ye saved through faith”
(Ephesians 2:8).

**Sanctified in the Person of Christ.** “Church of God…to them that
*are* sanctified in Christ Jesus” (1 Corinthians 1:2).

**Sealed with the Holy Spirit.** “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
whereby ye *are* sealed unto the day of redemption” (Ephesians 4:30).

**Shining for the Lord Jesus.** “Ye *are* the light of the world”
(Matthew 5:14).

**Serving with the Lord.** “We *are* labourers together with God” (1
Corinthians 3:9).

**Slaves of the Lord.** “Ye *are* not your own, for ye *are* bought with
a price” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

**Surrendering to the Lord.** “To whom ye yield yourselves servants to
obey, his servants ye *are*” (Romans 6:16). Note that in the Scriptures
the word “*are*” occurs against each point, and, if they are carefully
looked at, we shall find that a past definite act, a present fact, and a
continuous consequence are referred to. What is a Christian? One has
said, in defining a Christian, that he is—

“In faith, a believer in Christ.

  In relationship, a child of God.

  In character, a saint.

  In influence, a light.

  In communion, a friend.

  In conflict, a soldier.

  In experience, a pilgrim.

  In expectation, an heir.”
# 486. What is a Christian?

WHAT is a Christian? Bunyan, in his *Pilgrim’s Progress*, simply
defines, and in descriptive imagery depicts the path and progress of a
Christian.

1.  **An awakened Sinner.** A Christian is one who has been *convinced*
    of his sinfulness and guilt as a sinner before God, as seen in the
    burden on Christian’s back (Psalm 38:4).
2.  **A trustful Man.** A Christian is one who has *come* to the
    Saviour, as pictured in Christian coming up to the wicket gate, and
    entering into the path that leads therefrom (Matt. 11:28).
3.  **A righteous one.** A Christian is one who is *clothed* with the
    garment of righteousness, as we see in Christian being clothed at
    the cross (2 Cor. 5:21).
4.  **An earnest Worker.** A Christian is one who is *concerned* about
    the welfare of others, as illustrated in Christian going up to, and
    seeking to arouse Simple, Sloth, and Presumption (Jude 23).
5.  **A communing Companion.** A Christian is one who *companions* with
    the people of God. Talkative and Ignorance can have no fellowship
    with Christian, but Faithful and Hopeful are his fast friends (1
    John 3:14).
6.  **A dominated Believer.** A Christian is one who is *controlled* by
    the Word of God, as seen in Christian consulting his roll. A true
    Christian receives the *whole* of the Bible as God’s Word, and dares
    not utter such blasphemy as a Free Church Professor has recently
    done. He says: “A man may be a true (?) Christian (?) and yet find
    much in the Bible which he cannot accept.” Rev. 22:19 is the direct
    contradiction to this, for what is said there may be applied to all
    Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16-17).
7.  **A persevering Saint.** A Christian is one who *continues* in the
    way of holiness, as illustrated in the perseverance of Christian.
    Lions may frighten him; Doubt may lead him into captivity; and
    Flattery ensnare him, but he keeps on (John 8:31).
8.  **A confessing Pilgrim.** A Christian is one who *confesses* that he
    is a pilgrim and stranger, as depicted in Christian and Faithful
    passing through Vanity Fair (Heb. 11:13).
9.  **A courageous Traveller.** A Christian is one who *courageously*
    pushes on his way amidst surrounding difficulties, as illustrated in
    Christian passing through the Valley of the Shadow of Death (Psalm
    23:4).
10. **A conquering Soldier.** A Christian is one who *conquers* his
    enemies, as seen in the fight of Christian with Apollyon (1 John
    5:18).
11. **An expectant Contemplator.** A Christian is one who *contemplates*
    with delight the prospect of heaven’s glory, as represented in the
    pilgrims on the Delectable Mountains (Jude 21, 24).

We have thus in the book that has been said “to be next to the Bible,”
and next to it because so full of it, a most exhaustive and extensive
description of what a Christian is.
# 487. What is a Christian?

WE find that the word “Christian” only occurs three times in the New
Testament. First, “If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be
ashamed” (1 Peter 4:16). Second, “Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian,” which was spoken in contempt by Agrippa to Paul (Acts 26:28,
R.V.). Third, “The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch”
(Acts 11:26). It has been a matter of contention as to who called them
Christians, whether it was a name applied to them in ridicule by the
world, or whether God called them by that name. We believe God called
them Christians, from the simple fact that the word “called” in the
eight instances where it is recorded, has reference to God Himself
speaking and acting. The wise men, “*being warned* of God,” did not
return to Herod (Matthew 2:12); Joseph, “*being warned* of God,” turned
aside to Galilee (Matthew 2:22); it was *revealed* unto Simeon by the
Holy Ghost that he “should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s
Christ” (Luke 2:26); Cornelius “*was warned* from God” (Acts 10:22);
“She *shall be called* an adulteress” (Romans 7:3), that is because God
calls her so; “Moses *was admonished* of God” (Hebrews 8:5); “Noah
*being warned* of God” (Hebrews 11:7); “If they escaped not who refused
him *that spake* on earth” (Hebrews 12:25). Thus in every case where the
Holy Spirit uses this word,\* it has reference to a communication from
God, and hence we assume that the title “Christian” is God-given.

We give an acrostic on the word “Christian,” as illustrating what he is-

**Child of God,** as to his relationship to the Lord (John 1:12-13).

**Heir of God,** as to his inheritance in the Lord (1 Peter 1:3-4).

**Redeemed one,** as to his being freed by the Lord (Rom. 8:2; Ephesians
1:7).

**Influence,** as to his responsibility to the Lord (Matthew 5:14-16).

**Soldier,** as to fighting for the Lord (2 Timothy 2:3).

**Temple,** as to being occupied by the Lord (1 Corinthians 3:16).

**Instrument,** to be used by the Lord (Romans 6:13).

**Ambassador,** as to his representation of the Lord (2 Cor. 5:20).

**New man** in Christ, as to his attitude towards the Lord and the world
(2 Corinthians 5:17).

# 489. What Love Does, as Illustrated in David and Jonathan

I. SAMUEL 20:32-42

DAVID’S confession about Jonathan’s love for him, was that it “was
wonderful” (1 Samuel 1:26). In Jonathan’s regard for David we have
illustrated the attitude and action of love.

1.  **Question of Love.** Jonathan knew that all the hate that was
    burning in the mind of his father Saul against David, was born of
    jealousy, so he dares to ask the question, “What hath he done” (1
    Samuel 20:32). Love will often make us bold, when under ordinary
    circumstances we should be timid. It was love to Christ that made
    Mary “early” at the sepulchre (John 20:1), and that prompted John to
    run with fleetness of foot, and get to the tomb “first” (John 20:4).
2.  **Discernment of Love** (1 Samuel 20:33). Saul’s casting the javelin
    at Jonathan, led Jonathan to see what he would do to David the first
    opportunity that occurred, yea, what he had intended to do. Love can
    see farther than reason. Love has long sight and insight. Love is
    not deceived by appearances, nor gulled by probabilities. Love is a
    thermometer that ascertains the temperature of things.
3.  **Grief of Love** (1 Samuel 20:34). Jonathan is greatly grieved at
    the attitude of Saul towards David. The hatred of Saul to David cuts
    like a knife into the heart of Jonathan, and causes it to bleed with
    anguish for his friend. Love is always concerned for the object it
    loves. It was the love which Paul had to Christ and to Christ’s,
    that prompted him to labour (1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:8), yea, that
    made him willing to be accursed, if others might be saved (Romans
    9:3).
4.  **Punctuality of Love.** At the appointed time Jonathan goes to
    apprise David of the state of matters (1 Samuel 20:35). Love is
    never late with its engagements. In the “fulness of the time” Christ
    was born (Galatians 4:4). When “the hour was come” to keep the
    Passover, “He sat down” (Luke 22:14); and when the hour of His death
    arrived, He gave Himself up to be led to the death of the cross
    (John 17:1). Believers should be equally observant in doing what the
    Lord enjoins on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2),
    and in the assembling together for prayer (Heb. 10:25). This we
    shall do, and do constantly (Acts 2:42), and well, if we truly love
    Christ.
5.  **Arrangement of Love** (1 Samuel 20:36-40). Jonathan had previously
    arranged with David about the signals which should indicate Saul’s
    feeling towards him, and these would show him whether he should
    return home or go away (1 Samuel 20:19-23). The lad who was with
    Jonathan and playing a part, little thought that he was a sign in
    his actions to the hidden David. What appears to be an ordinary
    event to a man of the world, is often an extraordinary event to the
    man who loves God (Romans 8:28). The cross of Christ to the mob
    seemed to hold an impostor, but the event of all events was being
    carried out there (Acts 2:23), and the arrangement that had long
    since been come to, was being fulfilled (1 Peter 1:20).
6.  **Fellowship of Love** (1 Samuel 20:41). How significant are the
    words, “Wept one with another,” Kindred hearts are beating in mutual
    sympathy. What a type we have here! Our divine Jonathan sympathizes
    with us in all our trials and afflictions, for He is “touched with
    the feeling of our infirmities” (Heb. 4:15), and what He feels for
    us, we should feel for Him, in loving our brethren (1 John 3:14-18)
    as He has bid us (John 13:34).
7.  **Benediction of Love** (1 Samuel 20:42). “Go in peace,” is
    Jonathan’s benediction upon David. How these words remind us of the
    words of our Divine Jonathan, when He said, “Peace I leave with you,
    My peace I give unto you” (John 14:27). When we have His blessing of
    peace, it calms the storm of temptation and the wind of trouble, and
    causes a great calm in the heart, and sweet stillness in the soul
    (Luke 8:24).

# 490. What Shall I Do?

Several times we find the above question asked in the New Testament. The
following give a consecutive chain of thought:—

1.  **A Dismissed Steward.** “*What shall I do?* for my lord taketh away
    from me the stewardship” (Luke 16:3). The unjust steward is
    commended for his thoughtfulness, and not for his sinfulness, by
    Christ (see Luke 16:9, R.V.).
2.  **A Directed Son.** “*What shall I do?* I will send My Beloved Son”
    (Luke 20:13). It seems as if God were uncertain what to do in the
    face of man’s sin. We know now what He did (John 3:16-18).
3.  **A Determined Suppliant.** “There came one running, and kneeled to
    Him, and asked Him, Good Master, *what shall I do* that I may
    inherit eternal life?” (Mark 10:17). He was determined in his
    pleading, but not in practising Christ’s direction.
4.  **A Distressed Soul.** “*What must I do* to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).
    Done is the work that saves. To believe in Him who has done the
    work, saves (John 6:29).
5.  **A Puzzled Judge.** “*What shall I do* then with Jesus?” (Matthew
    27:22). Pilate was in a quandary, and could not get out of it. He
    had not the moral courage to be true to his convictions.
6.  **A Submissive Sinner.** “*What shall I do*, Lord?” (Acts 22:10).
    Saul was turned to Christ by His manifestation. He is now as much
    for Him as He was against Him before.
7.  **A Foolish Man.** “*What shall I do?*” “This will I do.” (Luke
    12:17-18). A fool always answers his own question by a self-willed
    action. He never waits for God’s direction.

# 491. What We Are to Do with the Word of God

1.  **Receive the Word with meekness,** and thus be saved from all
    wickedness (James 1:21).
2.  **Let it dwell in us richly,** that we may teach others (Col. 3:16).
3.  **Keep it,** and thus have His love perfected in us (1 John 2:5).
4.  **Continue in it,** that it may be manifest that we are His
    disciples indeed (John 8:31).
5.  **Hold it fast,** that we may be able to convince gainsayers (Titus
    1:9).
6.  **Be doers of it,** and not deceive ourselves by thinking that
    hearing is enough without the doing (James 1:22).
7.  **Speak it out boldly,** that the Lord may be honoured (Phil. 1:14).
8.  **Hold it forth faithfully,** by living it out truly (Phil. 2:16).

# 492. Where Blessing Is Found

BLESSING from the Lord runs in the channel of obedience to Him, as we
are found in the path of duty.

1.  **Revelation.** The angels appeared to the shepherds, and announced
    the Saviour’s birth, as they were watching their flocks (Luke
    2:8-10).
2.  **Manifestation.** The angel of Jehovah manifested Himself to Moses
    as he kept the flock over which he was shepherd (Ex. 3:1-3).
3.  **Commission.** The Lord took David from the sheep-fold to be king
    over Israel, for as he had been faithful in the former position, so
    he would be in the latter (Ps. 78:70).
4.  **Qualification.** It was while Gideon was threshing the corn that
    the Lord made known to him that He intended him to be the deliverer
    of Israel (Judges 6:11).
5.  **Substitution.** Elisha was called from the plough to be the
    companion and successor to Elijah (1 Kings 19:19).
6.  **Identification.** It was while Matthew was at the receipt of
    custom (Matt. 9:9), and the disciples were following their
    occupation as fishermen, that the Lord called them to be His
    disciples and witnesses (Matt. 4:18).
7.  **Satisfaction.** The woman of Samaria little thought when she came
    to draw water from Jacob’s well that she would there receive a drink
    which would satisfy her heart (John 4:14).

# 493. “White as Snow”

THE words “*white as snow*” occur in three connections in the Word of
God, namely, in association with sin, the Saviour, and salvation.

1.  **Sin.** Leprosy is a pronounced type of sin. There are three
    persons who were stricken with leprosy, “*white as snow*,” and these
    were—Moses, for his hesitation (Ex. 4:6); Miriam, for her opposition
    (Numbers 12:10); and Gehazi, for his covetousness (2 Kings 5:27).
2.  **Saviour.** When Christ was transfigured, His raiment was
    “exceeding *white as snow*” (Mark 9:3); and when John saw Him, “His
    head and His hairs were white like wool, as *white as snow*” (Rev.
    1:14). White is here emblematic of Christ’s personal holiness and
    His righteous action.
3.  **Salvation.** “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
    *white as snow*” (Isaiah 1:18). The one effectual cause that brings
    about this transformation is the blood of Christ (Rev. 7:14).

# 494. “Whose I Am”

(ACTS 27:23)

THE Christian belongs to Christ.

1.  **We are His by donation.** We have been given to Christ by the
    Father (John 17:6).
2.  **We are His by His death;** for He has bought us with His blood (1
    Cor. 6:20).
3.  **We are His by deliverance,** for He has delivered us from the
    kingdom of darkness (Col. 1:13).
4.  **We are His by dependence,** for by His grace we are what we are (1
    Cor. 15:10).
5.  **We are His by His dwelling within us,** for our bodies are the
    temples of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 3:16).
6.  **We are His by direction,** for “as many as are led by the Spirit
    of God, they are the sons of God” (Rom. 8:14).
7.  **We are His by dedication,** for we have yielded ourselves to Him
    (Rom. 6:16).

# 495. “With Him”

1.  **Dead with Him.** “If ye be dead with Christ” (Col. 2:20).
2.  **Buried with Him.** “Buried with Him in baptism” (Col. 2:12).
3.  **Quickened together with Him.** “You…hath He quickened together
    with Him” (Col. 2:13).
4.  **Risen with Him.** “Ye are risen with Him” (Col. 2:12).
5.  **Seated with Him.** “Will I grant to sit with Me” (Rev. 3:21).
6.  **Suffering with Him.** “If so be that we suffer with Him” (Rom.
    8:17).
7.  **Reigning with Him.** “Shall reign with Him a thousand years” (Rev.
    20:6; Rev. 22:5).

# 496. Wisdom

THE following points illustrate how we may fulfil the injunction, “Be
wise”:…

1.  **Building.** Building on the rock in obedience to the truth (Matt.
    7:24).
2.  **Receiving.** Receiving the truth of the Scriptures, and thus being
    wise unto salvation (2 Tim. 3:15).
3.  **Possessing.** Having the oil of the grace of the Holy Spirit
    (Matt. 25:2-5).
4.  **Living.** Living a good life in meekness (James 3:13, R.V.).
5.  **Walking.** Walking carefully in the world (Eph. 5:15, R.V.).
6.  **Dwelling.** Being in the environment of Christ’s presence, and not
    being influenced by men (1 Cor. 4:10).
7.  **Seeking.** Ever seeking the good, and thus avoiding the evil (Rom.
    16:19).

# 497. What the Tongue Can Do

JAMES 3:1-13

THE heathen philosopher, Xanthus, expecting some friends to dine with
him, ordered his servant Esop to provide the best things the market
could supply. Tongues only were provided, served up with different
sauces. Course after course was supplied, each consisting of tongue.
“Did I not order you to buy the best the market afforded?” cried
Xanthus. “And did I not obey you,” replied Esop. “Is there anything
better than the organ of truth, and the instrument of praise and
worship?” On the next day Xanthus ordered him to provide the worst thing
in the market. And lo, there was another dinner of tongue! “For,” said
Esop, “surely the tongue is the worst thing in the world, the instrument
of strife, and the organ of lies, and blasphemy.”

The Holy Spirit plainly indicates who is the perfect man; it is the man
who has the mastery of his own tongue (James 3:2). We have known some
who have boasted of sinless perfection, who, if they were judged by this
standard, would be perfect in sin, instead of being sinlessly perfect.

1.  **A Suggestive Simile.** An evil tongue is compared to a fire, which
    is a world of iniquity (James 3:6). A spark of fire is capable of
    immense mischief. The city of Portland, in America, was reduced to
    ashes from a fire, kindled by a fire-cracker, on the 4th of July.
    Chicago was also burnt to the ground, through a kerosene lamp,
    kicked over by a cow; and the great fire of London in 1666,
    commemorated by the monument, broke out in one house in Pudding
    Lane. Many a prairie fire has owed its origin to a single spark from
    a passing engine.\
     Think of the many piles of iniquity that have been lighted by the
    fire of the tongue! It was the devil’s *insinuating* tongue that
    caused our first parents to sin (Genesis 3:4); it was the *lying*
    tongues of Joseph’s brethren, which gave Jacob so much grief
    (Genesis 37:32); it was the *deceitful* tongue of Jacob that robbed
    Esau of his blessing (Genesis 27:18-20); it was the *obstinate*
    tongue of Pharaoh that caused the plagues to be sent (Exodus 10:28);
    it was the *jealous* tongue of Miriam that caused her to be smitten
    with leprosy (Numbers 12:1, 10); it was the *proud* tongue of Korah
    and his followers that brought such swift judgment upon them
    (Numbers 16:3, 32); it was the *fault-finding* tongues of Job’s
    friends that ministered such trouble to him (Job 4); it was the
    *covetous* tongue of Judas, which caused Christ to be betrayed to
    His death (Matthew 26:15); it was the *boasting* tongue of Peter
    which made him deny his Lord (Matthew 26:70); it was the *unholy*
    tongue of Ananias that made him lie to the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3);
    it was the *sectarian* tongue of the Corinthians that caused the
    divisions among them (1 Corinthians 1:12); and it was the *prating*
    tongue of Diotrephes, which caused so much trouble in the Church (3
    John 9-10).\
     The following maxims relating to the tongue are to the point:—
    -   “ ‘The boneless tongue, so small and weak,
    -   Can crush and kill,’ declared the Greek.”\
    -   “ ‘The tongue destroys a greater horde,’
    -   The Turk asserts, ‘than does the sword.’”\
    -   “The Persian proverb wisely saith,
    -   ‘A lengthy tongue, an early death.’”\
    -   “‘The tongue can speak a word whose speed,’
    -   Say the Chinese, ‘outstrips the steed.’”\
    -   “While Arab sages this impart,
    -   ‘The tongue’s great storehouse is the heart.’”\
    -   “From Hebrew wit the maxim sprung,
    -   ‘Though feet should slip, ne’er let the tongue.’”\
    -   “The sacred writer crowns the whole,
    -   ‘Who keeps the tongue doth keep his soul.’”

2.  **A Sanctified Servant.** While the tongue may be an evil, it also
    can be a great good. If the tongue is sanctified by grace, held in
    by the Lord, and influenced by the Spirit, then there shall come
    forth from it the sweetness of kind and helpful words, and the “good
    conversation” which is commendable to the Lord (James 3:10-13), for
    a sanctified tongue is—
    A tree of life to feed (Proverbs 15:4).
    A well-spring to refresh (Proverbs 18:4).
    An object of admiration (Proverbs 25:11).
    A goad to stimulate (Ecclesiastes 12:11).
    A salt to preserve (Colossians 4:6).
    A treasure to enrich (Luke 6:45).
    A jewel to beautify (Proverbs 20:15).
    As honey to please (Proverbs 16:24).
    As silver for choiceness (Proverbs 10:20).
    As food to strengthen (Proverbs 10:21).
    As fruit to satisfy (Proverbs 12:14).
    As health to gladden (Proverbs 12:18).

        unlikely.
    3.  **Untried.** Moses (Hebrews 11:28). Moses, about a thing

# 503. Weighty Words of Comfort

1.  **The “shall not” of sin.** “Ye *shall not* surely die” (Genesis
    3:4). Here we see the devil’s lie. The Lord had said in the previous
    chapter (Genesis 2:17), “Thou shalt surely die.” Man fell by
    believing the devil’s lie.
2.  **The “shall not” of safety.** “When I see the blood, I will pass
    over you, and the plague *shall not* be upon you” (Exodus 12:13).
    They were *safe* because the blood was sprinkled on the door-posts
    and lintel; and they were *sure* of it, because they had the word of
    God for it. Every believer in Christ is *safe* because resting in
    the *work* of Christ, and *sure* of it because resting in the *Word*
    of God.
3.  **The “shall not” of separation.** “*Shall not* eat of them” (Lev.
    11:4, 8, 11, 41, 42). The children of Israel could only eat of clean
    things; of beasts, only those that chewed the cud and divided the
    hoof. The divided hoof speaks to us of the separate walk; and
    chewing the cud, of meditation upon the Word. We are only to feed
    upon those things in a spiritual sense that will enable us to walk
    in separation from all that is evil.
4.  **The “shall not” of freshness.** “His leaf also *shall not* wither”
    (Ps. 1:3). The Lord’s trees are all evergreens, and always
    fruit-bearers. This is the result of separation from the world and
    its worldliness, and meditation *in*, and practice *of* the Word of
    God.
5.  **The “shall not” of remembrance.** “For the needy *shall not* alway
    be forgotten: the expectation of the poor *shall not* perish for
    ever” (Psalm 9:18). The wicked may flourish for a time, and many of
    God’s saints may be, and are poor as far as this world’s goods are
    concerned; but if it is only Christ and a crust here, there is the
    unchanging inheritance hereafter.
6.  **The “shall not” of stability.** “The Lord…is at my right hand: I
    *shall not* be moved” (Psalm 16:8; 62:2). The realised presence of
    the Lord beside us is the cure for unstableness. He is beside us as
    the *Strength* to uphold, as the *Companion* for fellowship, as the
    *Friend* to counsel, as the *Guide* to direct, as the *High Priest*
    to succour, as the *Comforter* to cheer, and as the *Teacher* to
    instruct.
7.  **The “shall not” of supply.** “The Lord is my Shepherd; I *shall
    not* want” (Psalm 23:1). If—and it all depends on the if—the Lord is
    our Shepherd, we shall not want for rest, good, satisfaction,
    guidance, restoration, renewing, righteousness, companionship,
    defence, care, comfort, provision, anointing, joy, goodness, mercy,
    and a home for ever, as the above Psalm testifies.
8.  **The “shall not” of Fatherly care.** “They that seek the Lord
    *shall not* want any good thing” (Psalm 34:10). Alexander Peden, in
    a sermon of his, says: “I remember as I came through the country,
    that there was a poor widow woman, whose husband fell at Bothwell.
    The bloody soldiers came to plunder her house, telling her that they
    would take all she had. ‘We will leave thee nothing,’ said they,
    ‘either to put in thee or on thee.’ ‘I care not,’ said she; ‘I will
    not want as long as God is in the heavens.’ That was a believer
    indeed.”
9.  **The “shall not” of courage.** “They *shall not* be ashamed in the
    evil time” (Psalm 37:19). We read in Isa. 50:7 of the Lord Jesus
    saying in prophecy, “Therefore have I set My face like a flint, and
    I know that I *shall not* be ashamed.” As Christ was not ashamed to
    go to the cross for us, although He despised the shame of it, so let
    us not be ashamed to take up the cross after Him, and boldly, yet
    humbly, confess Him.
10. **The “shall not” of preservation.** “Though he fall, he *shall not*
    be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand”
    (Psalm 37:24). “Do you believe in the *perseverance* of the saints?”
    was a question that was once asked. “No,” was the reply; “but I
    believe in the *preservation* of them.”
11. **The “shall not” of protection.** “God is in the midst of her: she
    *shall not* be moved” (Psalm 46:5). God in the midst, or the Holy
    Spirit in the believer, is the power for *walk*, *worship*,
    *warfare*, *witnessing*, and *work*. He is also within us as the
    *Spirit of Life*, *Light*, *Liberty*, *Leading*, and *Love*.
12. **The “shall not” of confidence.** “He only is my Rock and my
    Salvation; He is my Defence: I *shall not* be moved” (Psalm 62:6).
    Three precious things the Lord is to us here—(1) Our Rock for
    *stability*; (2) our Salvation for *safety*; (3) and our Defence for
    *security*. Verily, if He is this *only*, we shall not be moved.
13. **The “shall not” of trust.** “He *shall not* be afraid of evil
    tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord” (Psa. 112:7). The
    one whose heart is stayed upon God is above circumstances, and in
    all disappointments he takes away the “D” and puts the “H” in, and
    says they are His appointments.
14. **The “shall not” of holiness.** “And an highway shall be there, and
    a way, and it shall be called ‘The way of holiness;’ the unclean
    *shall not* pass over it” (Isaiah 35:8). What is holiness? 1.
    *Position*—“*highway*”—“sanctified in Christ.” 2. *Separation*—“way
    of holiness”—sanctified by blood. 3. *Purification*—“The unclean
    shall not pass over it”—“Cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
    the flesh and spirit” (2 Corinthians 7:1).
15. **The “shall not” of unerring.** “But it shall be for those (margin,
    ‘for He shall be with them’): the wayfaring men, though fools,
    *shall not* err therein” (Isaiah 35:8). How can they err when, as
    the margin puts it, He is with them? They have to submit to, and
    trust in their God, and His is the responsibility to bring them
    safely through.
16. **The “shall not’s” of Christ as the perfect Servant”** “He *shall
    not* cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the
    street. A bruised reed *shall* He *not* break, and the smoking flax
    *shall* He *not* quench; He shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
    He *shall not* fail nor be discouraged,” &c. (Isaiah 42:2-4). In the
    first, we have the humility of Christ; in the second, the patience
    of Christ; in the third, the tenderness of Christ; and in the
    fourth, the perseverance of Christ.
17. **The “shall not” of presence, promise, and protection.** “When thou
    passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
    rivers, they *shall not* overflow thee: when thou walkest through
    the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle
    upon thee” (Isaiah 43:2). He is *between us and the danger*, as He
    was with Daniel in the lion’s den; or He is *with us in the danger*,
    as He was with the three Hebrew young men in the fire.
18. **The “shall not” of faith.** “For the Lord God will help Me;
    therefore *shall I not* be confounded” (Isaiah 50:7). Here we hear
    the Lord Jesus as the Confident Man speaking. He is the Prince and
    Pattern of faith, and it is our privilege to trust in God as He did.
19. **The “shall not” of food.** “Man *shall not* live by bread alone,
    but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matt.
    4:4). These words the Lord Jesus spake to and overcame Satan by. The
    Word of God is the Christian’s food, and if we would be *strong* in
    soul, *useful* in service, *victorious* in conflict, and *glorify*
    God, we must continually feed thereon.
20. **The “shall not” of endurance.** “And I say unto thee, thou art
    Peter” (a stone), “and upon this rock” (the Rock—the Christship of
    Jesus) “I will build My Church; and the gates of hell (*hades*)
    *shall not* prevail against it” (Matt. 16:18). What a contrast we
    get in Rev. 1:18! Although the unseen world could not prevail
    against Christ, He has prevailed against it.
21. **The “shall not” of continuance.** “Heaven and earth shall pass
    away, but My words *shall not* pass away” (Matt. 24:35). What
    *consolation* this brings to the believer in Christ! but what
    *consternation* it ought to bring to the unsaved! See the following
    Scriptures, where we find the words, “It is written”:—*Sinner* (Rom.
    3:10-18); *Saviour* (Heb. 10:7); *servant* (Rom. 10:15); *child of
    God* (1 Peter 1:16); *neglecter* (Isaiah 65:6).
22. **The “shall not” of reward.** “For whosoever shall give you a cup
    of water to drink in My name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I
    say unto you, he *shall not* lose his reward” (Mark 9:41). The least
    thing done to any of Christ’s, He reckons as done to Himself.
23. **The “shall not” of communion.** “Martha, thou art careful and
    troubled about many things; but one thing is needful; and Mary hath
    chosen that good part, which *shall not* be taken away from her”
    (Luke 10:41-42). The Lord did not find fault with Martha for
    serving, but He did find fault with her for being *cumbered* with
    it, and *commended* Mary for putting Him first. The Lord wants of us
    the *worship* of Mary, and the *work* of Martha.
24. **The “shall not” of provision.** “But there *shall not*” (’not,
    not, a double negative’—*Newberry*) “an hair of your head perish”
    (Luke 21:18). We may well sing—
    -   “He who has fed, will feed;
    -    He who has led, will lead;
    -    He who has kept, will keep;
    -    He who has saved, will save.”

25. **The “shall not” of no condemnation.** “Verily, verily, I say unto
    you, he that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me,
    hath everlasting life, and *shall not* come into condemnation, but
    is passed from death unto life” (John 5:24). The very things that
    God would have had to judge the believer for at the great white
    throne, He has judged in Christ on the cross.
26. **The “shall not” of illumination.** “He that followeth Me *shall
    not* walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John
    8:12). Darkness symbolises sin, unbelief, and ignorance; and light,
    holiness, faith, and knowledge. If we are following Christ, we shall
    be like Him, trust Him, and know Him.
27. **The “shall not” of freedom.** “Sin *shall not* have dominion over
    you” (Romans 6:14). To say that we have no sin, is to contradict the
    Word of God. To say we must sin, is to destroy the whole work of
    Christ, and to utter a gross libel upon the indwelling Spirit. To
    say that we need not sin, is to state a blessed privilege.
28. **The “shall not” of confidence.** “Whosoever believeth on Him
    *shall not* be put to shame” (Romans 10:11, R.V.). If God be for us,
    there is no fear of being put to shame; for our interests are His.
29. **The “shall not” of glory.** “We *shall not* all sleep, but we
    shall all be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51). The Lord Himself coming
    *for* His people, was a truth the Old Testament knew not of, but it
    is the mystery now shown to us, if we have eyes to see it.
30. **The “shall not” of liberty.** “Walk in the Spirit, and ye *shall
    not* fulfil the lust of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16). There will be
    purity of heart and life, confidence towards God, and power with
    men, if we are walking in the Spirit.
31. **The “shall not” to the unsaved.** “The ungodly *shall not* stand
    in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”
    (Psalm 1:5). Who shall be able to stand in the Lord’s presence? Only
    those who are standing in His grace (Rom. 5:2). All others will be
    banished from Him. If hell is nothing else, it is this—eternal
    separation from God, and from all He is and has to give.
