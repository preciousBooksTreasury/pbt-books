<h1 class="caption">I. PRAYER ESSENTIAL TO GOD</h1>
<blockquote>"Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I
       am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
       speaking vanity."

       <br /> <br />
       14th verse: "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride
       upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for

<p>
IT must never be forgotten that Almighty God rules this world. He is not an absentee God. His hand is ever on
the throttle of human affairs. He is everywhere present in the concerns of time. "His eyes behold, his eyelids
try the children of men." He rules- the world just as He rules the Church by prayer. This lesson needs to be
emphasized, iterated and reiterated in the ears of men of modern times and brought to bear with cumulative
force on the consciences of this generation whose eyes have no vision for the eternal things, whose ears are
deaf toward God.
</p>
<p>
Nothing is more important to God than prayer in dealing with mankind. But it is likewise all-important to man
to pray. Failure to pray is failure along the whole line of life. It is failure of duty, service, and spiritual
progress. God must help man by prayer. He who does not pray, therefore, robs himself of God's help and
places God where He cannot help man. Man must pray to God if love for God is to exist. Faith and hope, aid
patience and all the strong, beautiful, vital forces of piety are withered and dead in a prayerless life. The life
of the individual believer, his personal salvation, and personal Christian graces have their being, bloom and
fruitage in prayer.
</p>
<p>
All this and much more can be said as to the necessity of prayer to the being, and culture of piety in the
individual. But prayer has a larger sphere, a more obligated duty, a loftier inspiration. Prayer concerns God,
whose purposes and plans are conditioned on prayer. His will and His glory are bound up in praying. The
days of God'splendour and renown have always been the great days of prayer. God's great movements in this
world have been conditioned on, continued and fashioned by prayer. God has put Himself in these great
movements just as men have prayed. Present, prevailing, conspicuous and mastering prayer has always
brought God to be present. The real and obvious test of a genuine work of God is the prevalence of the spirit
of prayer. God's mightiest forces surcharge and impregnate a movement when prayer's mightiest forces are
there. God's movement to bring Israel from Egyptian bondage had its inception in prayer. Thus early did God
and the human race put the fact of prayer as one of the granite forces upon which His world movements were
to be based. Hannah's petition for a son began a great prayer movement for God in Israel. Praying women,
whose prayers like those of Hannah, can give to the cause of God men like Samuel, do more for the Church
and the world than all the politicians on earth. Men born of prayer are the saviours of the state, and men
saturated with prayer give life and impetus to the Church. Under God they are saviours and helpers of both
Church and state.
</p>
<p>
We must believe that the divine record of the facts about prayer and God are given in order that we might be
constantly reminded of Him, and be ever refreshed by the faith that God holds His Church for the entire
world, and that God's purpose will be fulfilled. His plans concerning the Church will most assuredly and
inevitably be carried out. That record of God has been given without doubt that we may be deeply impressed
that the prayers of God's saints are a great factor, a supreme factor, in carrying forward God's work, with
facility and in time. When the Church is in the condition of prayer God's cause always flourishes and His
kingdom on earth always triumphs. When the Church fails to pray, God's cause decays and evil of every kind
prevails. In other words, God works through the prayers of His people, and when they fail Him at this point,
decline and deadness ensue. It is according to the divine plans that spiritual prosperity comes through the
prayer-channel. Praying saints are God's agents for carrying on His saving and providential work on earth. If
His agents fail Him, neglecting to pray, then His work fails. Praying agents of the Most High are always
forerunners of spiritual prosperity. The men of the Church of all ages who have held the Church for God have
had in affluent fullness and richness the ministry of prayer. The rulers of the Church which the Scriptures
reveal have had preeminence in prayer. Eminent, they may have been, in culture, in intellect and in all the
natural or human forces; or they may have been lowly in physical attainments and native gifts; yet in each
case prayer was the all potent force in the rulership of the Church. And this was so because God was with and
in what they did, for prayer always carries us back to God. It recognizes God and brings God into the world to
work and save and bless. The most efficient agents in disseminating the knowledge of God, in prosecuting
His work upon the earth, and in standing as breakwater against the billows of evil, have been praying Church
leaders. God depends upon them, employs them and blesses them.
</p>
<p>
Prayer cannot be retired as a secondary force in this world. To do so is to retire God from the movement. It is
to make God secondary. The-prayer-ministry is an all-engaging force. It must be so, to be a force at all. Prayer
is the sense of God's need and the call for God's help to supply that need. The estimate and place of prayer is
the estimate and place of God. To give prayer the secondary place is to make God secondary in life's affairs.
</p>
<p>
To substitute other forces for prayer,retires God and materializes the whole movement. Prayer is an absolute
necessity to the proper carrying on of God's work. God has made it so. This must have been the principal
reason why in the early Church, when the complaint that the widows of certain believers had been neglected in
the daily administration of the Church's benefactions, that the twelve called the disciples together, and told
them to look out for seven men, full of the Holy Ghost, and wisdom, who they would appoint over that
benevolent work, adding this important statement, "But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the
ministry of the Word." They surely realized that the success of the Word and the progress of the Church were
dependent in a preeminent sense upon their " giving themselves to prayer." God could effectively work
through them in proportion as they gave themselves fully to prayer. The Apostles were as dependent upon
prayer as other folks. Sacred work, - Church activities - may so engage and absorb us as to hinder praying,
and when this is the case, evil results always follow. It is better to let the work go by default than to let the
praying go by neglect. Whatever affects the intensity of our praying affects the value of our work. " Too busy
to pray " is not only the keynote to backsliding, but it mars even the work done. Nothing is well done without
prayer for the simple reason that it leaves God out of the account. It is so easy to be seduced by the good to
the neglect of the best, until both the good and the best perish. How easily may men, even leaders in Zion, be
led by the insidious wiles of Satan to cut short our praying in the interests of the work! How easy to neglect
prayer or abbreviate our praying simply by the plea that we have Church work on our hands. Satan has
effectively disarmed us when he can keep us too busy doing things to stop and pray. "Give ourselves
continually to prayer and the ministry of the word." The Revised Version has it, "We will continue steadfastly
in prayer." The implication of the word used here means to be strong, steadfast, to be devoted to, to keep at it
with constant care, to make a business out of it. We find the same word in Colossians 4:12, and in Romans
12:12, which is translated, "Continuing instant in prayer."
</p>
<p>
The Apostles were under the law of prayer, which law recognizes God as God, and depends upon Him to do
for them what He would not do without prayer. They were under the necessity of prayer, just as all believers
are, in every age and in every clime. They had to be devoted to prayer in order to make their ministry of the
Word efficient. The business of preaching is worth very little without it be in direct partnership with the
business of praying. Apostolic preaching cannot be carried on unless there be apostolic praying. Alas, that
this plain truth has been so easily forgotten by those who minister in holy things! Without in any way passing
a criticism on the ministry, we feel it to be high time that somebody or other declared to its members that
effective preaching is conditioned on effective praying. The preaching which is most successful is that
ministry which has much of prayer in it. Perhaps one might go so far as to say that it is the only kind that is
successful. God can mightily use the preacher who prays. He is God's chosen messenger for good, whom the
Holy Spirit delights to honour, God's efficient agent in saving men and in edifying the saints. In Acts 6:1-8 we
have the record of how, long ago, the Apostles felt that they were losing - had lost - in apostolic power
because they did not have relief from certain duties in order that they might give themselves more to prayer.
</p>
<p>
So they called a halt because they discovered to their regret that they were too deficient in praying. Doubtless
they kept up the form of praying, but it was seriously defective in intensity and in point of the amount of time
given to it. Their minds were too much preoccupied with the finances of the Church.
</p>
<p>
Just as in this day we find in many places both laymen and ministers are so busily engaged in " serving
tables," that they are glaringly deficient in praying. In fact in present-day Church affairs men are looked upon
as religious because they give largely of their money to the Church, and men are chosen for official positions
not because they are men of prayer, but because they have the financial ability to run Church finances and to
get money for the Church.
</p>
<p>
Now these Apostles, when they looked into this matter, determined to put aside these hindrances growing out
of Church finances, and resolved to "give themselves to prayer." Not that these finances were to be ignored or
set aside, but ordinary laymen, "full of faith and the Holy Ghost could be found, really religious men, who
could easily attend to this money business without in the least affecting their piety or their praying, thus giving
them something to do in the Church, and at the same time taking the burden from the Apostles who would be
able now to pray more, and praying more, to be blessed themselves in soul, and at the same time to more
effectually do the work to which they had been called.
</p>
<p>
They realized, too, as they had not realized before, that they were being so pressed by attention to material
things, things right in themselves, that they could not give to prayer that strength, ardour, and time which its
nature and importance demanded. And so we will discover, under close scrutiny of ourselves sometimes, that
things legitimate, things right in themselves, things commendable, may so engross our attention, so preoccupy
our minds and so draw on our feelings, that prayer may be omitted, or at least very little time may be given to
prayer. How easy to slip away from the closet! Even the Apostles had to guard themselves at that point. How
much do we need to watch ourselves at the same place! Things legitimate and right may become wrong when
they take the place of prayer. Things right in themselves may become wrong things when they are allowed to
fasten themselves inordinately upon our hearts. It is not only the sinful things which hurt prayer. It is not
alone questionable things which are to be guarded against. But it is things which are right in their places, but
which are allowed to sidetrack prayer and shut the closet door, often with the self-comforting plea that "we are
too busy to pray."
</p>
<p>
Possibly this has had as much to do with the breaking down of family prayer in this age as any other one
cause. It is at this point that family religion has decayed, and just here is one cause of the decline of the
prayer meeting. Men and women are too busy with legitimate things to "give themselves to prayer." Other
things are given the right of way. Prayer is set aside or made secondary. Business comes first. And this means
not always that prayer is second, but that prayer is put entirely out. The Apostles drove directly at this point,
and determined that even Church business should not affect their praying habits. Prayer must come first. Then
would they be in deed and truth God's real agents in His world, through whom He could effectually work,
because they were praying men, and thereby put themselves directly in line with His plans and purposes,
which was that He works through praying men. When the complaint came to their ears the Apostles discovered
that that which they had been doing did not fully serve the divine ends of peace, gratitude, and unity, but
discontent, complainings, and division were the result of their work, which had far too little prayer in it. And
so prayer was put prominently to the front.
</p>
<p>
Praying men are a necessity in carrying out the divine plan for the salvation of men. God has made it so. He it
is who established prayer as a divine ordinance, and this implies men are to do the praying. So that praying
men are a necessity in the world. The fact that so often God has employed men of prayer to accomplish His
ends clearly proves the proposition. It is altogether unnecessary to name all the instances where God used the
prayers of righteous men to carry out His gracious designs. Time and space are too limited for the list. Yet
one or two cases might be named. In the case of the golden calf, when God purposed to destroy the Israelites
because of their great sin of idolatry, at the time when Moses was receiving the law at God's hands, the very
being of Israel was imperilled, for Aaron had been swept away by the strong popular tide of unbelief and sin.
</p>
<p>
All seemed lost but Moses and prayer, and prayer became more efficient and wonder-working in behalf of
Israel than Aaron's magic rod. God was determined on the destruction of Israel and Aaron. His anger waxed
hot. It was a fearful and a critical hour. But prayer was the levee which held back heaven's desolating fury.
</p>
<p>
God's hand was held fast by the interceding of Moses, the mighty intercessor. Moses was set on delivering
Israel. It was with him a long and exhaustive struggle of praying for forty days and forty nights. Not for one
moment did he relax his hold on God. Not for one moment did he quit his place at the feet of God, even for
food. Not for one moment did he moderate his demand or ease his cry. Israel's existence was in the balance.
</p>
<p>
Almighty God's wrath must be stayed. Israel must be saved at all hazards. And Israel was saved. Moses
would not let God alone. And so, to-day, we can look back and give the credit of the present race of the Jews
to the praying of Moses centuries ago.
</p>
<p>
Persevering prayer always wins; God yields to importunity and fidelity. He has no heart to say No to such
praying as Moses did. Actually God's purpose to destroy Israel is changed by the praying of this man of God.
</p>
<p>
It is but an illustration of how much just one praying is worth in this world, and how much depends upon him.
</p>
<p>
When Daniel in Babylon, refused to obey the decree of the king not to ask any petition of any god or man for
thirty days, he shut his eyes to the decree which would shut him off from his praying room, and refused to be
deterred from calling upon God from fear of the consequences. So he "kneeled upon his knees three times a
day " and prayed as he had before done, leaving it all with God as to the consequences of thus disobeying the
king.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing impersonal about Daniel's praying. It always had an objective, and was an appeal to a great
God, who could do all things. There was no coddling of self, nor looking after subjective or reflex influences.
</p>
<p>
In the face of the dreadful decree which is to precipitate him from place and power, into the lion's den, "he
kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and gave thanks to God as aforetime." The gracious result was that
prayer laid its hands upon an Almighty arm, which interposed in that den of vicious, cruel lions and closed
their mouths and preserved His servant Daniel, who had been true to Him and who had called upon Him for
protection. Daniel's praying was an essential factor in defeating the king's decree and in discomfiting the
wicked, envious rulers, who had set the trap for Daniel in order to destroy him and remove him from place
and power in the kingdom.

<h1 class="caption">II. PUTTING GOD TO WORK</h1>
       <blockquote>"For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
       neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth
       for him."
       <div class="sig">-- Isaiah 64:4</div></blockquote>
<p>
THE assertion voiced in the title given this is but another way of declaring that God has of His own motion
placed Himself under the law of prayer, and has obligated Himself to answer the prayers of men. He has
ordained prayer as a means whereby He will do things through men as they pray, which He would not
otherwise do. Prayer is a specific divine appointment an ordinance of heaven, whereby God purposes to carry
out His gracious designs on earth and to execute and make efficient the plan of salvation. When we say that
prayer puts God to work, it is simply to say that man has it in his power by prayer to move God to work in His
own way among men, in which way He would not work if prayer was not made. Thus while prayer moves God
to work, at the same time God puts prayer to work. As God has ordained prayer, and as prayer has no
existence separate from men, but involves men, then logically prayer is the one force which puts God to work
in earth's affairs through men and their prayers. Let these fundamental truths concerning God and prayer be
kept in mind in all allusions to prayer, and in all our reading of the incidents of prayer in the Scriptures. If
prayer puts God to work on earth, then, by the same token, prayerlessness rules God out of the world's affairs,
and prevents Him from working. And if prayer moves God to work in this world's affairs, then prayerlessness
excludes God from everything concerning men, and leaves man on earth the mere creature of circumstances,
at the mercy of blind fate or without help of any kind from God. It leaves man in this world with its
tremendous responsibilities and its difficult problems, and with all of its sorrows, burdens and afflictions,
without any God at all. In reality the denial of prayer is a denial of God Himself, for God and prayer are so
inseparable that they can never be divorced.
</p>
<p>
Prayer affects three different spheres of existence - the divine, the angelic and the human. It puts God to work,
it puts angels to work, and it puts man to work. It lays its hands upon God, angels and men. What a wonderful
reach there is in prayer! It brings into play the forces of heaven and earth. God, angels and men are subjects of
this wonderful law of prayer, and all these have to do with the possibilities and the results of prayer. God has
so far placed Himself subject to prayer that by reason of His own appointment, He is induced to work among
men in a way in which He does not work if men do not pray. Prayer lays hold upon God and influences Him to
work. This is the meaning of prayer as it concerns God. This is the doctrine of prayer, or else there is nothing
whatever in prayer. Prayer puts God to work in all things prayed for. While man in his weakness and poverty
waits, trusts and prays, God undertakes the work. "For from old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee, which worketh for him that waiteth for thee." Jesus Christ
commits Himself to the force of prayer. "Whatsoever ye ask in My Name," He says, "that will I do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My Name, I will do it." And again: 'If ye abide
in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you." To no other
energy is the promise of God committed as to that of prayer. Upon no other force are the purposes of God so
dependent as this one of prayer. The Word of God dilates on the results and necessity of prayer. The work of
God stays or advances as prayer puts forth its strength. Prophets and apostles have urged the utility, force and
necessity of prayer. "I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day
nor night. Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till
he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth." Prayer, with its antecedents and attendants, is the one and only
condition of the final triumph of the Gospel. It is the one and only condition which honours the Father and
glorifies the Son. Little and poor praying has weakened Christ's power on earth, postponed the glorious results
of His reign, and retired God from His sovereignty. Prayer puts God's work in His hands, and keeps it there. It
looks to Him constantly and depends on Him implicitly to further His own cause. Prayer is but faith resting
in, acting with, and leaning on and obeying God. This is why God loves it so well, why He puts all power into
its hands, and why He so highly esteems. men of prayer.
</p>
<p>
Every movement for the advancement of the Gospel must be created by and inspired by prayer. In all these
movements of God, prayer precedes and attends as an invariable and necessary condition. In this relation,
God makes prayer identical in force and power with Himself, and says to those on earth who pray: "You are
on the earth to carry on My cause. I am in heaven, the Lord of all, the Maker of all, the Holy One of all. Now
whatever you need for My cause, ask Me and I will do it. Shape the future by your prayers, and all that you
need for present supplies, command Me. I made heaven and earth, and all things in them. Ask largely. Open
thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. It is MY work which you are doing. It concerns My cause. Be prompt and
full in praying. Do not abate your asking, and I will not wince nor abate in My giving." Everywhere in His
Word God conditions His actions on prayer. Everywhere in His Word His actions and attitude are shaped by
prayer. To quote all the Scriptural passages which prove the immediate, direct and personal relation of prayer
to God, would be to transfer whole pages of the Scripture to this study. Man has personal relations with God.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is the divinely appointed means by which man comes into direct connection with God. By His own
ordinance God holds Himself bound to hear prayer. God bestows His great good on His children when they
seek it along the avenue of prayer. When Solomon closed his great prayer which he offered at the dedication
of the Temple, God appeared to him, approved him, and laid down the universal principles of His action. In II
Chronicles 7:12-15 we read as follows: And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him, I have
heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself, for a house of sacrifice. "If I shut up heaven that there
be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among the people; if my
people which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now my eyes
shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place." In His purposes concerning the
Jews in the Babylonish captivity (Jer. 29:10-13) God asserts His unfailing principles: For thus saith the Lord,
that after seventy years be accomplished, at Babylon, I will visit you, and perform MY good word toward you,
in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts
of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray
unto me, and I will hearken unto You. And ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with
all your heart."
</p>
<p>
In Bible terminology prayer means calling upon God for things we desire, asking things of God. Thus we
read: " Call upon me and I will answer thee, and will show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest
not" (Jer. 33:3). "Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I Will deliver thee" (Ps. 50:15). "Then shalt thou
call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am" (Isa. 58:9). Prayer is revealed as a
direct application to God for some temporal or spiritual good. It is an appeal to God to intervene in life's affairs
for the good of those for whom we pray. God is recognized as the source and fountain of all good, and prayer
implies that all His good is held in His keeping for those who call upon Him in truth. That prayer is an
application to God, intercourse with God, and communion with God, comes out strongly and simply in the
praying of Old Testament saints. Abraham's intercession for Sodom is a striking illustration of the nature of
prayer, intercourse with God, and showing the intercessory side of prayer. The declared purpose of God to
destroy Sodom confronted Abraham, and his soul within him was greatly moved because of his great interest in
that fated city. His nephew and family resided there. That purpose of God must be changed. God's decree for
the destruction of this evil city's inhabitants must be revoked. It was no small undertaking which faced
Abraham when he conceived the idea of beseeching God to spare Sodom. Abraham sets himself to change
God's purpose and to save Sodom with the other cities of the plain. It was certainly a most difficult and
delicate work for him to undertake to throw his influence with God in favour of those doomed cities so as to
save them. He bases his plea on the simple fact of the number of righteous men who could be found in Sodom,
and appeals to the infinite rectitude of God not to destroy the righteous with the wicked. "That be far from
thee to slay the righteous with the wicked. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" With what deep
self-abasement and reverence does Abraham enter upon his high and divine work! He stood before God in
solemn awe, and meditation, and then drew near to God and spake. He advanced step by step in faith, in
demand and urgency, and God granted every request which he made. It has been well said that "Abraham left
off asking before God left off granting." It seems that Abraham had a kind of optimistic view of the piety of
Sodom. He scarcely expected when he undertook this matter to have it end in failure. He was greatly in
earnest, and had every encouragement to press his case. In his final request he surely thought that with Lot,
his wife, his daughters, his sons, and his sons-in-law, he had his ten righteous persons for whose sake God
would spare the city. But alas! The count failed when the final test- came. There were not ten righteous people
in that large population. But this was true. If he did not save Sodom by his importunate praying, the purposes
of God were stayed for a season, and possibly had not Abraham's goodness of heart over-estimated the
number of pious people in that devoted city, God might have saved it had he reduced his figures still further.
</p>
<p>
This is a representative case illustrative of Old Testament praying, and disclosing God's mode of working
through prayer. It shows further how God is moved to work in answer to prayer in this world even when it
comes to changing His purposes concerning a sinful community. This praying of Abraham was no mere
performance, no dull, lifeless ceremony, but an earnest plea, a strong advocacy, to secure a desired end, to
have an influence, one person with another person.
</p>
<p>
How full of meaning is this series of remarkable intercessions made by Abraham! Here we have arguments
designed to convince God, and pleas to persuade God to change His purpose. We see deep humility, but holy
boldness as well, perseverance, and advances made based on victory in each petition. Here we have enlarged
asking encouraged by enlarged answers. God stays and answers as long as Abraham stays and asks. To
Abraham God is existent, approachable, and all powerful, but at the same time He defers to men, acts
favourably on their desires, and grants them favours asked for. Not to pray is a denial of God, a denial of His
existence, a denial of His nature, and a denial of His purposes toward mankind. God has specifically to do
with prayer promises in their breadth, certainty and limitations. Jesus Christ presses us into the presence of
God with these prayer promises, not only by the assurance that God will answer, but that no other being but
God can answer. He presses us to God because only in this way can we move God to take a hand in earth's
affairs, and induce Him to intervene in our behalf. "All things whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall
receive," says Jesus, and this allcomprehensive condition not only presses us to pray for all things, everything
great and small, but it sets us on and shuts us up to God, for who but God can cover the illimitable of
universal things, and can assure us certainly of receiving the very thing for which we may ask in all the
Thesaurus of earthly and heavenly good? It is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who makes demands on us to pray,
and it is He who puts Himself and all He has so fully in the answer. He it is who puts Himself at our service
and answers our demands when we pray.
</p>
<p>
And just as He puts Himself and the Father at our command in prayer, to come directly into our lives and to
work for our good, so also does He engage to answer the demands of two or more believers who are agreed
as touching any one thing. "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything, that they shall ask, it shall
be done for them of my Father which is in heaven." None but God could put Himself in a covenant so binding
as that, for God only could fulfil such a promise and could reach to its exacting and all controlling demands.
</p>
<p>
God only can answer for the promises.
</p>
<p>
God needs prayer, and man needs prayer, too. It is indispensable to God's work in this world, and is essential
to getting God to work in earth' affairs. So God binds men to pray by the most solemn obligations. God
commands men to pray, and so not to pray is plain disobedience to an imperative command of Almighty God.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is such a condition without which the graces, the salvation and the good of God are not bestowed on
men. Prayer is a high privilege, a royal prerogative and manifold and eternal are the losses by failure to
exercise it. Prayer is the great, universal force to advance God's cause; the reverence which hallows God's
name; the ability to do God's will, and the establishment of God's kingdom in the hearts of the children of
men. These, and their coincidents and agencies, are created and affected by prayer. One of the constitutional
enforcements of the Gospel is prayer. Without prayer, the Gospel can neither be preached effectively,
promulgated faithfully, experienced in the heart, nor be practiced in the life. And for the very simple reason
that by leaving prayer out of the catalogue of religious duties, we leave God out, and His work cannot
progress without Him. The movements which God purposed under Cyrus, king of Persia, prophesied about
by Isaiah many years before Cyrus was born, are conditioned on prayer. God declares His purpose, power,
independence and defiance of obstacles in the way of Him carrying out those purposes. His omnipotent and
absolutely infinite power is set to encourage prayer. He has been ordering all events, directing all conditions,
and creating all things, that He might answer prayer, and then turns Himself over to His praying ones to be
commanded. And then all the results and power He holds in His hands will be bestowed in lavish and
unmeasured munificence to carry out prayers and to make prayer the mightiest energy in the world. The
passage in Isaiah (46) is too lengthy to be quoted in its entirety but it is well worth reading. It closes with such
strong words as these, words about prayer, which are the climax of all which God has been saying concerning
His purposes in connection with Cyrus: Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of
things to come, concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me. I have made the
earth, and created man upon it; I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their hosts have I
commanded." In the conclusion of the history of Job, we see how God intervenes in behalf of Job and calls
upon his friends to present themselves before Job that he may pray for them. "My wrath is kindled against
thee and against thy two friends," is God's statement, with the further words added, "My servant Job shall pray
for you, for him will I accept," a striking illustration of God intervening to deliver Job's friends in answer to
Job's prayer.
</p>
<p>
We have heretofore spoken of prayer affecting God, angels and men. Christ wrote nothing while living.
</p>
<p>
Memoranda, notes, sermon writing, sermon making, were alien to Him. Autobiography was not to His taste.
</p>
<p>
The Revelation of John was His last utterance. In that book we have pictured the great importance, the
priceless value, and the high position which prayer obtains in the movements history, and unfolding progress
of God's Church in this world. We have this picture in Revelation 8:3, disclosing the interest the angels in
heaven have in the prayers of the saints and in accomplishing the answers to those prayers: "And another
angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much incense, that he
should offer it with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke
of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God, out of the angel's hand. And
the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices,
and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake." Translated into the prose of everyday life, these words
show how the capital stock by which heaven carries on the business of salvation under Christ, is made up of
the prayers of God's saints on earth, and discloses how these prayers in flaming power come back to earth and
produce its mighty commotions, influences and revolutions. Praying men are essential to Almighty God in all
His plans and purposes. God's secrets, councils and cause have never been committed to prayerless men.
</p>
<p>
Neglect of prayer has always brought loss of faith, loss of love, and loss of prayer. Failure to pray has been
the baneful, inevitable cause of backsliding and estrangement from God. Prayerless men have stood in the
way of God fulfilling His Word and doing His will on earth. They tie divine hands and interfere with God in
His gracious designs. As praying men are a help to God, so prayerless men are a hindrance to Him. We press
the Scriptural view of the necessity of prayer, even at the cost of repetition. The subject is too important for
repetition to weaken or tire, too vital to be trite or tame. We must feel it anew. The fires of prayer have
burned low. Ashes and not flames are on its altars.
</p>
<p>
No insistence in the Scriptures is more pressing than prayer. No exhortation is oftener reiterated, none is more
hearty, none is more solemn and stirring, than to pray. No principle is more strongly and broadly declared
than that which urges us to prayer. There is no duty to which we are more strongly obliged than the obligation
to pray. There is no command more imperative and insistent than that of praying.
</p>
<p>
Art thou praying in everything without ceasing, in the closet, hidden from the eyes of men, and praying
always and everywhere? That is the personal, pertinent and all-important question for every soul. Many
instances occur in God's Word showing that God intervenes in this world in answer to prayer. Nothing is
clearer when the Bible is consulted than that Almighty God is brought directly into the things of this world by
the praying of His people. Jonah flees from duty and takes ship for a distant port. But God follows him, and
by a strange providence this disobedient prophet is cast out of the vessel, and theGod who sent him to
Nineveh prepares a fish to swallow him. In the fish's belly he cries out to the God against whom he had sinned,
and God intervenes and causes the fish to vomit Jonah out on dry land. Even the fishes of the great deep are
subject to the law of prayer. Likewise the birds of the air are brought into subjection to this same law. Elijah
had foretold to Ahab the coming of that prolonged drought, and food and even water became scarce. God sent
him to the brook Cherith, and said unto him, " It shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there. And the ravens brought bread and flesh in the morning and bread
and flesh in the evening." Can any one doubt that this man of God, who later on shut up and opened the rain
clouds by prayer was not praying about this time, when so much was at stake? God interposed among the
birds of the air this time and strangely moved them to take care of His servant so that he would not want food
and water. David in an evil hour, instead of listening to the advice of Joab, his prime minister, yielded to the
suggestion of Satan, and counted the people, which displeased God. So God told him to choose one of three
evils as a retribution for his folly and sin. Pestilence came among the people in violent form, and David
betakes himself to prayer. "And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered?
Even I it is that hath sinned and done evil indeed. But as for these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I
pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people; that they should be
plagued" (I Chron. 21:17). And though God had been greatly grieved at David for numbering Israel, yet He
could not resist this appeal of a penitent and prayerful spirit, and God was moved by prayer to put His hand on
the springs of disease and stop the fearful plague. God was put to work by David's prayer.
</p>
<p>
Numbers of other cases could be named. These are sufficient. God seems to have taken great pains in His
divine revelation to men to show how He interferes in earth's affairs in answer to the praying of His saints.
</p>
<p>
The question might arise just here in some over-critical minds as to the so-called "laws of nature," who are not
strong believers in prayer, as there was a conflict between what they call the "laws of nature" and the law of
prayer. These people make nature a sort of imaginary god entirely separate of Almighty God. What is nature
anyway? It is but the creation of God, the Maker of all things. And what are the "laws of nature" but the laws
of God, through which He governs the material world. As the law of prayer is also the law of God, there
cannot possibly be any conflict between the two sets of laws, but all must work in perfect harmony. Prayer
does not violate any natural law. God may set aside one law for the higher working of another law, and this
He may do when He answers prayer. Or Almighty God may answer prayer working through the course of
natural law. But whether or not we understand it, God is over and above all nature, and can and will answer
prayer in a wise, intelligent and just manner, even though man may not comprehend it. So that in no sense is
there any discord or conflict between God's several laws when God is induced to interfere with human affairs
in answer to prayer. In this connection another word might be said. We used the form of words to which there
can be no objection, that prayer does certain things, but this of course implies not that prayer as a human
means accomplishes anything, but that prayer only accomplishes things instrumentally. Prayer is the
instrument, God is the efficient and active agent. So that prayer in itself does not interfere in earth's affairs,
but prayer in the hands of men moves God to intervene and do things, which He would not otherwise do if
prayer was not used as the instrument. It is as we say, "faith hath saved thee," by which is simply meant that
God through the faith of the sinner saves him, faith being only the instrument used by the sinner which brings
salvation to him.

<h1 class="caption">III. THE NECESSITY FOR PRAYING MEN</h1>
<blockquote>       "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto
       with all perseverance and supplication for all saints."
       <div class="sig">-- Ephesians 6: 18</div>

</blockquote>
<p>
ONE of the crying things of our day is for men whose faith, prayers and study of the Word of God have been
vitalized, and a transcript of that Word is written on their hearts and who will give it forth as the incorruptible
seed that liveth and abideth forever. Nothing more is needed to clear up the haze by which a critical unfaith
has eclipsed the Word of God than the fidelity of the pulpit in its unwavering allegiance to the Bible and the
fearless proclamation of its truth.
</p>
<p>
Without this the standard-bearer fails, and wavering and confusion all along the ranks follow. The pulpit has
wrought its mightiest work in the days of its unswerving loyalty to the Word of God. In close connection with
this, must we have men of prayer, men in high and low places who hold to and practice Scriptural praying.
</p>
<p>
While the pulpit must hold to its unswerving loyalty to the Word of God, it must, at the same time, be loyal to
the doctrine of prayer which that same Word illustrates and enforces upon mankind. Schools, colleges and
education considered simply as such cannot be regarded as being leaders in carrying forward the work of
God's kingdom in the world. They have neither the right, the will nor the power to do the work. This is to be
accomplished by the preached Word, delivered in the power of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, sown
with prayerful hands, and watered with the tears of praying hearts. This is the divine law, and so "nominated
in the bond." We are shut up and sealed to it - we would follow the Lord. Men are demanded for the great
work of soul saving, and men must go. It is no angelic or impersonal force which is needed. Human hearts
baptized with the spirit of prayer, must bear the burden of this message, and human tongues on fire as the
result of earnest, persistent prayer, must declare the Word of God to dying men. The Church, today, needs
praying men to execute her solemn and pressing responsibility meet the fearful crisis which is facing her. The
crying need of the times is for men, in increased numbers - God-fearing men, praying men, Holy Ghost men,
men who can endure hardness, who will count not their lives dear unto themselves, but count all things but
dross for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Saviour. The men who are so greatly needed in
this age of the Church are those who have learned the business of praying, learned it upon their knees, learned
it in the need and agony of their own hearts. Praying men are the one commanding need of this day, as of all
other days, in which God is to have or make a showing. Men who pray are, in reality, the only religious men,
and it takes a full-measured man to pray. Men of prayer are the only men who do or can represent God in this
world. No cold, irreligious, prayerless man can claim the right. They misrepresent God in all His work, and all
His plans. Praying men are the only men who have influence with God, the only kind of men to whom God
commits Himself and His Gospel. Praying men are the only men in which the Holy Spirit dwells, for the Holy
Spirit and prayer go hand in hand. The Holy Spirit never descends upon prayerless men. He never fills them,
He never empowers them. There is nothing whatever in common between the Spirit of God and men who do
not pray. The Spirit dwells only in a prayer atmosphere. In doing God's work there is no substitute for praying.
</p>
<p>
The men of prayer cannot be displaced with other kinds of men. Men of financial skill, men of education, men
of worldly influence - none of these can possibly be put in substitution for the men of prayer. The life, the
vigour, the motivepower of God's work is formed by praying men. A vitally diseased heart is not a more
fearful Symptom of approaching death than non-praying men are of spiritual atrophy.
</p>
<p>
The men to whom Jesus Christ committed the fortunes and destiny of His Church were men of prayer. To no
other kind of men has God ever committed Himself in this world. The Apostles were preeminently men of
prayer. They gave themselves to prayer. They made praying their chief business. It was first in point of
importance and first in results. God never has, and He never will, commit the weighty interests of His
kingdom to prayerless men, who do not make prayer a conspicuous and controlling factor in their lives. Men
never rise to any eminence of piety who do not pray. Men of piety are always men of prayer. Men are never
noted for the simplicity and strength of their faith who are not preeminently men of prayer. Piety flourishes
nowhere so rapidly and so rankly as in the closet. The closet is the garden of faith. The Apostles allowed no
duty, however sacred, to so engage them as to infringe upon their time and prevent them from making prayer
the main thing. The Word of God was ministered by apostolic fidelity and zeal. It was spoken by men with
apostolic commissions and whose heads the fiery tongues of Pentecost had baptized. The Word was pointless
and powerless without they were freshly endued with power by continuous and mighty prayer. The seed of
God's Word must be' saturated in prayer to make it germinate. It grows readier and roots deeper when it is
prayer-soaked. The Apostles were praying men, themselves. They were teachers of prayer, and trained their
disciples in the school of prayer. They urged prayer upon their disciples not only that they might attain to the
loftiest eminence of faith, but that they might be the most powerful factors in advancing God's kingdom. Jesus
Christ was the divinely appointed leader of God's people, and no one thing in His life proves His eminent
fitness for that office so fully as His habit of prayer. Nothing is more suggestive of thought than Christ's
continual praying, and nothing is more conspicuous about Him than prayer. His campaigns were arranged,
His victories gained, in the struggles and communion of His all-night praying. His praying rent the heavens.
</p>
<p>
Moses and Elijah and the Transfiguration glory waited on His praying. His miracles and His teaching had their
force from the same source. Gethsemane's praying crimsoned Calvary with serenity and glory. His prayer
makes the history and hastens the triumphs of His Church. What an inspiration and command to prayer is
Christ's life! What a comment on its worth! How He shames our lives by His praying! Like all His followers
who have drawn God nearer to the world and lifted the world nearer to God, Jesus was the man of prayer,
made of God a leader and commander to His people. His leadership was one of prayer. A great leader He was,
because He was great in prayer. All great leaders for God have fashioned their leadership in the wrestlings of
their closets. Many great men have led and moulded the Church who have not been great in prayer, but they
were great only in their plans, great for their opinions, great for their organization, great by natural gifts, by the
force of genius or of character. However, they were not great for God. But Jesus Christ was a great leader for
God. His was the great leadership of great praying. God was in His leadership greatly because prayer was in it
greatly. We might just well express the wish that we be taught by Him to pray, and to pray more and more.
</p>
<p>
Herein has been the secret of the men of prayer in the past history of the Church. Their hearts were after God,
their desires were on Him, their prayers were addressed to Him. They communed with Him, sought nothing of
the world, sought great things of God, wrestled with Him, conquered all opposing forces, and opened up the
channel of faith deep and broad between them and heaven. And all this was done by the use of prayer. Holy
meditations, spiritual desires, heavenly drawings, swayed their intellects, enriched their emotions, and filled
and enlarged their hearts. And all this was so because they were first of all men of prayer. The men who have
thus communed with God and who have sought after Him with their whole hearts have always risen to
consecrated eminence, and no man has ever risen to this eminence whose flames of holy desire have not all
been dead to the world and all aglow for God and heaven. Nor have they ever risen to the heights of the
higher spiritual experiences unless prayer and the spirit of prayer have been conspicuous and controlling
factors in their lives. The entire consecration of many of God's children stands out distinctly like towering
mountain peaks. Why is this? How did they ascend to these heights? What brought them so near to God?
What made them so Christ-like? The answer is easy - prayer. They prayed much, prayed long, and drank
deeper and deeper still. They asked, they sought, and they knocked, till heaven opened its richest inner
treasures of grace to them. Prayer was the Jacob's Ladder by which they scaled those holy and blessed heights,
and the way by which the angels of God came down to and ministered to them. The men of spiritual mould and
might always value prayer. They took time to be alone with God. Their praying was no hurried performance.
</p>
<p>
They had many serious wants to be relieved, and many weighty pleas they had to offer. Many large supplies
they must secure. They had to do much silent waiting before God, and much patient iteration and reiteration to
utter to Him. Prayer was the only channel through which supplies came, and was the only way to utter pleas.
</p>
<p>
The only acceptable waiting before God of which they knew anything was prayer. They valued praying. It
was more precious to them than all jewels, more excellent than any good, more to be valued than the greatest
good of earth. They esteemed it, valued it, prized it, and did it. They pressed it to its farthest limits, tested its
greatest results, and secured its most glorious patrimony. To them prayer was the one great thing to
beappreciated and used.
</p>
<p>
The Apostles above everything else were praying men, and left the impress of their prayer example and
teaching upon the early Church. But the Apostles are dead, and times and men have changed. They have no
successors by official entail or heirship. And the times have no commission to make other apostles. Prayer is
the entail to spiritual and apostolical leadership. Unfortunately the times are not prayerful times. God's cause
just now needs very greatly praying leaders. Other things may be needed, but above all else this is the crying
demand of these times and the urgent first need of the Church. This is the day of great wealth in the Church
and of wonderful material resources. But unfortunately the affluence of material resources is a great enemy
and a severe hindrance to strong spiritual forces. It is an invariable law that the presence of attractive and
potent material forces creates a trust in them, and by the same inevitable law, creates distrust in the spiritual
forces of the Gospel. They are two masters which cannot be served at one and the same time. For just in
proportion as the mind is fixed on one, will it be drawn away from the other. The days of great financial
prosperity in the Church have not been days of great religious prosperity. Moneyed men and praying - men
are not synonymous terms.
</p>
<p>
Paul in the second of his First Epistle to Timothy, emphasizes the need of men to pray. Church leaders in his
estimation are to be conspicuous for their praying. Prayer ought and must of necessity shape their characters,
and must be one of their distinguishing characteristics. Prayer ought to be one of their most powerful elements,
so much so that it cannot be hid. Prayer ought to make Church leaders notable. Character, official duty,
reputation and life, all should be shaped by prayer. The mighty forces of prayer lie in its praying leaders in a
marked way. The standing obligation to pray rests in a peculiar sense on Church leaders. Wise will the Church
be to discover this prime truth and give prominence to it. It may be laid down as an axiom, that God needs,
first of all, leaders in the Church who will be first in prayer, men with whom prayer is habitual and
characteristic, men who know the primacy of prayer. But even more than a habit of prayer, and more than
prayer being characteristic of them, Church leaders are to be impregnated with prayer - men whose lives are
made and moulded by prayer, whose heart and life are made up of prayer. These are the men - the only men -
God can use in the furtherance of His kingdom and the implanting of His message inthe hearts of men.
</p>

</div> 


<div class="chapter">
<h1 class="caption">IV. GOD'S NEED OF MEN WHO PRAY</h1>
<p>
WE proceed now to declare that it demands prayer-leadership to hold the Church to God's aims, and to fit it
for God's uses. Prayer-leadership preserves the spirituality of the Church, just as prayerless leaders make for
unspiritual conditions. The Church is not spiritual simply by the mere fact of its existence, nor by its vocation.
</p>
<p>
It is not held to its sacred vocation by generation, nor by succession. Like the new birth, " It is not of blood,
neither of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." The Church is not spiritual simply because it is
concerned and deals in spiritual values. It may hold its confirmations by the thousand, it may multiply its
baptisms, and administer its sacraments innumerable times, and yet be as far from fulfilling its true mission as
human conditions can make it. This present world's general attitude retires prayer to insignificance and
obscurity. By it, salvation and eternal life are put in the background. It cannot be too often affirmed,
therefore, that the prime need of the Church is not men of money nor men of brains, but men of prayer.
</p>
<p>
Leaders in the realm of religious activity are to be judged by their praying habits, and not by their money or
social position. Those who must be placed in the forefront of the Church's business, must be, first of all, men
who know how to pray.
</p>
<p>
God does not conduct His work, solely, with men of education or of wealth or of business capacity. Neither
can He carry on His work through men of large intellects or of great culture, nor yet through men of great
social eminence and influence. All these can be made to count provided they are not regarded as being
primary. These men, by the simple fact of these qualities and conditions, cannot lead in God's work nor control
His cause. Men of prayer, before anything else, are indispensable to the furtherance of the kingdom of God on
earth. No other sort will fit in the scheme or do the deed. Men, great and influential in other things, but small
in prayer, cannot do the work Almighty God has set out for His Church to do in this, His world. Men who
represent God and who stand here in His stead, men who are to build up His kingdom in this world, must be in
an eminent sense men of prayer. Whatever else they may have, whatever else they may lack, they must be
men of prayer. Having everything else and lacking prayer, they must fail. Having prayer and lacking all else,
they can succeed. Prayer must be the most conspicuous and the most potent factor in the character and
conduct of men who undertake divine commission. God's business requires men who are versed in the
business of praying. It must be kept in mind that the praying to which the disciples of Christ is called by
Scriptural authority and enforcement, is a valorous calling, for manly men. The men God wants and upon
whom He depends, must work at prayer just as they work at their worldly calling. They must follow this
business of praying through, just as they do their secular pursuits. Diligence, perseverance. heartiness, and
courage, must all be in it if it is to succeed.
</p>
<p>
Everything secured by Gospel promise, defined by Gospel measure, and represented by Gospel treasure are to
be found in prayer. All heights are scaled by it, all doors are opened to it, all victories are gained through it,
and all grace distills on it. Heaven has all its good and all its help for men who pray. How marked and strong
is the injunction of Christ which sends men from the parade of public giving and praying to the privacy of
their closets, where with shut doors, and in encircling silence they are alone in prayer with God! In all ages,
those who have carried out the divine will on the earth, have been men of prayer. The days of prayer are God's
halcyon days. His heart, His oath, and His glory are committed to one issuance - that every knee should how
to Him. The day of the Lord, in a preeminent sense, will be a day of universal prayer. God's cause does not
suffer through lack of divine ability, but by reason of the lack of prayer ability in man. God's action is just as
much bound up in prayer at this time, as it was when He said to Abimelech, "Abraham shall pray for thee,
and thou shalt live." So also it was when God said to Job's friends, " My servant Job shall pray for you, for him
will I accept."
</p>
<p>
God's great plan for the redemption of mankind is as much bound up to prayer for its prosperity and success
as when the decree creating the movement was issued from the Father, bearing on its frontage the imperative,
universal and eternal condition, "Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance and the
uttermost part of the earth for thy possession." In many places an alarming state of things has come to pass, in
that the many who are enrolled in our churches are not praying men and women. Many of those occupying
prominent positions in church life are not praying men. It is greatly to feared that much of the work of the
Church is being done by those who are perfect strangers to the closet. Small wonder that the work does not
succeed. While it may be true that many in the Church say prayers, it is equally true that their praying is of the
stereotyped order. Their prayers may be charged with sentiment, but they are tame, timid, and without fire or
force. Even this sort of praying is done by a few straggling men to be found at prayer-meetings. Those whose
names are to be found bulking large in our great Church assemblies are not men noted for their praying habits.
</p>
<p>
Yet the entire fabric of the work in which they are engaged has, perforce, to depend on the adequacy of
prayer. This fact is similar to the crisis which would be created were a country to have to admit in the face of
an invading foe that it cannot fight and have no knowledge of the weapons whereby war is to be waged. In all
God's plans for human redemption, He proposes that men pray. The men are to pray in every place, in the
church, in the closet, in the home, on sacred days and on secular days. All things and everything are dependent
on the measure of men's praying. Prayer is the genius and mainspring of life. We pray as we live; we live as
we pray. Life will never be finer than the quality of the closet. The mercury of life will rise only by the
warmth of the closet. Persistent non-praying eventually will depress life below zero.
</p>
<p>
To measure and weigh the conditions of prayer, is readily to discover why men do not pray in larger numbers.
</p>
<p>
The conditions are so perfect, so blessed, that it is a rare character who can meet them. A heart all love, a heart
that holds even its enemies in loving contemplation and prayerful concern, a heart from which all bitterness,
revenge and envy are purged - how rare! Yet this is the only condition of mind and heart in which a man can
expect to command the efficacy of prayer. There are certain conditions laid down for authentic praying. Men
are to pray, " lifting up holy hands"; hands here being the symbol of life. Hands unsoiled by stains of evil
doing are the emblem of a life unsoiled by sin. Thus are men to come into the presence of God, thus are they to
approach the throne of the Highest, where they can "obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
</p>
<p>
Here, then, is one reason why men do not pray. They are too worldly in heart and too secular in life to enter
the closet; and even though they enter there, they cannot offer the fervent, effectual prayer of the righteous
man, which availeth much." Again, " hands " are the symbols of supplication. Outstretched hands stand for an
appeal for help. It is the silent yet eloquent attitude of a helpless soul standing before God, appealing for
mercy and grace. "Hands," too, are symbols of activity, power and conduct. Hands outstretched to God in
prayer must be holy hands, "unstained hands. The word "holy" here means undefiled, unspotted, untainted,
and religiously observing every obligation. How far remote is all this from the character of the sin-loving,
worldly-minded, fleshly disposed men, soiled by fleshly lusts, spotted by worldly indulgence, unholy in heart
and conduct! "He who seeks equity must do equity," is the maxim of earthly courts. So he who seeks God's
good gifts must practice God's good deeds. This is the maxim of heavenly courts.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is sensitive, and always affected by the character and conduct of him who prays. Water cannot rise
above its own level, and a spotless prayer cannot flow from a spotted heart. Straight praying is never born of
crooked conduct. The men, what men are, behind their praying, that gives character to their supplication. The
craven heart cannot do brave praying. Soiled men cannot make clean, pure supplication. It is neither words,
nor thoughts nor ideas, nor feelings, which shape praying, but character and conduct. Men must walk in
upright fashion in order to be able to pray well. Bad character and unrighteous living break down praying
until it becomes a mere shibboleth. Praying takes its tone and vigour from the life of the man or the woman
exercising it. When character and conduct are at a low ebb, praying can but barely live, much less thrive. The
man of prayer, whether layman or preacher, is God's right-hand man. In the realm of spiritual affairs, he
creates conditions, inaugurates movements, brings things to pass. By the fact and condition of their creation
and redemption, all men are under obligation to pray. Every man can pray, and every man should pray. But
when it comes to the affairs of the Kingdom, let it be said, at once, that a prayerless man in the Church of
God is like a paralysed organ of the physical body. He is out of place in the communion of saints, out of
harmony with God, and out of accord with His purposes for mankind. A prayerless man handicaps the vigour
and life of the whole system like a demoralized soldier is a menace to the force of which he forms part, in the
day of battle. The absence of prayer lessens all the life-forces of the soul, cripples faith, sets aside holy living,
shuts out heaven. Between praying saints and non-praying men, in Holy Scripture, the line is sharply drawn.
</p>
<p>
Of Fletcher of Madeley - one of the praying saints - it is written that He was far more abundant in his public
labours than the greater part of his companions in the holy ministry. Yet these bore but little proportion to
those internal exercises of prayer and supplication to which he was wholly given up in private, which were
almost uninterruptedly maintained from hour to hour. He lived in the spirit of prayer, and whatever
employment in which he was engaged, this spirit of prayer was constantly manifested through them all.
</p>
<p>
"Without this he neither formed any design, nor entered upon any duty. Without this he neither read nor
conversed. Without this, he neither visited nor received a visitor. There have been seasons of supplications in
which he appeared to be carried out far beyond the ordinary limits of devotion, when, like his Lord upon the
Mount of Transfiguration, while he continued to pour out his mighty prayer, the fashion of his countenance
has been changed, and his face has appeared as the face of an angel." God, raise up more men of praying like
John Fletcher! How we do need, in this our day, men through whom God can work!

      <div class="sig"> -- H. W. Hodge</div></blockquote>
<p>THERE is great need in this day for Christian business men to inform their mundane affairs with the spirit of
prayer. There is a great army of successful merchants of almost every kind who are members of Christ's
Church and it is high time these men attended to this matter. This is but another version of the phrase, "putting
God into business," the realization and restraint of His presence and of His fear in all the secularities of life.
</p>
<p>
We need the atmosphere of the prayer-closet to pervade our public salesrooms and counting-houses. The
sanctity of prayer is needed to impregnate business. We need the spirit of Sunday carried over to Monday and
continued until Saturday. But this cannot be done by prayerless men, but by men of prayer. We need business
men to go about their concerns with the same reverence and responsibility with which they enter the closet.
</p>
<p>
Men are badly needed who are devoid of greed, but who, with all their hearts, carry God with them into the
secular affairs of life. Men of the world imagine prayer to be too impotent a thing to come into rivalry with
business methods and worldly practices. Against such a misleading doctrine Paul sets the whole commands of
God, the loyalty to Jesus Christ, the claims of pious character, and the demands of the salvation of the world.
</p>
<p>
Men must pray, and put strength and heart into their praying. This is part of the primary business of life, and to
it God has called men, first of all.
</p>
<p>
Praying men are God's agents on earth, the representative of government of heaven, set to a specific task on
the earth. While it is true that the Holy Spirit, the angels of God, are agents of God in carrying forward the
redemption of the human race, yet among them there must be praying men. For such men God has great use.
</p>
<p>
He can make much of them, and in the past has done wonderful things through them. These are His
instruments in carrying out God's great purposes on the earth. They are God's messengers, His watchmen,
shepherds, workmen, who need not be ashamed. Fully equipped for the great work to which they are
appointed, they honour God and bless the world. Above all things beside, Christian men and women must,
primarily, be leaders in prayer. No matter how conspicuous they may be in other activities, they fail if they are
not conspicuous in prayer. They must give their brain and heart to prayer. Men who make and shape the
program of Christ's Church, who map out its line of activity, should, themselves, be shaped and made by
prayer. Men controlling the Church finances, her thought, her action - should all be men of prayer.
</p>
<p>
The progress to consummation of God's work in this world has two basic principles - God's ability to give
and man's ability to ask. Failure in either one is fatal to the success of God's work on earth. God's inability to do
or to give would put an end to redemption. Man's failure to pray would, just as surely, set a limit to the plan.
</p>
<p>
But God's ability to do and to give has never failed and cannot fail; but man's ability to ask can fail, and often
does. Therefore the slow progress which is being made toward the realization of a world won for Christ lies
entirely with man's limited asking. There is need for the entire Church of God, on the earth, to betake itself to
prayer. The Church upon its knees would bring heaven upon the earth. The wonderful ability of God to do for
us is thus expressed by Paul in one of his most comprehensive statements, "And God is able to make all grace
abound toward you," he says, "that ye, always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good
work." Study, I pray you, that remarkable statement - "God is able to make all grace abound." That is, He is
able to give such sufficiency, that we may abound - overflow - to every good work. Why are we not more
fully fashioned after this overflowing order? The answer is - lack of prayer-ability.
</p>
<p>
"We have not because we ask not." We are feeble, weak and impoverished, because of our failure to pray.
</p>
<p>
God is restrained in doing because we are restrained by reason of our non-praying. All failures in securing
heaven are traceable to lack of prayer or misdirected petition. Prayer must be broad in its scope - it must plead
for others. Intercession for others is the hall-mark of all true prayer. When prayer is confined to self and to
the sphere of one's personal needs, it dies by reason of its littleness, narrowness and selfishness. Prayer must
be broad and unselfish or it will perish. Prayer is the soul of a man stirred to plead with God for men. In
addition to being interested in the eternal interests of one's own soul it must in its very nature, be concerned
for the spiritual and eternal welfare of others. One's ability to pray for self, finds its climax in the compassion
its concern expresses for others.
</p>
<p>
In 1 Timothy 2, the Apostle Paul urges with singular and specific emphasis, that those who occupy positions
of influence and places of authority, are to give themselves to prayer. "I will, therefore, that the men pray
everywhere." This is the high calling of the men of the Church, and no calling is so engaging, so engrossing
and so valuable that we can afford to relieve Christian men from the all-important vocation of secret prayer.
</p>
<p>
Nothing whatever can take the place of prayer. Nothing whatever can atone for the neglect of praying. This is
uppermost, first in point of importance and first in point of time. No man is so high in position, or in grace, to
be exempt from an obligation to pray. No man is too big to pray, no matter who he is , nor what office he fills.
</p>
<p>
The king on his throne is as much obligated to pray as the peasant in his cottage. None is so high and exalted
in this world or so lowly and obscure as to be excused from praying. The help of every one is needed in
prosecuting the work of God, and the prayer of each praying man helps to swell the aggregate. The leaders in
place, in gifts and in authority are to be chiefs in prayer. Civil and Church rulers shape the affairs of this
world. And so civil and Church rulers themselves need to be shaped personally in spirit, heart and conduct, in
truth and righteousness, by the prayers of God's people. This is in direct line with Paul's words: " I exhort
therefore," he says, " that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for
all men for rulers and all that are in authority." It is a sad day for righteousness when church politics instead of
holy praying, shapes the administration of the Kingdom and elevates men to place and power. Why pray for
all men? Because God wills the salvation of all men. God's children on earth must link their prayers to God's
will. Prayer is to carry out the will of God. God wills the salvation of all men. His heart is set on this one
thing. Our prayers must be the creation and exponent of God's will. We are to grasp humanity in our praying
as God grasps humanity in His love, His interest and His plans to redeem humanity. Our sympathies, prayers,
wrestling and ardent desires must run parallel with the will of God, broad, generous, world-wide and Godlike.
</p>
<p>
The Christian man must in all things, first of all, be conformed to the will of God, but nowhere shall this royal
devotion be more evident than in the salvation of the race of men. This high partnership with God, as its
vicegerents on earth, is to have its fullest, richest, and most efficient exercise in prayer for all men.
</p>
<p>
Men are to pray for all men, are to pray especially for rulers in Church and state, " that we may lead a quiet
and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." Peace on the outside and peace on the inside. Praying calms
disturbing, forces, allays tormenting fears, brings conflict to an end. Prayer tends to do away with turmoil. But
even if there be external conflicts, it is well to have deep peace within the citadel of the soul. "That we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life." Prayer brings the inner calm and furnishes the outward tranquillity. Praying
rulers and praying subjects were they worldwide would allay turbulent forces, make wars to cease, and peace
to reign. Men must pray for all men that we may lead lives " in all godliness and honesty." That is with
godliness and gravity. Godliness is to be like God. It is to be godly, to have God-likeness, having the image of
God stamped upon the inner nature, and showing the same likeness in conduct and in temper. Almighty God
is the very highest model, and to be like Him is to possess the highest character. Prayer moulds us into the
image of God;' and at the same time tends to mould others into the same image just in proportion as we pray
for others. Prayer means to be God-like, and to be God-like is to love Christ and love God, to be one with the
Father and the Son in spirit, character and conduct. Prayer means to stay with God till, you are like Him.
</p>
<p>
Prayer makes a godly man, and puts within him "the mind of Christ," the mind of humility, of self-surrender,
of service, of pity, and of prayer. If we really pray, we will become more like God, or else we will quit
praying. "Men are to pray everywhere," in the closet, in the prayer-meeting, about the family altar, and to do
it, "lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting." Here is not only the obligation laid upon the men to
pray, but instructions as to how they should pray. "Men must pray without wrath." That is without bitterness
against their neighbours or brethren; without the obstinacy and pertinacity of a strong will, and hard feelings,
without an evil desire or emotion kindled by nature's fires in the carnal nature. Praying is not to be done by
these questionable things, nor in company with such evil feelings, but "without " them, aloof and entirely
separate from them. This is the sort of praying the men are called upon to do, the sort which God hears and the
kind which prevails with God and accomplishes things. Such praying in the hands of Christian men become
divine agencies in God's hands for carrying on God's gracious purposes and executing His designs in
redemption. Prayer has a higher origin than man's nature. This is true whether man's nature as separate from
the angelic nature, or man's carnal nature unrenewed and unchanged be meant. Prayer does not originate in the
realms of the carnal mind. Such a nature is entirely foreign to prayer simply because "the carnal mind is
enmity against God." It is by the new Spirit that we pray, the new spirit sweetened by the sugar of heaven
perfumed with the fragrance of the upper world, and invigorated by a breath from the crystal sea. The "new
spirit " is native to the skies, panting after the heavenly things, inspired by the breath of God. It is the praying
temper from which all the old juices of the carnal, unregenerate nature have been expelled, and the fire of God
has created the flame which has consumed worldly lusts, and the juices of the Spirit have been injected into
the soul, and the praying is entirely divorced from wrath.
</p>
<p>
Men are also to pray " without doubting." The Revised Version puts it, "without disputings." Faith in God,
belief in God's Word, they must have "without question." No doubting or disputing must be in the mind.
</p>
<p>
There must be no opinions, nor hesitancy, no questioning, no reasoning, no intellectual quibbling, no
rebellion, but a strict, steadfast loyalty of spirit to God, a life of loyalty in heart and intellect to God's Word.
</p>
<p>
God has much to do with believing men, who have a living, transforming faith in Jesus Christ. These are
God's children. A father loves his children, supplies their needs, hears their cries and answers their requests. A
child believes his father, loves him, trusts in him, and asks him for what he needs, believing without doubting
that his father will hear his requests. God has everything to do with answering the prayer of His children.
</p>
<p>
Their troubles concern Him, and their prayers awaken Him. Their voice is sweet to Him. He loves to hear
them pray, and He is never happier than to answer their prayers. Prayer is intended for God's ear. It is not
man, but God who hears and answers prayer. Prayer covers the whole range of man's need. Hence, in
everything, by prayer and supplication, "are requests to be made known unto God." Prayer includes the entire
range of God's ability. "Is anything too hard for God?" Prayer belongs to no favoured segment of man's need,
but reaches to and embraces the entire circle of his wants, simply because God is the God of the whole man.
</p>
<p>
God has pledged Himself to supply the needs of the whole man, physical, intellectual and spiritual. "But my
God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus." Prayer is the child of grace,
and grace is for the whole man, and for every one of the children of men.

<h1 class="caption">VI. PRAYING MEN AT A PREMIUM</h1>
       <blockquote>"Our Redeemer was in the Garden of Gethsemane. His hour was come. He felt as if He
       would be strengthened somewhat, if He had two or three disciples near Him. His three
       chosen disciples were within a stone's cast of the scene of His agony; but they were all
       asleep that the Scripture might be fulfilled - 'I have trodden the winepress alone, and of
       the people there was none with Me.' The eight, in the distance, were good and true
       disciples; but they were only ordinary men, or men with a commonplace call."
       <div class="sig">-- Alexander Whyte</div></blockquote>
<p>
NO insistence in the Bible is more pressing than the injunction it lays upon men to pray. No exhortation
contained therein is more hearty, more solemn, and more stirring. No principle is more strongly inculcated
than that "men ought always to pray and not to faint." In view of this enjoinder it is pertinent to inquire as to
whether Christian people are praying men and women in anything like body and bulk? Is prayer a fixed course
in the schools of the Church? In the Sunday school, the home, the colleges, have we any graduates in the
school of prayer? Is the Church producing those who have diplomas from the great university of prayer? This
is what God requires, what He commands, and it is those who possess such qualifications that He must have to
accomplish His purposes and to carry out the work of His Kingdom on earth.
</p>
<p>
And it is earnest praying that had need to be done. Languid praying, without heart or strength, with neither
fire nor tenacity, defeats its own avowed purpose. The prophet of olden times laments that in a day which
needed strenuous praying there was no one who "stirred up himself to take hold of God." Christ charges us
"not to faint" in our praying. Laxity and indifference are great hindrances to prayer, both to the practice of
praying and the process of receiving; it requires a brave, strong, fearless and insistent spirit to engage in
successful prayer. Diffuseness, too, interferes with effectiveness. Too many petitions break tension and unity,
and breed neglect. Prayers should be specific and urgent. Too many words, like too much width, breeds
shallows and sand-bars. A single objective which absorbs the whole being and' inflames the entire man, is the
properly constraining force in prayer. It is easy to see how prayer was a decreed factor in the dispensations
preceding the coming of Jesus, and how that their leaders had to be men of prayer; how that God's mightiest
revelation of Himself was a revelation made through prayer. And, finally, how that Jesus Christ, in His
personal ministry, and in His relation to God, was great and constant in prayer. His labours and dispensation
overflowed with fullness in proportion to His prayers. The possibilities of His praying were unlimited and the
possibilities of His ministry were in keeping. The necessity of His praying was equalled only by the constancy
with which He practiced it during His earthly life.
</p>
<p>
The dispensation of the Holy Spirit is a dispensation of prayer, in a preeminent sense. Here prayer has an
essential and vital relation. Without depreciating the possibilities and necessities of prayer in all the
preceding dispensations of God in the world it must be declared that it is in this latter dispensation that the
engagements and demands of prayer are given their greatest authority, their possibilities rendered unlimited
and their necessity insuperable. These days of ours have sore need of a generation of praying men, a band of
men and women through whom God can bring His great and His greatest movements more fully into the
world. The Lord our God is not straitened within Himself, but He is straitened in us, by reason of our little
faith and weak praying. A breed of Christian is greatly needed who will seek tirelessly after God, - who will
give Him no rest, day and night, until He hearken to their cry. The times demand praying men who are all
athirst for God's glory, who are broad and unselfish in their desires, quenchless for God, who seek Him late
and early, and who will give themselves no rest until the whole earth be filled with His glory.
</p>
<p>
Men and women are needed whose prayers will give to the world the utmost power of God; who will make
His promises to blossom with rich and full results. God is waiting to hear us and challenges us to bring Him
to do this thing by our praying. He is asking us, to-day, as He did His ancient Israel, to prove Him now
herewith." Behind God's Word is God Himself, and we read: "Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his
Maker: Ask of me of things to come and concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands,
command ye me." As though God places Himself in the hands and at the disposal of His people who pray - as
indeed He does. The dominant element of all praying is faith, that is conspicuous, cardinal and emphatic.
</p>
<p>
Without such faith it is impossible to please God, and equally impossible to pray.
</p>
<p>
There is a current conception of spiritual duties which tends to separate the pulpit and the pew, as though the
pulpit bore the entire burden of spiritual concerns, and while the pew was concerned only with duties that
relate to the lower sphere of the secular and worldly. Such a view needs drastic correction. God's cause, its
obligations, efforts and successes, lie with equal pressure on pulpit and pew. But the man in the pew is not
taxed with the burden of prayer as he ought to be, and as he must be, ere any new visitation of power come to
the Church. The Church never will be wholly for God until the pews are filled with praying men. The Church
cannot be what God wants it to be until those of its members who are leaders in business, politics, law, and
society, are leaders in prayer. God began His early movements in the world with men of prayer. He chose such
a man to be the father of that race who became His chosen people in the world for hundreds of years, to whom
He committed His oracles, and from whom sprang the Promised Messiah. Abraham, a leader of God's cause,
was preeminently a praying man. When we consider his conduct and character, we readily see how prayer
ruled and swayed this great leader of God's people in the wilderness. "Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba,
and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God," and it is an outstanding fact that wherever he
pitched his tent and camped for a season, with his household, there he erected the altar of sacrifice and of
prayer. His was a personal and a family religion, in which prayer was a prominent and abiding factor.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is the medium of divine revelation. It is through prayer that God reveals Himself to the spiritual soul
to-day, just as in the Old Testament days He made His revelations to the men who prayed. God shows
Himself to the man who prays. "God is with thee in all that though doest." This was the clear conviction of
those who would fain make a covenant with Abraham, and the reason for this tribute was the belief commonly
held concerning the patriarch that, not only was he a man of prayer, but a man whose prayers God would
answer. This is the summary and secret of divine rule in the Church. In all ages God has ruled the Church by
prayerful men. When prayer fails, the divine rulership fails.
</p>
<p>
As we have seen Abraham, the father of the faithful, was a prince and a priest in prayer. He had remarkable
influence with God. God stays His vengeance while Abraham prays. His mercy is suspended and conditioned
on Abraham's praying. His visitations of wrath are removed by the praying of this ruler in Israel. The
movements of God are influenced by the prayers of Abraham, the friend of God. Abraham's righteous
prayerfulness permits him to share the secrets of God's counsels, while the knowledge of these secrets draws
out and intensifies his praying. With Abraham, the altar of sacrifice is hard by the altar of prayer. With him the
altar of prayer sanctifies the altar of sacrifice. To Abimelech God said, " Abraham is a prophet, and he shall
pray for thee, and thou shalt live."
</p>
<p>
Christian people must pray for men. On one occasion, Samuel said unto the people, " Moreover as for me, God
forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you." Fortunate for these sinful people who had
rejected God, and desired a human king, that they had in Israel a man of prayer. The royal way to enlarge
personal grace is to pray for others. Intercessory prayer is a means of grace to those who exercise it. We enter
the richest fields of spiritual growth and gather its priceless riches in the avenues of intercessory prayer. To
pray for men is of divine nomination, and represents the highest form of Christian service. Men must pray,
and men must be prayed for. The Christian must pray for all things, of course, but prayers for men are
infinitely more important, just as men are infinitely more important than things. So also prayers for men are far
more important than prayers for things because men more deeply concern God's will and the work of Jesus
Christ than things. Men are to be cared for, sympathized with and prayed for, because sympathy, pity,
compassion and care accompany and precede prayer for men, when they are not called out for things. All this
makes praying a real business, not child's play, not a secondary affair, nor a trivial matter but a serious
business. The men who have made a success of praying have made a business of praying. It is a process
demanding the time, thought, energy and hearts of mankind. Prayer is business for time, business for eternity.
</p>
<p>
It is a man's business to pray, transcending all other business and taking precedence over all other vocations,
professions or occupations. Our praying concerns ourselves, all men, their greatest interests, even the
salvation of their immortal souls. Praying is a business which takes hold of eternity and the things beyond the
grave. It is a business which involves earth and heaven. All worlds are touched and worlds are influenced by
prayer. It has to do with God and men, angels and devils.
</p>
<p>
Jesus was preeminently a leader in prayer, and His praying is an incentive to prayer. How prominently prayer
stands out in His life. The leading events of His earthly career are distinctly marked by prayer. The wonderful
experience and glory of the Transfiguration was preceded by prayer, and was the result of the praying of our
Lord. What words He used as He prayed we know not, nor do we know for what He prayed. But doubtless it
was night, and long into its hours the Master prayed. It was while He prayed the darkness fled, and His form
was lit with unearthly splendour. Moses and Elijah came to yield to Him not only the palm of law and
prophecy, but the palm of praying. None other prayed as did Jesus nor had any such a glorious manifestation
of the divine presence or heard so clearly the revealing voice of the Father, "This is my beloved Son; hear ye
him." Happy disciples to be with Christ in the school of prayer. How many of us have failed to come to this
glorious Mount of Transfiguration because we were unacquainted with the transfiguring power of prayer. It is
the going apart to pray, the long, intense seasons of prayer, in which we engage which makes the face to
shine, transfigures the character, makes even dull, earthly garments to glisten with heavenly splendour. But
more than this: it is real praying which makes eternal things real, close and tangible, and which brings the
glorified visitors and the heavenly visions. Transfigured lives would not be so rare if there were more of this
transfigured praying. These heavenly visits would not be so few if there was more of this transfigured
praying.
</p>
<p>
How difficult it appears to be for the Church to understand that the whole scheme of redemption depends
upon men of prayers The work of our Lord, while here on the earth, as well of the Apostle Paul was, by
teaching and example, to develop men of prayer, to whom the future of the Church should be committed. How
strange that instead of learning this simple and all important lesson, the modern Church has largely
overlooked it. We have need to turn afresh to that wondrous Leader of spiritual Israel, our Lord Jesus Christ,
who by example and precept enjoins us to prayer and to the great Apostle to the Gentiles, who by virtue of his
praying habits and prayer lessons is a model and an example to God's people in every age and clime.
</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h1 class="caption">VII. THE MINISTRY AND PRAYER</h1>
<blockquote>        "Of course the preacher is above all others distinguished as a. Man of prayer. He prays as
        an ordinary Cliristian, else he were a hypocrite. He prays more than ordinary Christians
        else he were disqualified for the office he has undertaken. If you as ministers are not very
        prayerful you are to be pitied. If you become lax in sacred devotion, not only will you
       need to be pitied but your people also, and the day cometh in which you will be ashamed
       and confounded. Our seasons of fastings and prayer at the Tabernacle have been high
       days indeed; never has heaven's gate stood wider; never have our hearts been nearer the
       central glory."
      <div class="sig">-- Charles Haddon Spurgeon</div></blockquote>
<p>
PREACHERS are God's leaders. They are divinely called to their holy office and high purpose and, primarily,
are responsible for the condition of the Church. just as Moses was called of God to lead Israel out of Egypt
through the wilderness into the Promised Land, so, also, does God call His ministers to lead His spiritual
Israel through this world unto the heavenly land. They are divinely commissioned to leadership, and are by
precept and example to teach God's people what God would have them be. Paul's counsel to the young
preacher Timothy is in point: "Let no man despise thy youth," he says, " but be thou an example of the
believers, in word, conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." God's ministers shape the Church's
character, and give tone and direction to its life. The prefacing sentence of the letter to each of the seven
churches in Asia reads, "To the angel of the Church," seeming to indicate that the angel - the minister - was in
the same state of mind and condition of life as the membership and that these "angels " or ministers were
largely responsible for the spiritual condition of things existing in each Church. The "angel" in each case was
the preacher, teacher, or leader. The first Christians knew full well and felt this responsibility. In their
helplessness, consciously felt, they cried out, "And who is sufficient for things?" as the tremendous
responsibility pressed upon their hearts and heads. The only reply to such a question was, "God only." So they
were necessarily compelled to look beyond themselves for help and throw themselves on prayer to secure
God. More and more as they prayed, did they feel their responsibility, and more and more by prayer did they
get God's help. They realized that their sufficiency was of God.
</p>
<p>
Prayer belongs in a very high and important sense to the ministry. It takes vigour and elevation of character to
administer the prayer-office. Praying prophets have frequently been at a premium in the history of God's
people. In every age the demand has been for leaders in Israel who pray. God's watchmen must always and
everywhere be men of prayer. It ought to be no surprise for ministers to be often found on their knees seeking
divine help under the responsibility of their call. These are the true prophets of the Lord, and these are they
who stand as mouthpieces of God to a generation of wicked and worldly-minded men and women. Praying
preachers are boldest, the truest and the' swiftest ministers of God. They mount up highest and are nearest to
Him who has called them. They advance more rapidly and in Christian living are most like God. In reading
the record of the four evangelists, we cannot but be impressed by the supreme effort made by our Lord to
rightly instruct the twelve Apostles in the things which would properly qualify them for the tremendous tasks
which would be theirs after He had gone back to the bosom of the Father. His solicitude was for the Church
that she should have men, holy in life and in heart, and who would know full well from whence came their
strength and power in the work of the ministry. A large part of Christ's teaching was addressed to these
chosen Apostles, and the training of the twelve occupied much of His thought and consumed much of His
time. In all that training, prayer was laid down as a basic principle.
</p>
<p>
We find the same thing to be true in the life and work of the Apostle Paul. While he addressed himself to the
edification of the churches to whom he ministered and wrote, it was in his mind and purpose to rightly
instruct and prepare ministers to whom would be committed the interests of God's people. The two epistles to
Timothy were addressed to a young preacher, while that to Titus was also written to a young minister. And
Paul's design appears to have been to give to each of them such instruction as would be needed rightly to do
the work of the ministry to which they had been called by the Spirit of God. Underlying these instructions was
the foundation-stone of prayer, since by no means would they be able to " show themselves approved unto
God, workmen that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth," unless they were men of
prayer. The highest welfare of the Church of God on earth depends largely upon the ministry, and so
Almighty God has always been jealous of His watchmen - His preachers. His concern has been for the
character of the men who minister at His altars in holy things. They must be men who lean upon Him, who
look to Him, and who continually seek Him for wisdom, help and power effectively to do the work of the
ministry. And so He has designed men of prayer for the holy office, and has relied upon them successively to
perform the tasks He has assigned them.
</p>
<p>
God's great works are to be done as Christ did them; are to be done, indeed, with increased power received
from the ascended and exalted Christ. These works are to be done by prayer. Men must do God's work in
God's way, and to God's glory, and prayer is a necessity to its successful accomplishment. The thing far above
all other things in the equipment of the preacher is prayer. Before everything else, he must be a man who
makes a specially of prayer. A prayerless preacher is a misnomer. He has either missed his calling, or has
grievously failed God who called him into the ministry. God wants men who are not ignoramuses, who "study
to show themselves approved." Preaching the Word is essential; social qualities are not to be underestimated,
and education is good; but under and above all else, prayer must be the main plank in the platform of the man
who goes forth to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to a lost and hungry world. The one weak spot in
our Church institutions lies just here. Prayer is not regarded as being the primary factor in church life and
activity, and other things, good in their places, are made primary. First things need to be put first, and the first
thing in the equipment of a minister is prayer.
</p>
<p>
Our Lord is the pattern for all preachers, and, with Him, prayer was the law of life. By it He lived. It was the
inspiration of His toil, the source of His strength, the spring of His joy. With our Lord prayer was no
sentimental episode, nor an afterthought, nor a pleasing, diverting prelude, nor an interlude, nor a parade or
form. For Jesus, prayer was exacting, all-absorbing, paramount. It was the call of a sweet duty to Him, the
satisfying of a restless yearning, the preparation for heavy responsibilities, and the meeting of a vigorous
need. This being so, the disciple must be as his Lord, the servant as his Master. As was the Lord Himself, so
also must be those whom He has called to be His disciples. Our Lord Jesus Christ chose His twelve Apostles
only after He had spent a night in praying; and we may rest assured that He sets the same high value on those
He calls to His ministry, in this our own day and time. No feeble or secondary place was given to prayer in the
ministry of Jesus. It comes first-emphatic, conspicuous, controlling. Of prayerful habits, of a prayerful spirit,
given to long solitary communion with God, Jesus was above all else, a man of prayer. The crux of His
earthly history, in New Testament terminology, is condensed to a single statement, to be found in Hebrews 5:
7: Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears,
unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared."
</p>
<p>
As was their Lord and Master, whose they are and whom they serve, so let His ministers be. Let Him be their
pattern, their example, their leader and teacher. Much reference is made in some quarters about "following
Christ," but it is confined to the following of Him in modes and ordinances, as if salvation were wrapped up in
the specific way of doing a thing. "The path of prayer Thyself hath trod," is the path along which we are to
follow Him, and in no other. Jesus was given as a leader to the people of God, and no leader ever exemplified
more the worth and necessity of prayer. Equal in glory with the Father, anointed and sent on His special
mission by the Holy Spirit, His incarnate birth, His high commission, His royal anointing, -all these were His
but they did not relieve Him from the exacting claims of prayer. Rather did they tend to impose these claims
upon Him with greater authority. He did not ask to be excused from the burden of prayer; He gladly accepted
it, acknowledged its claims and voluntarily subjected Himself to its demands. His leadership was preeminent,
and His praying was preeminent. Had it not been, His leadership had been neither preeminent nor divine. If,
in true leadership, prayer had been dispensable, then certainly Jesus could have dispensed with it. But He did
not, nor can any of His followers who desire effectiveness in Christian activity do other than follow their Lord.
</p>
<p>
While Jesus Christ practiced praying Himself, being personally under the law of prayer, and while His
parables and miracles were but exponents of prayer, He laboured directly to teach His disciples the specific art
of praying. He said little or nothing about how to preach or what to preach. But, He spent His strength and
time in teaching men how to speak to God, how to commune with Him, and how to be with Him. He knew full
well that he who has learned the craft of talking to God, will be well versed in talking to men. We may turn
aside for a moment to observe that this was the secret of the wonderful success of the early Methodist
preachers, who were far from being learned men. But with all their limitations, they were men of prayer, and
they did great things for God.
</p>
<p>
All ability to talk to men is measured by the ability with which a preacher can talk to God for men. He "who
ploughs not in his closet, will never reap in his pulpit." The fact must ever be kept in the forefront and
emphasized that Jesus Christ trained His disciples to pray. This is the real meaning of that saying, The
Training of the Twelve." It must be kept in hind that Christ taught the world's preachers more about praying
than He did about preaching. Prayer was the great factor in the spreading of His Gospel. Prayer conserved and
made efficient all other factors. Yet He did not discount preaching when He stressed praying, but rather taught
the utter dependence of preaching on prayer. "The Christian's trade is praying," declared Martin Luther. Every
Jewish boy had to learn a trade. Jesus Christ learned two, the trade of a carpenter, and that of praying. The one
trade subserved earthly uses; the other served His divine and higher purposes. Jewish custom committed Jesus
when a boy to the trade of a carpenter; the law of God bound Him to praying from His earliest years, and
remained with Him to the end. Christ is the Christian's example, and every Christian must pattern after Him.
</p>
<p>
Every preacher must be like his Lord and Master, and must learn the trade of praying. He who learns well the
trade of praying masters the secret of the Christian art, and becomes a skilled workman in God's workshop,
one who needeth not to be ashamed, a worker together with his Lord and Master.
</p>
<p>
"Pray without ceasing," is the trumpet call to the preachers of our time. If the preachers will get their thoughts
clothed with the atmosphere of prayer, if they will prepare their sermons on their knees, a gracious outpouring
of God's Spirit will come upon the earth. The one indispensable qualification for preaching is the gift of the
Holy Spirit, and it was for the bestowal of this indispensable gift that the disciples were charged to tarry in
Jerusalem. The absolute necessity there is for receiving this gift if success is to attend the efforts of the
ministry, is found in the command the first disciples had to stay in Jerusalem till they received it, and also
with the instant and earnest prayerfulness with which they sought it. In obedience to their Lord's command to
tarry in that city till they were endued with power from on high, they immediately, after He left them for
heaven, entered on securing it by continued and earnest prayer. " These all with one accord. continued
steadfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren." To this same
thing John refers in his First Epistle. "Ye have an unction from the Holy One," he says. It is this divine
unction that preachers of the present day should sincerely desire, pray for, remaining unsatisfied till the
blessed gift be richly bestowed.
</p>
<p>
Another allusion to this same important procedure is made by our Lord shortly after His resurrection, when
He said to His disciples: "And ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you." At the
same time Jesus directed the attention of His disciples to the statement of John the Baptist concerning the
Spirit, the identical thing for which He had commanded them to tarry in the city of Jerusalem - " power from
on high." Alluding to John the Baptist's words Jesus said, "For John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall
be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." Peter at a later date said of our Lord: "God anointed
him with the Holy Ghost and with power" These are the divine statements of the mission and ministry of the
Holy Spirit to preachers of that day and the same divine statements apply with equal force to the preachers of
this day. God's ideal minister is a God-called, divinely anointed, Spirit-touched man, separated unto God's
work, set apart from secularities and questionable affairs, baptized from above, marked, sealed and owned by
the Spirit, devoted to his Master and His ministry. These are the divinely-appointed requisites for a preacher of
the Word; without them, he is inadequate, and inevitably unfruitful.
</p>
<p>
To-day, there is no dearth of preachers who deliver eloquent sermons on the need and nature of revival, and
advance elaborate plans for the spread of the kingdom of God, but the praying preachers are far more rare and
the greatest benefactor this age can have is a man who will bring the preachers, the Church and the people back
to the practice of real praying. The reformer needed just now is the praying reformer. The leader Israel
requires is one who, with clarion voice, will call the ministry back to their knees. There is considerable talk of
the coming revival in the air, but we need to have the vision to see that the revival we need and the only one
that can be worth having is one that is born of the Holy Spirit, which brings deep conviction for sin, and
regeneration for those who seek God's face. Such a revival comes at the end of a season of real praying, and it
is utter folly to talk about or expect a revival without the Holy Spirit operating in His peculiar office,
conditioned on much earnest praying. Such a revival will begin in pulpit and pew alike, will be promoted by
both preacher and layman working in harmony with God.
</p>
<p>
The heart is the lexicon of prayer; the life the best commentary on prayer, and the outward bearing its fullest
expression. The character is made by prayer; the life is perfected by prayer. And this the ministry needs to
learn as thoroughly as the laymen. There is but one rule for both. So averse was the general body of Christ's
disciples to prayer, having so little taste for it, and having so little sympathy with Him in the deep things of
prayer, and its mightier struggles, that the Master had to select a circle of three more apt scholars - Peter,
James and John - who had more of sympathy, and relish for this divine work, and take them aside that they
might learn the lesson of prayer. These men were nearer to Jesus, fuller of sympathy, and more helpful to Him
because they were more prayerful. Blessed, indeed, are those disciples whom Jesus Christ, in this day, calls
into a more intimate fellowship with Him, and who, readily responding to the call, are found much on their
knees before Him. Distressing, indeed, is the condition of those servants of Jesus who, in their hearts, are
averse to the exercise of the ministry of prayer. All the great eras of our Lord, historical and spiritual, were
made or fashioned by His praying. In like manner His plans and great achievements were born in prayer and
impregnated by the spirit thereof. As was the Master, so also must His servant be; as his Lord did in the great
eras of His life, so should the disciple do when faced by important crises. "To your knees, O Israel I "should
be the clarion-call to the ministry of this generation.
</p>
<p>
The highest form of religious life is attained by prayer. The richest revelations of God - Father, Son, and
Spirit - are made, not to the learned, the great or the "noble" of earth, but men of prayer. "For ye see your
calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called," to
whom God makes known the deep things of God, and reveals the higher things of His character, but to the
lowly, inquiring, praying ones. And again must it be said, this is as true of preachers as of laymen. It is the
spiritual man who prays, and to praying ones God makes His revelations through the Holy Spirit. Praying
preachers have always brought the greater glory to God, have moved His Gospel onward with its greatest,
speediest rate and power. A non-praying preacher and a non-praying Church may flourish outwardly and
advance in many aspects of their life. Both preacher and church may become synonyms for success, but
unless it rest on a praying basis all success will eventually crumble into deadened life and ultimate decay. "Ye
have not because ye ask not," is the solution of all spiritual weakness both in the personal life and in the pulpit.
</p>
<p>
Either that or it is, "Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss." Real praying lies at the foundation of all
real success of the ministry in the things of God. The stability, energy and facility with which God's kingdom
is established in this world are dependent upon prayer. God has made it so, and so God is anxious for men to
pray. Especially is He concerned that His chosen ministers shall be men of prayer, and so gives that wonderful
statement in order to encourage His ministers to pray, which is found in Matthew 6: 9: "But I say unto you,
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one
that asketh, receiveth, and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened."
</p>
<p>
Thus both command and direct promise give accent to His concern that they shall pray. Pause and think on
these familiar words. "Ask, and it shall be given you." That itself would seem to be enough to set us all,
laymen and preachers, to praying, so direct, simple and unlimited. These words open all the treasures of
heaven to us, simply by asking for them. If we have not studied the prayers of Paul, primarily a preacher to
the Gentiles, we can have but a feeble view of the great necessity for prayer, and how much it is worth in the
life and the work of a minister of the Gospel. Furthermore, we shall have but a very limited view of the
possibilities of the Gospel to enrich and make strong and perfect Christian character, as well as to equip
preachers for their high and holy task. Oh, when will we learn the simple yet all important lesson that the one
great thing needed in the life of a preacher to help him in his personal life, to keep his soul alive to God, and
to give efficacy to the Word preached by him is real, constant prayer. Paul with prayer uppermost in his mind,
assures the Colossians that "Epaphras is always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand
complete and perfect in all the will of God." To this high state of grace, "complete in all the will of God," he
prays they may come. So prayer was the force which was to bring them to that elevated, vigorous and stable
state of heart. This is in line with Paul's teaching to the Ephesians, "And he gave some pastors and teachers,
for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ," where it is
evidently affirmed that the whole work of the ministry is not merely to induce sinners to repent, but it is also
the "perfecting of the saints." And so Epaphras "laboured fervently in prayers" for this thing. Certainly he was
himself a praying man, in thus so earnestly praying for these early Christians.
</p>
<p>
The Apostles put out their force in order that Christians should honour God by the purity and consistency of
their outward lives. They were to reproduce the character of Jesus Christ. They were to perfect His image in
themselves, imbibe His temper and reflect His carriage in all their tempers and conduct. They were to be
imitators of God as dear children, to be holy as He was holy. Thus even laymen were to preach by their
conduct and character, just as the ministry preached with their mouths. To elevate the followers of Christ to
these exalted heights of Christian experience, they were in every way true in the ministry of God's Word, in
the ministry of prayer, in holy consuming zeal, in burning exhortation, in rebuke and reproof. Added to all
these, sanctifying all these, invigorating all these, and making all of them salutary, they centered and exercised
constantly the force of mightiest praying. "Night and day praying exceedingly," that is, praying out of
measure, with intense earnestness, superabundantly, beyond measure, exceeding abundantly. Night and day
praying exceeding abundantly, that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your
faith. Now God himself, and our Fdther, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. "And the Lord
make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you;
to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
</p>
<p>
It was after this fashion that these Apostles - the first preachers in the early Church-laboured in prayer. And
only those who labour after the same fashion are the true successors of these Apostles. This is the true, the
Scriptural "apostolical succession," the succession of simple faith, earnest desire for holiness of heart and life,
and zealous praying. These are the things to-day which make the ministry strong, faithful and efficient,
"workmen who needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." Jesus Christ, God's Leader and
Commander of His people, lived and suffered under this law of prayer. All His personal conquests in His life
on earth were won by obedience to this law, while the conquests which have been won by His representatives
since He ascended to heaven, were gained only when this condition of prayer was heartily and fully met.
</p>
<p>
Christ was under this one prayer condition. His Apostles were under the same prayer condition. His saints are
under it, and even His angels are under it. By every token, therefore, preachers are under the same prayer law.
</p>
<p>
Not for one moment are they relieved or excused from obedience to the law of prayer. It is their very life, the
source of their power, the secret of their religious experience and communion with God. Christ could do
nothing without prayer. Christ could do all things by prayer. The Apostles were helpless without prayer-and
were absolutely dependent upon it for success in defeating their spiritual foes. They could do all things by
prayer.

<h1 class="caption">VIII. PRAYER-EQUIPMENT FOR PREACHERS</h1>
<blockquote>      "Go back! Back to that upper room; back to your knees; back to searching of heart and
      habit, thought and life; back to pleading, praying, waiting, till the Spirit of the Lord
      floods the soul with light, and you are endued with power from on high. Then go forth in
      the power of Pentecost, and the Christ-life shall be lived, and the works of Christ shall be
      done. You shall open blind eyes, cleanse foul hearts, break men's fetters, and save men's
      souls. In the power of the indwelling Spirit, miracles become the commonplace of daily
      living."
     <div class="sig"> -- Samuel Chadwick</div>
</blockquote>
ALMOST the last words uttered by our Lord before His ascension to heaven, were those addressed to the
eleven disciples, words which, really, were spoken to, and having directly to do with, preachers, words which
indicate very clearly the needed fitness which these men must have to preach the Gospel, beginning at
Jerusalem: "But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem," says Jesus, "till ye be endued with power from on high."
</p>
<p>
Two things are very clearly set forth in these urgent directions. First, the power of the Holy Ghost for which
they must tarry. This was to be received after their conversion, an indispensable requisite, equipping them for
the great task set before them. Secondly, the "promise of the Father," this "power from on high," would come
to them after they had waited in earnest, continuous prayer. A reference to Acts 1:14 will reveal that these
same men, with the women, "continued with one accord in prayer and supplication," and so continued until
the Day of Pentecost, when the power from on high descended upon them.
</p>
<p>
This "power from on high," as important to those early preachers as it is to present-day preachers, was not the
force of a mighty intellect, holding in its grasp great truths, flooding them with light, and forming them into
verbal shapeliness and beauty. Nor was it the acquisition of great learning, or the result of an address, faultless
and complete by rule of rhetoric. None of these things. Nor was this spiritual power held then, nor is it held
now, in the keeping of any earthly sources of power. The effect and energy of all human forces are essentially
different in source and character, and do not at all result from this "power from on high." The transmission of
such power is directly from God, a bestowal, in rich measure, of the force and energy which pertains only to
God, and which is transmitted to His messengers only in answer to a longing, wrestling attitude of his soul
before his Master, conscious of his own impotency and seeking the omnipotency of the Lord he serves, in
order more fully to understand the given Word and to preach the same to his fellow-men.
</p>
<p>
The "power from on high" may be found in combination with all sources of human power, but is not to be
confounded with them, is not dependent upon them, and must never be superseded by them. Whatever of
human gift, talent or force a preacher may possess it is not to be made paramount, or even conspicuous. It
must be hidden, lost, overshadowed by this " power from on high." The forces of intellect and culture may all
be present, but without this inward, heaven-given power, all spiritual effort is vain and unsuccessful. Even
when lacking the other equipment but having this "power from on high," a preacher cannot but succeed. It is
the one essential, all-important vital force which a messenger of God must possess to give wings to his
message, to put life into his preaching, and to enable him to speak the Word with acceptance and power.
</p>
<p>
A word is necessary here. Distinctions need to be kept in mind. We must think clearly upon this question.
</p>
<p>
"Power from on high " means "the unction of the Holy One" resting on and abiding in the preacher. This is not
so much a power which bears witness to a man being the child of God as it is a preparation for delivering the
Word to others. Unction must be distinguished from pathos. Pathos may exist in a sermon while unction is
entirely absent. So also, may unction be present and pathos absent. Both may exist together; but they are not
to be confused, nor be made to appear to be the same thing. Pathos promotes emotion, tender feeling,
sometimes tears. Quite often it results from the relation of an affecting incident, or when the tender side is
peculiarly appealed to. But pathos is neither the direct nor indirect result of the Holy Spirit resting upon the
preacher as he preaches. But unction is. Here we are given the evidence of the workings of an undefinable
agency in the preacher, which results directly from the presence of this "power from on high," deep,
conscious, life-giving and carrying, giving power and point to the preached Word. It is the element in a
sermon which arouses, stirs, convicts and moves the souls of sinners and saints. This is what the preacher
requires, the great equipment for which he should wait and pray. This "unction of the Holy One" delivers
from dryness, saves from superficiality, and gives authority to preaching. It is the one quality which
distinguishes the preacher of the Gospel from other men who speak in public; it is that which makes a sermon
unique, unlike the deliverance of any other public speaker.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is the language of a man burdened with a sense of need. It is the voice of the beggar, conscious of his
poverty, asking of another the things he needs. It is not only the language of lack, but of felt lack, of lack
consciously realized. "Blessed are the poor in spirit," means not only that the fact of poverty of spirit brings
the blessing, but also that poverty of spirit is realized, known and acknowledged. Prayer is the language of
those who need something - something which they, themselves, cannot supply but which God has promised
them, and for which they ask. In the end, "poor praying and prayerlessness amount to the same thing, for poor
praying proceeds from a lack of the sense of need, while prayerlessness has its origin in the same soil. Not to
pray is not only to declare there is nothing needed, but to admit to a nonrealization of that need. This is what
aggravates the sin of prayerlessness. It represents an attempt at instituting an independence of God, a
self-sufficient ruling of God out of the life. It is a declaration made to God that we do not need Him, and hence
do not pray to Him.
</p>
<p>
This is the state in which the Holy Spirit, in His messages to the Seven Churches in Asia, found the Laodicean
Church and " the Laodiccan state " has come to stand for one in which God is ruled out, expelled from the life,
put out of the pulpit. The entire condemnation of this Church is summed up in one expression: "Because thou
sayest, I have need of nothing," the most alarming state into which a person, or church or preacher can come.
</p>
<p>
Trusting in its riches, in its social position, in things outward and material, the Church at Laodicea omitted
God, leaving Him out of their church plans and church work, and declared, by their acts and by their omission
of prayer, "I have need of nothing." No wonder the self-satisfied declaration brought forth its sentence of
punishment - " Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth." The
idea conveyed is that such a backslidden state of heart is as repulsive to God as an emetic is to the human
stomach, and as the stomach expels that which is objectionable, so Almighty God threatens to "spue out of
His mouth" these people who were in such a religious condition so repulsive to Him. All of it was traceable to
a prayerless state of heart, for no one can read this word of the Spirit to this Laodicean Church and not see that
the very core of their sin was prayerlessness. How could a Church, given to prayer, openly and vauntingly
declare, "I have need of nothing" in the face of the Spirit's assertion that it needed everything, "Thou knowest
not that thou art wretched, and poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked"? In addition to their sin of
self-sufficiency and of independence of God, the Laodiceans were spiritually blind. Oh, what dullness of
sight, what blindness of soul! These people were prayerless, and knew not the import of such prayerlessness.
</p>
<p>
They lacked everything which goes to make up spiritual life, and force, and self-denying piety, and vainly
supposed themselves to need nothing but material wealth, thus making temporal possessions a substitute for
spiritual wealth, leaving God entirely out of their activities, relying upon human and material resources to do
the work only possible to the divine and supernatural, and secured alone by prayer.
</p>
<p>
Nor let it be forgotten that this letter (in common with the other six letters) was primarily addressed to the
preacher in charge of the church. All this strengthens the impression that the "angel of the church" himself
was in this lukewarm state. He himself was living a prayerless life, relying upon things other than God,
practically saying, "I have need of nothing." For these words are the natural expression of the spirit of him
who does not pray, who does not care for God, and who does not feel the need of Him in his life, in his work
and in his preaching. Furthermore, the words of the Spirit seem to indicate that the "angel of the church" at
Laodicea was indirectly responsible for this sad condition into which the Laodicean Church had fallen. May
not this sort of a church be found in modern times? Is it not likely that we could discover some preachers of
modern times who fall under a similar condemnation to that passed upon the "angel of the church of"
</p>
<p>
Laodicea?
Preachers of the present age excel those of the past in many, possibly in all, human elements of success. They
are well abreast of the age in learning, research, and intellectual vigour. But these things neither insure "power
from on high" nor guarantee a live, thriving religious experience, or righteous life. These purely human gifts
do not bring with them an insight into the deep things of God, or strong faith in the Scriptures, or an intense
loyalty to God's divine revelation. The presence of these earthly talents even in the most commanding and
impressive form, and richest measure do not in the least abate the necessity for the added endowment of the
Holy Spirit. Herein lies the great danger menacing the pulpit of to-day. All around us we see a tendency to
substitute human gifts and worldly attainments for that supernatural, inward power which comes from on high
in answer to earnest prayer. In many instances modern preaching seems to fail in the very thing which should
create and distinguish true preaching, which is essential to its being, and which alone can make of it a divine
and powerfully aggressive agency. It lacks in short, "the power from on high" which alone can make it a living
thing. It fails to become the channel through which God's saving power can be made to appeal to men's
consciences and hearts.
</p>
<p>
Quite often, modern preaching fails at this vital point, for lack of exercising a potent influence which disturbs
men in their sleep of security, and awakens them to a sense of need and of peril. There is a growing need of
an appeal which will quicken and arouse the conscience from its ignoble stupor and give it a sense of
wrong-doing and a corresponding sense of repentance. There is need of a message which searches into the
secret places of man's being, dividing, as it were, the joints and the marrow, and laying bare the mysterious
depths before himself and his God. Much of our present day preaching is lacking in that quality which infuses
new blood into the heart and veins of faith, that arms it with courage and skill for the battle with the powers
of darkness, and secures it a victory over the forces of the world. Such high and noble ends can never be
accomplished by human qualifications, nor can these great results be secured by a pulpit clothed only with the
human elements of power, however gracious, comfortable, and helpful they may be. The Holy Spirit is
needed. He alone can equip the ministry for its difficult and responsible work in and out of the pulpit. Oh, that
the present-day ministry may come to see that its one great need is an enduement of "power from on high," and
that this one need can be secured only by the use of God's appointed means of grace - the ministry of prayer.
</p>
<p>
Prayer is needed by the preacher in order that his personal relations with God may be maintained and that
because there is no difference between him and any other kind of a man in so far as his personal salvation is
concerned. This he must work out "with fear and trembling," just as all other men must do. Thus prayer is of
vast importance to the preacher in order that he may possess a growing religious experience, and be enabled to
live such a life that his character and conduct will back up his preaching and give force to his message. A man
must have prayer in his pulpit work, for no minister can preach effectively without prayer. He also has use for
prayer in praying for others. Paul was a notable example of a preacher who constantly prayed for those to
whom he ministered.
</p>
<p>
But we come, now, to another sphere of prayer, that of the people praying for the preacher. "Brethren, pray for
us." This is the cry which Paul set in motion, and which has been the cry of spiritually minded preachers -
those who know God aid who know that value of prayer - in all succeeding ages. No condition of success or
the reverse of it must abate the cry. No degree of culture, no abundance of talents, must cause that cry to
cease. The learned preacher, as well as the unlearned, has equal need to call out to the people they serve,
"Withal, praying also for us." Such a cry voices the felt need of a preacher's heart who feels the need there is
for sympathies of a people to be in harmony with its minister: It is but the expression of the inner soul of a
preacher who feels his insufficiency for the tremendous responsibilities of the pulpit, who realizes his
weakness and his need of the divine unction, and who throws himself upon the prayers of his congregation,
and calls out to them, "Praying always with all prayer and supplication, in the Spirit, and for me, that utterance
may be given me." It is the cry of deep felt want in the heart of the preacher who feels he must have this
prayer made specifically for him that he may do his work in God's own way.
</p>
<p>
When this request to a people to pray for the preacher is cold, formal and official, it freezes instead of
fructifies. To be ignorant of the necessity for the cry, is to be ignorant of the sources of spiritual success. To
fail to stress the cry, and to fail to have responses to it, is to sap the sources of spiritual life. Preachers must
sound out the cry to the Church of God. Saints everywhere and of every kind, and of every faith speedily
respond and pray for the preacher. The imperative need of the work demands it. "Pray for us," is the natural
cry of the hearts of God's called men - faithful preachers of the Word. Saintly praying in the early Church
helped apostolic preaching mightily, and rescued apostolic men from many dire straits. It can do the same
thing to-day. It can open doors for apostolic labours, and apostolic lips to utter bravely and truly the Gospel
message. Apostolic movements wait their ordering from prayer, and avenues long closed are opened to
apostolic entrance by and through the power of prayer. The messenger receives his message and is schooled
as to how to carry and deliver the message by prayer. The forerunner of the Gospel, and that which prepares
the way, is prayer; not only by the praying of the messenger himself, but by the praying of the Church of God.
</p>
<p>
Writing along this line in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul is first general in his request and says,
"Brethren, pray for us." Then he becomes more minute and particular: "Finally, brethren, pray for us," he goes
on, "that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it is with you. And that we may
be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith." The Revised Version has for
"free course " the word "run." "The Word" means doctrine, and the idea conveyed is that this doctrine of the
Gospel is rapidly propagated, a metaphor taken from the running of a race, and is an exhortation to exert one's
self, to strive hard, to expend strength. Thus the prayer for the spread of the Gospel gives the same energy to
the Word of the Lord, as the greatest outlay of strength gives success to the racer. Prayer in the pew gives the
preached Word energy, facility, and success. Preaching without the backing of mighty praying is as limp and
worthless an effort as can be imagined. Prayerlessness in the pew is a serious hindrance to the running of the
Word of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
The preaching of the Word of the Lord fails to run and be glorified from many causes. The difficulty may lie
with the preacher himself, should his outward conduct be out of harmony with the rule of the Scriptures and
his own profession. The Word lived must be in accord with the Word delivered; the life must be in harmony
with the sermon. The preacher's spirit and behaviour out of the pulpit must run parallel with the Word of the
Lord spoken in the pulpit. Otherwise, a man is an obstacle to the success of his own message. Again, the
Word of the Lord may fail to run, may be seriously encumbered and crippled by the inconsistent lives of those
who are the hearers thereof. Bad living in the pew will seriously cripple the Word of the Lord, as attempts to
run on its appointed course. Unrighteous lives among the laity heavily weights down the Word of the Lord
and hampers the work of the ministry. Yet prayer will remove this burden which seriously handicaps the
preached Word. It will tend to do this in a direct way, or in an indirect manner. For just as you set laymen to
praying, for the preacher or even for themselves, it awakens conscience, stirs the heart , and tends to correct
evil ways and to promote good living. No man will pray long and continue in sin. Praying breaks up bad
living while bad living breaks down prayer. Praying goes into bankruptcy when a man goes to sinning. To
obey the cry of the preacher, "Brethren, pray for us," sets men to doing that which will induce right living in
them, and will tend to break them away from sin. So it comes about that it is worth no little to get the laity to
pray for the ministry. Prayer helps the preacher, is an aid to the sermon, assists the hearer and promotes right
living in the pew.
</p>
<p>
Prayer also moves him who prays for the preacher and for the Word of the Lord, to use all his influence to
remove any hindrance to that Word which he may see, and which lies in his power to remove. But prayer
reaches the preacher directly. God hears the praying of a church for its minister. Prayer for the preached Word
is a direct aid to it. Prayer for the preacher gives wings to the Gospel, as well as feet. Prayer makes the Word
of the Lord go forward strongly and rapidly. It takes the shackles off of the message, and gives it a chance to
run straight to the hearts of sinners and saints, alike. It opens the way, clears the track, furnishes a free
course. The failure of many a preacher may be found just here. He was hampered, hindered, crippled by a
prayerless church. Non-praying officials stood in the way of the Word preached, and became veritable
stumbling blocks in the way of the Word, definitely preventing its reaching the hearts of the unsaved.
</p>
<p>
Unbelief and prayerlessness go together. It is written of our Lord in Matthew's Gospel that when He entered
into His own country, "he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief." Mark puts it a little
differently, but giving out the same idea: "And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folks and healed them. And he marveled because of their unbelief." Unquestionably the
unbelief of that people hindered our Lord in His gracious work and tied His hands. And if that be true, it
requires no undue straining of the Scriptures when we say that the unbelief and prayerlessness of a church can
tie the hands of its preacher, and prevent him from doing many great works in the salvation of souls and in
edifying saints. Prayerlessness, therefore, as it concerns the preacher is a very serious matter. If it exists in the
preacher himself, then he ties his own hands and makes the Word as preached by him ineffective and void. If
prayerless men be found in the pew, then it hurts the preacher, robs him of an invaluable help, and interferes
seriously with the success of his work. How great the need of a praying church to help on the preaching of the
Word of the Lord! Both pew and pulpit are jointly concerned in this preaching business. It is a copartnership.
</p>
<p>
The two go hand in hand. One must help the other, one can hinder the other. Both must work in perfect accord
or serious damage will result, and God's plan concerning the preacher and the preached Word be defeated.
</p>

<h1 class="caption">IX. THE PREACHER'S CRY - "PRAY FOR US"</h1>
<blockquote>       "That the true apostolic preacher must have the prayers of others - good people to give to
       his ministry its full quota of success, Paul is a preeminent example. He asks, he covets,
       he pleads in an impassionate way for the help of all God's saints. He knew that in the
       spiritual realm as elsewhere, in union there is strength; that the consecration and
       aggregation of faith, desire, and prayer increased the volume of spiritual force until it
       became overwhelming and irresistible in its power. Units of prayer combined, like drops
       of water, make an ocean that defies resistance."

      <div class="sig"> -- E. M. B.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
HOW far does praying for the preacher help preaching? It helps him personally and officially. It helps him to
maintain a righteous life, it helps him in preparing his message, and it helps the Word preached by him to run
to its appointed goal, unhindered and unhampered. A praying church creates a spiritual atmosphere most
favourable to preaching. What preacher knowing anything of the real work of preaching doubts the veracity of
this statement? The spirit of prayer in a congregation begets an atmosphere surcharged with the Spirit of the
Highest, removes obstacles and gives the Word of the Lord right of way. The very attitude of such a
congregation constitutes an environment most encouraging and favourable to preaching. It renders preaching
an easy task; it enables the Word to run quickly and without friction, helped on by the warmth of souls
engaged in prayer.
</p>
<p>
Men in the pew given to praying for the preacher, are like the poles which hold up the wires along which the
electric current runs. They are not the power, neither are they the specific agents in making the Word of the
Lord effective. But they hold up the wires, along which the divine power runs to the hearts of men. They give
liberty to the preacher, exemption from being straitened, and keep him from " getting in the brush." They
make conditions favourable for the preaching of the Gospel. Preachers, not a few, who know God, have had
large experience and are aware of the truth of these statements. Yet how hard have they found it to preach in
some places. This was because they had no "door of utterance," and were hampered in their delivery, there
appearing no response whatever to their appeals. On the other hand, at other times, thought flowed easily,
words came freely, and there was no failure in utterance. The preacher "had liberty," as the old men used to
declare. The preaching of the Word to a prayerless congregation falls at the very feet of the preacher. It has no
travelling force; it stops because the atmosphere is cold, unsympathetic, unfavourable to its running to the
hearts of men and women. Nothing is there to help it along. just as some prayers never go above the head of
him who prays, so the preaching of some preachers goes no farther than the front of the pulpit from which it is
delivered. It takes prayer in the pulpit and prayer in the pew to make preaching arresting, life-giving and
soulsaving.
</p>
<p>
The Word of God is inseparably linked with prayer. The two are conjoined, twins from birth, and twins by
life. The Apostles found themselves absorbed by the sacred and pressing duty of distributing the alms of the
Church, till time was not left for them to pray. They directed that other men should be appointed to discharge
this task, that they might be the better able to give themselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the
Word. So it might likewise be said that prayer for the preacher by the church is also inseparably joined to
preaching. A praying church is an invaluable help to the faithful preacher. The Word of the Lord runs in such
a church, "and is glorified" in the saving of sinners, in the reclamation of backsliders, and in the sanctifying
of believers. Paul connects the Word of God closely in prayer in writing to Timothy: For every creature of
God is good," he says, "and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the
Word of God and prayer." And so the Word of the Lord is dependent for its rapid spread and for its full, and
most glorious success in prayer.
</p>
<p>
Paul indicates that prayer transmutes the ills which come to the preacher: " For I know that this shall turn to
my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ." It was "through their prayer"
</p>
<p>
he declares these benefits would come to him. And so it is "through the prayer of a church" that the pastor
will be the beneficiary of large spiritual things. In the latter part of the Epistle to the Hebrews, we have Paul's
request for prayer for himself addressed to the Hebrew Christians, basing his request on the grave and eternal
responsibilities of the office of a preacher: "Obey them that have the rule over you," he says, "and submit
yourselves; for they watch for your souls as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not
with grief; for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience in all things
willing to live honestly." How little does the Church understand the fearful responsibility attaching to the
office and work of the ministry. "For they watch for your souls as they that must give account." God's
appointed watchmen, to warn when danger is nigh; God's messengers sent to rebuke, reprove and exhort with
all long-suffering; ordained as shepherds to protect the sheep against devouring wolves. How responsible is
their position. And they are to give account to God for their work, and are to face a day of reckoning. How
much do such men need the prayers of those to whom they minister. And who should be more ready to do this
praying than God's people, His own Church, those presumably who are in heart sympathy with the minister
and his allimportant work, divine in its origin.
</p>
<p>
Among the last messages of Jesus to His disciples are those found in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth
chapters of John's Gospel. In the fourteenth, as well as in the others, are some very specific teachings about
prayer, designed for their help and encouragement in their future work. We must never lose sight of the fact
that these last discourses of Jesus Christ were given to disciples alone, away from the busy crowds, and seem
primarily intended for them in their public ministry. In reality, they were words spoken to preachers, for these
eleven men were to be the first preachers of the new dispensation. With this thought in mind, we are able to
see the tremendous importance given to prayer by our Lord, and the high place He gave it in the lifework of
preachers, both in this day and in that day. First our Lord proposes that He will pray for these disciples, that
the Father might send them another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world could not receive. He
preceded this statement by a direct command to them to pray, to pray for anything, with the assurance that they
would receive what they asked for. If, therefore, there was value in their own praying, and it was of great
worth that our Lord should intercede for them, then of course it would be worth while that the people to whom
they would minister should also pray for them. It is no wonder then that the Apostle Paul should take the key
from our Lord, and several times break out with the urgent exhortation, " Pray for us."
</p>
<p>
True praying done by the laymen helps in many ways, but in one particular way. It helps very materially the
preacher to be brave and true. Read Paul's request to the Ephesians: Praying always with all prayer and
supplication," he says, "in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all
saints; and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the
mystery of the gospel; for which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak as I ought to speak."
</p>
<p>
How much of the boldness and loyalty of Paul was dependent upon the prayers of the Church, or rather how
much he was helped at these two points, we may not know. But unquestionably there must have come to him
through the prayers of the Christians at Ephesus, Colosse and Thessalonica, much aid in preaching the Word,
of which he would have been deprived had these churches not have prayed for him. And in like manner, in
modern times has the gift of ready and effective utterance in the preacher been bestowed upon a preacher
through the prayers of a praying church. The Apostle Paul did not desire to fall short of that most important
quality in a preacher of the Gospel, namely, boldness. He was no coward, or time-server, or man-pleaser, but
he needed prayer, in order that he might not, through any kind of timidity, fail to declare the whole truth of
God, or through fear of men, declare it in an apologetic, hesitating way. He desired to remove himself as far as
possible from an attitude of this kind. His constant desire and effort was to declare the Gospel with
consecrated boldness and with freedom. "That I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of
the Gospel, that I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak," seemed to be his great desire, and it would appear
that, at times, he was really afraid that he might exhibit cowardice, or be affected by the fear Of the face of
man.
</p>
<p>
This is a day that has urgent need of men after the mould of the great Apostle - men of courage, brave and
true, who are swayed not by the fear of men, or reduced to silence or apology by the dread of consequences.
</p>
<p>
And one way to secure them is for the pew to engage in earnest prayer for the preachers. In Paul's word to the
Ephesian elders given when on his way to Jerusalem, Paul exculpates himself from the charge of
blood-guiltiness, in that he had not failed to declare the whole counsel of God to them. To his Philippian
brethren, also, he says, that through their prayers, he would prove to be neither ashamed nor afraid. Nothing,
perhaps, can be more detrimental to the advancement of the kingdom of God among men than a timid, or
doubtful statement of revealed truth. The man who states only the half of what he believes, stands side by side
with the man who fully declares what he only half believes. No coward can preach the Gospel, and declare
the whole counsel of God. To do that, a man must be in the battle-attitude not from passion, but by reason of
deep conviction, strong conscience and full-orbed courage. Faith is in the custody of a gallant heart while
timidity surrenders, always, to a brave spirit. Paul prayed, and prevailed on others to pray that he might he a
man of resolute courage, brave enough to do everything but sin. The result of this mutual praying is that
history has no finer instance of courage in a minister of Jesus Christ than that displayed in the life of the
Apostle Paul. He stands in the premier position as a fearless, uncompromising, God-fearing preacher of the
Gospel of his Lord.
</p>
<p>
God seems to have taken great pains with His prophets of old time to save them from fear while delivering
His messages to mankind. He sought in every way to safeguard His spokesmen from the fear of man, and by
means of command, reasoning and encouragement sought to render them fearless and true to their high calling.
</p>
<p>
One of the besetting temptations of a preacher is the "fear" of the face of man. Unfortunately, not a few
surrender to this fear, and either remain silent at times when they should be boldly eloquent, or temper with
smooth words the stern mandate it is theirs to deliver. "The fear of man bringeth a snare." With this sore
temptation Satan often besets the preacher of the Word and few there be who have not felt the force of this
temptation. It is the duty of ministers of the Gospel to face this temptation to fear the face of man with
resolute courage and to steel themselves against it, and, if need be, trample it under foot. To this important
end, the preacher should be prayed for by his church. He needs deliverance from fear, and prayer is the
agency whereby it can be driven away and freedom from the bondage of fear given to his soul.
</p>
<p>
We have a striking picture of the preacher's need of prayer, and of what a people's prayers can do for him in
the seventeenth of the Book of Exodus. Israel and Amalek were in battle, and the contest was severe and
close. Moses stood on top of the hill with his rod lifted up in his hands, the symbol of power and victory. As
long as Moses held up the rod, Israel prevailed, but when he let down his hand with the rod, Amalek prevailed.
</p>
<p>
While the contest was in the balance, Aaron and Hur came to the rescue, and when Moses' hands were heavy,
these two men "stayed up his hands, . . . until the going down of the sun. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and
his people." By common consent, this incident in the history of ancient Israel has been recognized as a striking
illustration of how a people may sustain their preacher by prayer, and of how victory comes when the people
pray for their preacher. Some of the Lord's very best men in Old Testament times had to be encouraged
against fear by Almighty God. Moses himself was not free from the fear which harasses and compromises a
leader. God told him to go to Pharaoh, in these words: "Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto
Pharaoh, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." But Moses, largely
through fear, began to offer objections and excuses for not going, until God became angry with him, and said,
finally, that He would send Aaron with Moses to do the talking, as long as Moses insisted that he "was slow
of speech and of slow tongue." But the fact was, Moses was afraid of the face of Pharaoh, and it took God
some time to circumvent his fears and nerve him to face the Egyptian monarch and deliver God's message to
him. And Joshua, too, the successor of Moses, and a man seemingly courageous, must needs be fortified by
God against fear, lest he shrink from duty, and be reduced to discouragement and timidity. " Be strong and of
good courage," God commanded him. " Have I not commanded thee? Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed,
for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest." As good and true a man as Jeremiah was sorely
tempted to fear and had to be warned and strengthened lest he prove false to his charge. When God ordained
him a prophet unto the nations, Jeremiah began to excuse himself on the ground that he could not speak, being
but a child in that regard. So the Lord had to safeguard him from the temptation of fear, that he might not
prove faithless: "Thou therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them," God said to His servant,
"all that I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them."
</p>
<p>
Since these great men of old time were so beset with this temptation, and disposed to shrink from duty we
need not be surprised that preachers of our own day are to be found in similar case. The devil is the same in all
ages; nor has human nature undergone any change. How needful, then, that we pray for the leaders of our
Israel especially that they may receive the gift of boldness, and speak the Word of God with courage. This
was one reason why Paul insisted so vigorously that the brethren pray for him, so that a door of utterance
might be given him, and that he might be delivered from the fear of man, and blessed with holy boldness in
preaching the Word.
</p>
<p>
The challenge and demand of the world in our own day is that Christianity be made practical; that its precepts
be expressed in practice, and brought down from the realm of the ideal to the levels of every-day life. This
can be done only by praying men, who being much in sympathy with their ministers will not cease to bear them
up in their prayers before God. A preacher of the Gospel cannot meet the demands made upon him, alone, any
more than the vine can bear grapes without branches. The men who sit in the pews are to be the fruit-bearing
ones. They are to translate the "ideal" of the pulpit into the "real" of daily life and action. But they will not do
it, they cannot do it, if they be not devoted to God and much given to prayer. Devotion to God and devotion to
prayer are one and the same thing.

<blockquote>      "When the dragon-fly rends his husk and harnesses himself, in a clean plate of sapphire

      dew, yet nothing can exceed the marvelous beauty in which he is decked. No flowers on

      <div class="sig">-- History of David Brainerd</div></blockquote>
<p>
GOD has not confined Himself to Bible days in showing what can be done through prayer. In modern times,
also, He is seen to be the same prayer-hearing God as aforetime. Even in these latter days He has not left
Himself without witness. Religious biography and Church history, alike, furnish us with many noble
examples and striking illustrations of prayer, its necessity, its worth and its fruits, all tending to the
encouragement of the faith of God's saints and all urging them on to more and better praying. God has not
confined Himself to Old and New Testament times in employing praying men as His agents in furthering His
cause on earth, and He has placed Himself under obligation to answer their prayers just as much as He did the
saints of old. A selection from these praying saints of modern times will show us how they valued prayer,
what it meant to them, and what it meant to God.
</p>
<p>
Take for example, the instance of Samuel Rutherford, the Scottish preacher, exiled to the north of Scotland,
forbidden to preach, and banished from his home and pastoral charge. Rutherford lived between 1600 and
1661. He was a member of the Westminster Assembly, Principal of New College, and Rector of St. Andrews'
University. He is said to have been one of the most moving and affectionate preachers of his time, or, perhaps,
in any age of the Church. Men said of him, "He is always praying," and concerning his and his wife's praying,
one wrote: "He who had heard either pray or speak, might have learned to bemoan his ignorance. Oh, how
many times have I been convinced by observing them of the evil of insincerity before God and unsavouriness
in discourse! He so prayed for his people that he himself says, 'There I wrestled with the Angel and prevailed.'
" He was ordered to appear before Parliament to answer the charge of high treason, although a man of
scholarly attainments and rare genius. At times he was depressed and gloomy; especially was this the case
when he was first banished and silenced from preaching, for there were many murmurings and charges
against him. But his losses and crosses were so sanctified that Christ became more and more to him.
</p>
<p>
Marvelous are the statements of his estimate of Christ. This devoted man of prayer wrote many letters during
his exile to preachers, to state officers, to lords temporal and spiritual, to honourable and holy men, to
honourable and holy women, all breathing an intense devotion to Christ, and all born of a life of great
devotion to prayer. Ardour and panting after God have been characteristics of great souls in all ages of the
Church and Samuel Rutherford was a striking example of this fact. He was a living example of the truth that
he who prays always, will be enveloped in devotion and joined to Christ in bonds of holy union.
</p>
<p>
Then there was Henry Martyn, scholar, saint, missionary, and apostle to India. Martyn was born February 18,
1781, and sailed for India August 31, 1805. He died at Tokai, Persia, October 16, 1812. Here is part of what
he said about himself while a missionary:
"What a knowledge of man and acquaintance with the Scriptures, and what communion with God and study
of my own heart ought to prepare me for the awful work of a messenger from God on business of the soul."
</p>
<p>
Said one of this consecrated missionary: "Oh, to be able to emulate his excellencies, his elevation of piety, his
diligence, his superiority to the world, his love for souls, his anxiety to improve all occasions to do souls good,
his insight into the mystery of Christ, and his heavenly temper! These are the secrets of the wonderful
impression he made in India."
</p>
<p>
It is interesting and profitable to note some of the things which Martyn records in his diary. Here is an
example: "The ways of wisdom appear more sweet and reasonable than ever," he says, "and the world more
insipid and vexatious. The chief thing I mourn over is my want of power, and lack of fervour in secret prayer,
especially when attempting to plead for the heathen. Warmth does not increase within me in proportion to my
light." If Henry Martyn, so devoted, ardent and prayerful, lamented his lack of power and want of fervour in
prayer, how ought our cold and feeble praying abase us in the very dust? Alas, how rare are such praying men
in the Church of our own day!
Again we quote a record from his diary. He had been quite ill, but had recovered and was filled with
thankfulness because it had pleased God to restore him to life and health again. "Not that I have yet recovered
my former strength," he says, "but I consider myself sufficiently restored to prosecute my journey. My daily
prayer is that my late chastisement may have its intended effect, and make me, all the rest of my days, more
humble and less self-confident. "Self-confidence has often led me down fearful lengths, and would, without
God's gracious interference, prove my endless perdition. I seem to be made to feel this evil of my heart more
than any other at this time. In prayer, or when I write or converse on the subject, Christ appears to me my life
and my strength; but at other times I am thoughtless and bold, as if I had all life and strength in myself. Such
neglects on our part are a diminution of our joys."
</p>
<p>
Among the last entries in this consecrated missionary's journal we find the following: I sat in the orchard and
thought, with sweet comfort and peace, of my God, in solitude, my Company, my Friend, my Comforter. Oh,
when shall time give place to eternity!" Note the words, "in solitude," - away from the busy haunts of men, in
a lonely place, like his Lord, he went out to meditate and pray. Brief as this summary is, it suffices to show
how fully and faithfully Henry Martyn exercised his ministry of prayer. The following may well serve to end
our portrayal of him: "By daily weighing the Scriptures, with prayer, he waxed riper and riper in his ministry.
</p>
<p>
Prayer and the Holy Scriptures were those wells of salvation out of which he drew daily the living water for
his thirsty immortal soul. Truly may it be said of him, he prayed always with all prayer and supplication, in
the Spirit, and watched thereunto with all perseverance."
</p>
<p>
David Brainerd, the missionary to the Indians, is a remarkable example of a praying man of God. Robert Hale
thus speaks of him: " Such invincible patience and self-denial; such profound humility, exquisite prudence,
indefatigable industry; such devotedness to God, or rather such absorption of the whole soul in zeal for the
divine glory and the salvation of men, is scarcely to be paralleled since the age of the Apostles. Such was the
intense ardour of his mind that it seems to have diffused the spirit of a martyr over the common incidents of his
life."
</p>
<p>
Dr. A. J. Gordon speaks thus of Brainerd: " In passing through Northampton, Mass., I went into the old
cemetery, swept off the snow that lay on the top of the slab, and I read these simple words: 'Sacred to the
memory of David Brainerd, the faithful and devoted missionary to the Susquehanna, Delaware and
Stockbridge Indians of America, who died in this town, October 8th, 1717.' "That was all there was on the
slab. Now that great man did his greatest work by prayer. He was in the depths of those forests alone, unable
to speak the language of the Indians, but he spent whole days literally in prayer. What was he praying for? He
knew he could not reach these savages, for he did not understand their language. If he wanted to speak at all,
he must find somebody who could vaguely interpret his thought. Therefore he knew that anything he could do
must be absolutely dependent upon God. So he spent whole days in praying, simply that the power of the
Holy Ghost might come upon him so unmistakably that these people would not be able to stand before him.
</p>
<p>
"What was his answer? Once he preached through a drunken interpreter, a man so intoxicated that he could
hardly stand up. This was the best he could do. Yet scores were converted through that sermon. We can
account for it only that it was the tremendous, power of God behind him.
</p>
<p>
"Now this man prayed in secret in the forest. A little while afterward, William Carey read his life, and by its
impulse he went to India. Payson read it as a young man, over twenty years old, and he said that he had never
been so impressed by anything in his life as by the story of Brainerd. Murray McCheyne read it, and he
likewise was impressed by it. "But all I care is simply to enforce this thought, that the hidden life, a life
whose days are spent in communion with God, in trying to reach the source of power, is the life that moves the
world. Those living such lives may be soon forgotten. There may be no one to speak a eulogy over them
when they are dead. The great world may take no account of them. But by and by, the great moving current of
their lives will begin to tell, as in the case of this young man, who died at about thirty years of age. The
missionary spirit of this nineteenth century is more due to the prayers and consecration of this one man than
to any other one. "So I say. And yet that most remarkable thing is that Jonathan Edwards, who watched over
him all those months while he was slowly dying of consumption, should also say: 'I praise God that it was in
His Providence that he should die in my house, that I might hear his prayers, and that I might witness his
consecration, and that I might be inspired by his example.' "When Jonathan Edwards wrote that great appeal
to Christendom to unite in prayer for the conversion of the world, which has been the trumpet call of modern
missions, undoubtedly it was inspired by this dying missionary."
</p>
<p>
To David Brainerd's spirit, John Wesley bore this testimony: I preached and afterward made a collection for
the Indian schools in America. A large sum of money is now collected. But will money convert heathens? Find
preachers of David Brainerd's spirit, and nothing can stand before them. But without this, what will gold or
silver do? No more than lead or iron." Some selections from Brainerd's diary will be of value as showing what
manner of man he was: "My soul felt a pleasing yet painful concern," he writes, "lest I should spend some
moments without God. Oh, may I always live to God! In the evening I was visited by some friends, and spent
the time in prayer, and such conversation as tended to edification. It was a comfortable season to my soul. I
felt an ardent desire to spend every moment with God. God is unspeakably gracious to me continually. In time
past, He has given me inexpressible sweetness in the performance of duty. Frequently my soul has enjoyed
much of God, but has been ready to say, 'Lord, it is good to be here;' and so indulge sloth while I have lived
on the sweetness of my feelings. But of late God has been pleased to keep my soul hungry almost continually,
so that I have been filled with a kind of pleasing pain. When, I really enjoy God, I feel my desires of Him the
more insatiable, and my thirstings after holiness the more unquenchable.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that I may feel this continual hunger, and not be retarded, but rather animated by every cluster from
Canaan, to reach forward in the narrow way, for the full enjoyment and possession of the heavenly
inheritance! Oh, may I never loiter in my heavenly journey I " It seems as if such an unholy wretch as I never
could arrive at that blessedness, to be holy as God is holy. At noon I longed for sanctification and conformity
to God. Oh, that is the one thing, the all! Toward night enjoyed much sweetness in secret prayer, so that my
soul longed for an arrival in the heavenly country, the blessed paradise of God."
</p>
<p>
If inquiry be made as to the secret of David Brainerd's heavenly spirit, his deep consecration and exalted
spiritual state, the answer will be found in the last sentence quoted above. He was given to much secret prayer,
and was so close to God in his life and spirit that prayer brought forth much sweetness to his inner soul. We
have cited the foregoing cases as illustrative of the great fundamental fact that God's great servants are men
devoted to the ministry of prayer; that they are God's agents on earth who serve Him in this way, and who
carry on His work by this holy means. Louis Harms was born in Hanover, in 1809, and then came a time
when he was powerfully convicted of sin. Said he, "I have never known what fear was. But when I came to
the knowledge of my sins, I quaked before the wrath of God, so that my limbs trembled." He was mightily
converted to God by reading the Bible. Rationalism, a dead orthodoxy, and worldliness, held the multitudes
round Hermansburgh, his native town. His father, a Lutheran minister, dying, he became his successor. He
began with all the energy of his soul to work for Christ, and to develop a church of a pure, strong type. The
fruit was soon evident. There was a quickening on every hand, attendance at public services increased,
reverence for the Bible grew, conversation on sacred things revived, while infidelity, worldliness and dead
orthodoxy vanished like a passing cloud. Harms proclaimed a conscious and present Christ, the Comforter, in
the full energy of His mission, the revival of apostolic piety and power. The entire neighbourhood became
regular attendants at church, the Sabbath was restored to its sanctity, and hallowed with strict devotion, family
altars were erected in the homes, and when the noon bell sounded, every head was bowed in prayer. In a very
short time the whole aspect of the country was entirely changed. The revival in Hermansburgh was essentially
a prayer revival, brought about by prayer and yielding fruits of prayer in a rich and an abundant ingathering.

William Carvosso, an old-time Methodist classleader, was one of the best examples which modern times has
afforded of what was probably the religious life of Christians in the apostolic age. He was a prayer-leader, a
class-leader, a steward and a trustee, but never aspired to be a preacher. Yet a preacher he was of the very first
quality, and a master in the art and science of soul-saving. He was a singular instance of a man learning the
simplest rudiments late in life. He had up to the age of sixty-five years never written a single sentence, yet he
wrote letters which would make volumes, and a book which was regarded as a spiritual classic in the great
world-wide Methodist Church. Not a page nor a letter, it is believed, was ever written by him on any other
subject but religion. Here are some of his brief utterances which give us an insight into his religious character.
</p>
<p>
"I want to be more like Jesus." "My soul thirsteth for Thee, O God." "I see nothing will do, O God, but being
continually filled with Thy presence and glory." This was the continual out-crying of his inner soul, and this
was the strong inward impulse which moved the outward man. At one time we hear him exclaiming, " Glory
to God! This is a morning without a cloud." Cloudless days were native to his sunny religion and his gladsome
spirit. Continual prayer and turning all conversation toward Christ in every company and in every home, was
the inexorable law he followed, until he was gathered home. On the anniversary of his spiritual birth when he
was born again, in great joyousness of spirit he calls it to mind, and breaks forth:
"Blessed be Thy name, O God! The last has been the best of the whole. I may say with Bunyan, 'I have got
into that land where the sun shines night and day.' I thank Thee, O my God, for this heaven, this element of
love and joy, in which my soul now lives."
</p>
<p>
Here is a sample of Carvosso's spiritual experiences, of which he had many: "I have sometimes had seasons of
remarkable visitation from the presence of the Lord," he says. "I well remember one night when in bed being
so filled, so overpowered with the glory of God, that had there been a thousand suns shining at noonday, the
brightness of that divine glory would have eclipsed the whole. I was constrained to shout aloud for joy. It was
the overwhelming power of saving grace. Now it was that I again received the impress of the seal and the
earnest of the Spirit in my heart. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord I was changed into the same
image from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord. Language fails in giving but a faint description of what I
there experienced. I can never forget it in time nor to all eternity. "Many years before I was sealed by the
Spirit in a somewhat similar manner. While walking out one day, I was drawn to turn aside on the public road,
and under the canopy of the skies, I was moved to kneel down to pray. I had not long been praying with God
before I was so visited from Him that I was overpowered by the divine glory, and I shouted till I could be
heard at a distance. It was a weight of glory that I seemed incapable of bearing in the body, and therefore I
cried out, perhaps unwisely, Lord, stay Thy hand. In this glorious baptism these words came to my heart with
indescribable power: 'I have sealed thee unto the day of redemption.'
"Oh, I long to be filled more with God! Lord, stir me up more in earnest. I want to be more like Jesus. I see
that nothing will do but being continually filled with the divine presence and glory. I know all that Thou hast
is mine, but I want to feel a close union. Lord, increase my faith."
</p>
<p>
Such was William Carvosso - a man whose life was impregnated with the spirit of prayer, who lived on his
knees, so to speak, and who belonged to that company of praying saints which has blessed the earth.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan Edwards must be placed among the praying saints - one whom God mightily used through the
instrumentality of prayer. As in the instance of the great New Englander, purity of heart should be ingrained in
the very foundation areas of every man who is a true leader of his fellows and a minister of the Gospel of
Christ and a constant practicer in the holy office of prayer. A sample of the utterances of this mighty man of
God is here given in the shape of a resolution which he formed, and wrote down:
"Resolved," he says, "to exercise myself in this all my life long, viz., with the greatest openness to declare my
ways to God, and to lay my soul open to God - all my sins, temptations, difficulties, sorrows, fears, hopes,
desires, and everything and every circumstance."
</p>
<p>
We are not surprised, therefore, that the result of such fervid and honest praying was to lead him to record in
his diary: "It was my continual strife day and night, and my constant inquiry how I should be more holy, and
live more holily. The heaven I desired was a heaven of holiness. I went on with my eager pursuit after more
holiness and conformity to Christ."
</p>
<p>
The character and work of Jonathan Edwards were exemplifications of the great truth that the ministry of
prayer is the efficient agency in every truly God-ordered work and life. He himself gives some particulars
about his life when a boy. He might well be called the "Isaiah of the Christian dispensation." There was
united in him great mental powers, ardent piety, and devotion to study, unequalled save by his devotion to
God. Here is what he says about himself: "When a boy I used to pray five times a day in secret, and to spend
much time in religious conversation with other boys. I used to meet with them to pray together. So it is God's
will through His wonderful grace, that the prayers of His saints should be one great and principal means of
carrying on the designs of Christ's kingdom in the world. Pray much for the ministers and the Church of God."
</p>
<p>
The great powers of Edwards' mind and heart were exercised to procure an agreed union in extraordinary
prayer of God's people everywhere. His life, efforts and his character are an exemplification of his statement.
</p>
<p>
"The heaven I desire," he says, "is a heaven spent with God; an eternity spent in the presence of divine love,
and in holy communion with Christ."
</p>
<p>
At another time he said: The soul of a true Christian appears like a little white flower in the spring of the year,
low and humble on the ground, opening its bosom to receive the pleasant beams of the sun's glory, rejoicing
as it were in a calm rapture, diffusing around a sweet fragrance, standing peacefully and lovingly in the midst
of other flowers." Again he writes:
"Once as I rode out in the woods for my health, having alighted from my horse in a retired place, as my
manner has been to walk for divine contemplation and prayer, I had a view, that for me was extraordinary, of
the glory of the Son of God as Mediator between God and man, and of His wonderful, great, full, pure, and
sweet grace and love, and His meek and gentle condescension. This grace that seemed so calm and sweet,
appeared also great above the heavens. The person of an excellency Christ appeared ineffably excellent with
great enough to swallow up all thought and conception, which continued, as near as I can judge, about an
hour. It kept me the greater part of the time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud. I felt an ardency of soul to
be, what I know not otherwise how to express, emptied and annihilated, to lie in the dust; to be full of Christ
alone, to love Him with my whole heart."
</p>
<p>
As it was with Jonathan Edwards, so it is with all great intercessors. They come into that holy and elect
condition of mind and heart by a thorough self-dedication to God, by periods of God's revelation to them,
making distinct marked eras in their spiritual history, eras never to be forgotten, in which faith mounts up
with wings as eagles, and has given it a new and fuller vision of God, a stronger grasp of faith, a sweeter,
clearer vision of all things heavenly, and eternal, and a blessed intimacy with, and access to, God.
